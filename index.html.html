</div>
<p>In spring 1994 I took my ships on a four-month commercial expedition down Siberia's Ob River, from Novosibirsk to Salekhard, a town above the Arctic Circle. The expedition's purpose was to establish economic ties with the regions of the Far North.</p><p>
The expedition was called the Merchant Caravan. Our large triple-decker ship held the caravan's headquarters, an exhibit of what Siberia's entrepreneurs were producing, and a store. And my quarters, quite stylish for those times. We had combined two first-class cabins and furnished them with modern pieces in order to impress when we were conducting negotiations.</p><p>
My caravan was to travel three and a half thousand kilometers to the north and stop at both relatively large settlements—Tomsk, Nizhnevartovsk, Khanty-Mansiisk, and Salekhard—as well as ones so small they could only be reached with freight during the brief navigable period.</p><p>
In the winter, the Ob River ices over. Communication between the towns and the residents of Siberian settlements comes to a halt.</p><p>
Afternoons, the caravan's ships docked at points of settlement. The crew blew the ship's whistles and then pumped loud music through powerful speakers on the upper deck, attracting the inhabitants.</p><p>
We traded, bought valuable fish from the local population and the gifts of the Siberian taiga—whortleberries, dried mushrooms, and furs—and discussed establishing permanent economic ties with local hunters and fishermen.</p><p>
The ships traveled at night, as a rule. If bad weather prevented us from continuing along the river, the headquarters ship would moor at the nearest point of settlement and we would hold a party for the local youth. Events like that were a rarity there. The clubs and houses of culture had become quite ramshackle over the previous years, and almost no cultural events were being held.</p><p>
You can only imagine the response.</p><p>
Inhabitants of a Siberian village thousands of kilometers from civilization see a beauty of a white ship sailing along the river and suddenly it turns and moors at their shore.
The ship has a restaurant, a bar, and a dance hall with columns.</p><p>
Not only all the young people but all the adults as well would rush to go on board, take a three-hour cruise, and then see the white beauty off, waving from shore.</p><p>
The farther the caravan got from the big towns and the closer to the Arctic Circle, the broader the Ob got, and through binoculars you could observe wild animals on its shores.</p><p>
Sometimes we did not encounter a single even tiny point of settlement in twenty-four hours of sailing. Nothing but taiga along the banks of the river, which was the sole transportation artery for many kilometers.</p><p>
At the time, I did not yet know that at one of these kilometers a meeting awaited me that would change my entire life.</p><p>
One day on our way back to Novosibirsk, I had our floating headquarters moor at a tiny village consisting of just a few small houses, tens of kilometers from any large points of settlement. We planned to stop for three hours so that the ship's crew could walk on land, the local residents could buy various goods and foods, and we could buy their wild taiga plants and fish cheaply.</p><p>
I decided to take a walk on land as well. As I was going down the gangway, I couldn’t help but notice two old men standing in silence off to one side of the group of local inhabitants planning to climb the gangway onto the ship.</p><p>
The older man had a gray beard and was wearing a canvas cape that went down to his heels and a hood that covered his head and looked especially odd. As I walked past the old men I said hello. The elder said nothing to me in reply, merely bowed his head slightly, but his companion greeted me.</p><p>
"Hello. May your good intentions come to pass. I sense you're in charge here. Right? Can you give orders?"</p><p>
"Yes, if they're sensible," I replied, and I was about to proceed on my way.</p><p>
But the old man continued.</p><p>
He tried to talk me into giving him fifty or so men (the ship's crew totaled sixty-five in all) for him to take into the taiga, twenty-five kilometers from where the ship was moored. Take them deep into the taiga to cut down a ringing cedar, as they put it. A cedar that, according to him, reached forty meters high. He proposed cutting it up into pieces that could be carried to the ship. We had to collect all of it without fail. The old man advised cutting each part into even smaller pieces, each taking one for ourselves, and giving the rest out to our families, acquaintances, and anyone who wanted one as a gift. The old man said this was a special cedar. The piece of it had to be worn on the chest, on a string. Moreover, you had to put it on while standing barefoot in the grass and with your left hand pressed to your bared chest. A minute later you would feel a pleasant warmth emanating from the cedar, and then a light shudder would pass through your body. From time to time, when the desire arose, you would need to use your fingertips to polish the side of the piece of cedar that did not touch the body, holding it with your thumbs on the other side. The old man confidently asserted that three months later the person possessing the piece of ringing cedar would feel a significant improvement in his well-being and would be healed of many diseases.</p><p>
"Even AIDS?" I asked, after telling them briefly what I knew from the press about this disease.</p><p>
The old man answered confidently, "Any disease!"</p><p>
In his opinion, however, this was an easy task. The main thing was that the person possessing this piece would become better, luckier, and abler.</p><p>
I knew a little about the healing properties of our Siberian taiga cedar, but for it to affect our emotions and abilities—at the time that seemed highly improbable. I thought, "Maybe the old men want to get some money from me for this, what they consider an unusual cedar." I began explaining to them that in the "outside world," in order to be liked, women wear jewelry made of gold and silver, and they wouldn't pay for a piece of wood, so I was not going to agree to any costs.</p><p>
"They wear it not knowing," the answer followed. "Gold is dust compared with one little piece of this cedar, but we don't need any money for it, we can give you mushrooms, dried ones, too, but we don't need anything."</p><p>
Deciding not to argue, out of respect for their age, I said, "Well, maybe someone would wear a piece of your cedar if a master carver put his hand to it and created something unusually beautiful."</p><p>
To this the old man replied, "You can carve it, but it's better to polish it. And much better if you polish it yourself, with your own fingers, when that person's soul wants to, and then the cedar will be beautiful on the outside, too."</p><p>
At this, the slightly younger old man quickly unbuttoned first his old jacket and then his shirt and showed me what he had on his chest. I saw a convex circle or oval. The colors in it were variegated—violet, crimson, a rust color—and comprised a puzzling drawing, and the veins of the tree looked like rivulets.</p><p>
I'm no connoisseur of works of art, although I have had occasion to visit a few art galleries. World masterpieces have never summoned up any special emotion in me, but what was hanging on this old man's chest called up significantly greater feelings and emotions than a visit to the Tretyakov Gallery. I asked the old man, "How many years have you been polishing your piece of cedar?"</p><p>
"Ninety-three," the old man replied.</p><p>
"And how old are you?"</p><p>
"One hundred nineteen."</p><p>
At the time I did not believe his answer. The old man looked about seventy-five. Oblivious to my doubts, or not paying them any mind, the old man, who was a little excited, began trying to convince me that a piece of cedar polished only by the person himself would be beautiful to others, too, in three years. Then it would get better and better, especially for women. A pleasant, beneficial fragrance would come from its possessor's body incomparable to anything created artificially by man!</p><p>
A very pleasant fragrance was indeed coming from the old men. I smelled it, even though I smoke and, like all smokers, my sense of smell has probably dulled.</p><p>
There was one other oddity about the old men.</p><p>
I suddenly began noticing in these strangers' speech phrases uncharacteristic of inhabitants of the North's remotest areas. I remember specific ones even today, even with their intonations.</p><p>
The old man said, "God created the cedar as a reservoir for the energy of the Cosmos.</p><p>
"A man in the state of love gives off an emission. In a fraction of a second it reflects off the planets sailing above the person and once more reaches Earth, giving life to everything alive.</p><p>
"The Sun is one of the planets that reflects far from the full spectrum of this emission.</p><p>
"Only emissions of the forces of light go from the person into the Cosmos. And only a beneficial emission returns from the Cosmos to Earth.</p><p>
"A dark emission comes from someone abiding under the influence of pernicious feelings. A dark emission cannot ascend but rather falls deep into the Earth.</p><p> After it is reflected off the bowels of the Earth it returns to the surface in the form of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and wars.</p><p>
"The highest achievement of a reflected dark emission is the effect on man of its rays, which strengthen the pernicious feelings directly inside him.</p><p>
"The cedar lives for five hundred and fifty years. Its millions of needles catch and accumulate light energy, its entire spectrum, day and night. During the cedar's lifetime, all the bodies that reflect the energy of the forces of light pass over it.</p><p>
"Even a small cedar has more energy that is beneficial to man than all the man-made energy installations on Earth put together.</p><p>
"The cedar takes in the energy that comes from man and through the Cosmos, stores it, and, at the right moment, gives it back. Gives it back when there is not enough of it in the Cosmos, which means in man and everything living and growing on Earth.</p><p>
"One encounters cedars—but very rarely—that store the accumulated energy but do not give it back. After five hundred years of life they begin to ring. That is how they speak, with their quiet ringing. That is how they signal for people to take them, to cut them down so that the accumulated energy can be used on Earth. And so this cedar has been asking with its ringing. It's been asking for three years. If it doesn't make physical contact with living people, then in three years it loses its chance to give up what it has accumulated through the Cosmos, loses its chance to give it back to man directly. Then it starts burning the energy inside itself. This tortuous burning and dying takes twenty-seven years.</p><p>
"Not long ago we discovered a cedar like that. We determined it had already been ringing for two years — ringing softly, very softly. It might be trying to stretch its request out for a longer time, but it has only one year left. It has to be cut down and distributed to people."</p><p>
The old man spoke for a long time, and for some reason I listened. The odd old Siberian's voice first was calmly confident, then very agitated, and when he was agitated, he would polish his piece of cedar with his fingertips quickly, as if fingering some musical instrument.</p><p>
It was cold on shore and an autumn wind was blowing off the river. The cold wind raked the gray hair on the old man's uncovered head in bursts, but his old jacket and shirt remained unbuttoned. His fingertips kept polishing his piece of cedar, which hung on his chest open to the wind. He was trying to explain its full significance.</p><p>
Lidia Petrovna, an employee in my firm, came off the ship and onto shore. She said everyone had already gathered on board, they were ready to sail, and they were waiting for me to finish my conversation. I said goodbye to the old men and quickly boarded. I could not satisfy their request for two reasons: delaying the ship, and for three full days, would have meant a huge loss; and at the time I ascribed everything the old men said to excessive superstition.
The next morning, during our planning meeting, I suddenly saw Lidia Petrovna fingering a piece of cedar on her chest. Later she told me that when I had gone on board she had hung back a little. As I began to walk away, she saw the old man look, distraught, first at me as I left and then at his older companion.</p><p>
He repeated agitatedly, "How can that be? Why didn’t they realize? I don't know how to speak their language at all. I couldn't convince him. I couldn't! Nothing I said worked! Nothing worked. Why? Tell me, father."</p><p>
The elder of the two old men placed his hand on his son's shoulder and replied calmly, "You were not convincing, my son. That is why they did not realize."
"When I was already going up the gangway," Lidia Petrovna continued, "the old man who'd been talking to you suddenly ran up to me, grabbed me by the arm, and led me down the gangway onto the grass.</p><p>
"He hastily took the string to which this piece of cedar wood was attached out of his pocket, put it around my neck, and pressed it with my own hand to my chest. I even felt a shudder in my body. He did it all so very quickly, I never had a chance to say anything to him. As I was walking away he repeated after me, 'Safe travels! Be happy! Please, come here next year! All the best, people. We'll be waiting for you! Safe travels!'</p><p>
"When the ship cast off, the old man waved for a long time and then suddenly sat down on the grass. I watched them through my binoculars. I saw the old man you'd been talking to, who had later given me the piece of cedar, sitting on the grass and his shoulders quaking. The older one, with the long beard, was leaning over him and stroking his head.</p><p>
<div class=section>* * *</div></p><p>
Immersed in my commercial concerns, bookkeeping, and banquets celebrating the conclusion of our travels, I forgot all about the strange old Siberians.</p><p>
When the ship returned to Novosibirsk I experienced acute pains and was given a diagnosis of a duodenal ulcer and osteochondrosis of my thoracic spine.
In the quiet of my comfortable hospital ward, I was cut off from the daily bustle. My deluxe private room gave me a chance to calmly analyze the results of my four-month expedition and compile a business plan for the future. But my memory seemed to push all the events away and for some reason brought to the fore the old men and what they'd said.</p><p>
At my request the hospital got me all the literature there was on the cedar tree.</p><p>
Comparing what I read with what I'd heard on the expedition from the old Siberians, I was increasingly struck by and began to believe what the old men had said. If there was some truth in what they'd said, could all of it have been the truth?</p><p>
The books on folk medicine said a lot about the cedar's healing properties. They said that all of it, from its needles to its bark, possessed highly effective healing properties. The Siberian cedar's wood is beautiful and can be put to good use by master craftsmen, and furniture and sounding boards for musical instruments can be made from it. The cedar's needles possess a high level of phytoncides and the ability to easily decontaminate the ambient air. The cedar's wood has a characteristic, very pleasant balsamic fragrance. A small piece of cedar in a home drives away moths.</p><p>
The popular scientific literature also indicated that the quality of cedars that grow in northern regions is significantly higher than that of those in more southerly regions.</p><p>
In 1792 Academician P. S. Pallas wrote that the fruits of the Siberian cedar effectively restored male virility and returned a person's youth, significantly increased the organism's resistance, and helped him withstand many diseases.</p><p>
There were also many historical phenomena directly or indirectly linked to the cedar. Here is one of them.</p><p>
In 1907 the semiliterate muzhik Grigory Rasputin, who came from a remote Siberian village, an area where the Siberian cedar grows, arrived in the capital of St. Petersburg at the age of fifty and astounded even the imperial family, to which he gained entrée, with his predictions. He possessed extraordinary virility. When they tried to kill Grigory Rasputin, they were astounded that he continued to live after he had been riddled with bullets. Could this have been because he grew up on the cedar's nuts in a cedar region?</p><p>
This is how journalists of the day assessed his stamina:</p><p>
"At age fifty, he could start an orgy at midday and keep up his carousing until four in the morning. He would go from debauchery and drunkenness straight to church matins, where he would stand in prayer until eight o'clock in the morning. Then, at home, after tea, Grishka would receive visitors until two in the afternoon, as if nothing had happened. Then he would select some ladies and go with them to the bathhouse, and from the bathhouse he would drive to a restaurant outside the city, where he would repeat the previous night. No ordinary person could withstand a routine like that."</p><p>
Nonetheless, the numerous facts and proofs pale before the most important thing, which you can learn for yourself and after which I was left without a shadow of doubt: the Bible. In the Old Testament, in the third book of Moses (Leviticus 14:4), God teaches how to heal people, even how to decontaminate a dwelling using . . . CEDAR!!!</p><p>
When I compared the facts and information I had collected from various sources, a picture took shape such that the world's known miracles paled by comparison. The great mysteries that had disturbed men's minds began to seem trifling compared to the mystery of the ringing cedar. I could no longer have any doubt of its existence. The popular scientific literature and the Old Testament dispelled my doubts.</p><p>
The cedar is mentioned forty-two times in the Bible, in the Old Testament. The Old Testament Moses, who revealed to humanity the stone tablets, probably knew more about the cedar than is written in the Old Testament.</p><p>
We are used to the fact of various plants in nature being capable of healing man's ailments. Cedar's healing properties are confirmed by the popular scientific literature and such serious and authoritative scientists as Academician P. S. Pallas, and this coincides with what the Old Testament says.
Now, pay attention!</p><p>
The Old Testament points to the cedar and only the cedar and does not mention any other trees. Doesn't the Old Testament talk about how the cedar is the most powerful therapeutic agent that exists in nature? What is this? A medicinal complex? But how should it be used? And why had these strange old men chosen one ringing cedar out of all the cedars?</p><p>
But this was still not all. The following Old Testament story talks about something immeasurably more puzzling.</p><p>
King Solomon built a temple of cedar. In exchange for cedar from the Levant, he gave another king, Hiram, twenty towns of his own kingdom. Incredible! Twenty towns for a certain kind of building material! True, he was rendered one other service as well. At King Solomon's request he was given men "able to hew the trees."</p><p>
Who were these people? What did they know?</p><p>
I'd heard that even now, in the remotest places, there were old men who had a special skill for choosing trees for construction. But then, more than two thousand years ago, everyone might have had that skill. It took special people, though. The temple was built. Services were held in it and "the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud."</p><p>
What kind of cloud? Where did it come from and how did it get into the temple? What was it? Energy? Spirit? What manner of phenomenon was it, and what was its connection to the cedar?</p><p>
The old men had spoken of the ringing cedar as a reservoir for some sort of energy.</p><p>
Which cedar was more powerful, the Levant's or Siberia's?</p><p>
Academician Pallas said that its healing properties increased as the growth approached the boundary with the forest tundra. That meant the Siberian was more powerful.</p><p>
The Bible says, "You will know them by their fruits." That means the Siberian again!</p><p>
Had no one ever paid any attention to all this before?</p><p>
Hadn't someone compared these facts?</p><p>
The Old Testament, the science of the last century, and modern science were one in their opinion of the cedar.</p><p>
In Living Ethics, Elena Ivanovna Roerikh writes, "The chalice of cedar resin appeared long ago in the rituals of consecration of the kings of ancient Khorasan.</p><p>
"The Druids also had a goblet of cedar resin, which was called the Chalice of Life. Only later was it replaced by blood, when the awareness of the Spirit was lost. Zoroastrian fire came from burning resin in a chalice."</p><p>
So what—of all our forefathers' knowledge about the cedar, its properties, and its uses—has come down to our days and been preserved? Nothing at all? What did the old Siberians know about it?</p><p>
All of a sudden, the memory surfaced of a situation from many years before that gave me gooseflesh. At the time, I'd lent it no significance, but now. . . .</p><p>
At the beginning of perestroika, I, as president of the Siberian association of entrepreneurs, had had a call from the Novosibirsk Regional Executive Committee (in those days there were still Communist Party organizations) asking me to come meet with a major Western businessman. He had a letter of recommendation from the government. Present at the meeting were several entrepreneurs and regional committee staff.</p><p>
Judging by his appearance, the Western businessman was a tough and unusual man of the Oriental type. He was wearing a turban and expensive rings adorned his fingers.</p><p>
We spoke, as usual, about opportunities for cooperation in various spheres. Among other things he said, "We might buy cedar nuts from you." As he said this he actually tensed up, and his sharp eyes darted, probably studying the reaction of the entrepreneurs present. I remembered this well because at the time I'd wondered why it was he had changed so.</p><p>
After the official meeting the Muscovite interpreter accompanying him approached me. She said he wanted to speak with me.</p><p>
The businessman proposed, confidentially, that I organize deliveries of cedar nuts for him, which had to be fresh, and in addition to the official price I would have a sizable percentage for myself.</p><p>
I was supposed to deliver the nuts to Turkey, where they made some kind of oil. I said I would think it over.</p><p>
I decided to find out what this oil was. And I did.</p><p>
On the London stock exchange, the standard for world prices, cedar nut oil cost as much as five hundred dollars for one kilogram! We were being offered two or three dollars for a single kilogram of cedar nuts.</p><p>
I called an entrepreneur I knew in Warsaw and asked him to find out whether there was any possibility of selling directly to the consumer of this product and to discover the technology for extracting the oil.</p><p>
A month later he replied.</p><p>
"No possible solution. I could not get hold of the technology. Also, these questions of yours generally have set in motion forces in the West best left alone and forgotten."</p><p>
Then I went to an old acquaintance of mine, a researcher at our Novosibirsk Consumer Cooperative Institute, bought nuts, and financed the work. This institute's laboratories produced about a hundred kilograms of cedar nut oil.</p><p>
I also hired people who discovered the following in archival documents.</p><p>
During the prerevolutionary period and for a short while after the revolution, there was an organization in Siberia known as Siberian Cooperator. The people in this organization traded in oil, including cedar nut oil. They had fairly luxurious offices in Harbin, China, London, and New York, and fairly large sums of money in Western banks. After the revolution, this organization fell apart and many of its members emigrated.</p><p>
Krasin, a member of the Bolshevik government, met with the organization's head and suggested that he return to Russia, but the head of Siberian Cooperator replied that he would not help Russia anymore, now that he was outside its borders.</p><p>
The archival materials also said that the cedar oil was made using wooden—and only wooden—presses in many of Siberia's taiga villages.
The high quality of the cedar oil depended on when the nuts were collected and processed.</p><p>
We were unable to determine when this was, either in the archives or at the institute. The secret was lost.</p><p>
The oil's healing properties have no analog. Might one of the émigrés have given the secret for manufacturing this oil to someone in the West?</p><p>
What explained the fact that the immensely healing cedar nut grew in Siberia but the oil's production was in Turkey? After all, the cedar variety found in Siberia does not grow in Turkey at all.</p><p>
What forces in the West was the Warsaw entrepreneur referring to? Why should I leave this question alone? Weren't these forces pumping this extraordinary healing product out of Russia's Siberian taiga?</p><p>
If we had such wealth at home, with highly effective properties confirmed by centuries and millennia, why were we buying millions, maybe even billions of dollars' worth of Western medicines and consuming them like half-wits? Why were we losing knowledge known to our forefathers? Recent forefathers, who had lived in our own century!</p><p>
To say nothing of the Bible, which describes an unusual situation from more than two thousand years ago! What unknown forces were working so assiduously to wipe our forefathers' knowledge from our memory? And not only that, but trying to keep us from sticking our nose where it didn't belong. They were trying to wipe it away—and succeeding!</p><p>
I was gripped by fury. I also saw that the pharmacy was selling cedar oil—in imported packaging. I bought one thirty-gram vial and had it tested. I don't think it contained more than two drops of oil. The rest was some kind of diluting agent. It didn't compare with what we had manufactured at the consumer cooperation institute. And these two diluted drops cost fifty thousand rubles! What if we sold it ourselves, rather than purchase it abroad? All of Siberia could live well off this oil alone!</p><p>
We had managed to forget our forefathers' technology, and now, here we were, sniveling that we lived poorly.</p><p>
All right, I thought, I could still retrieve something. I would set up production of the oil myself and let my own firm get rich.</p><p>
I decided on another expedition down the Ob, to the north, taking only my headquarters ship, the Patrice Lumumba. I loaded various goods in the holds and equipped the ship's screening room as a store. I had to hire new people to work. I was not going to ask people from my own firm. My financial affairs had deteriorated while I'd been distracted.</p><p>
Two weeks after we left Novosibirsk, my security team reported overhearing conversations about the ringing cedar. In their opinion, I had taken on "odd people" among the new hires, to put it mildly. I started calling in individual crew members and talking with them about the upcoming trip into the taiga. Some agreed to go even for free. Others asked for large sums of money for the operation because it had not been part of the agreement when they hired on. It was one thing to be in comfortable conditions on a ship and another to hike twenty-five kilometers into the taiga and carry out a load.</p><p>
By then my funds were running short. I was not planning to sell the cedar. After all, the old men had said it had to be given away. And I believed the main thing was not the cedar itself but the secret of extracting its oil. And in general I was interested in finding out all kinds of information connected with it.</p><p>
Gradually, with the help of my security team, I became convinced that I was being followed, especially when I went ashore, but to what end was unclear, as were the people behind the surveillance. I thought and thought about what to do and decided that in order not to foul things up, I somehow had to outwit everyone in one fell swoop.</p><p>

<h2>2. Meeting</h2>

<img class=kumar src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Meeting-vk.com-kumar82.png></div>
<p>Without explaining anything to anyone, I ordered the ship to stop not far from where I had met the old men the previous year. I took a small launch to the settlement myself, and I ordered the ship's captain to continue along our commercial itinerary.</p><p>I hoped the locals would help me find the two old Siberians I'd spoken with about the ringing cedar the year before so that I could see the cedar with my own eyes and discuss the least expensive way to deliver it to the ship.</p><p>After tying my launch up to a rock on the deserted shore, I was about to head for one of the closest huts when I saw a solitary woman standing on the hillside and started toward her in hopes of getting the information I was interested in from her.</p><p>The woman was wearing an old quilted jacket, a long skirt, and tall rubber galoshes like many people of the remote North wear in fall and spring. Her kerchief was tied so as to completely cover both her forehead and neck. It was hard to tell how old the woman was. I greeted her and told her about the two old men I'd met here the previous year.</p><p>"That was my grandfather and great-grandfather who spoke to you last year, Vladimir," she replied.</p><p>I was amazed. Her voice was young, her diction very precise, and she used the familiar "you" right away and also called me by my name.</p><p>I could not remember the old men's names or whether we had even introduced ourselves. I thought, "We must have if she's calling me by my name." Deciding to use the familiar "you" with her as well, I asked, "And what is your name?"</p><p>"Anastasia," the woman answered, and she held her hand out to me palm down, as if expecting a kiss.</p><p>This gesture from a country woman wearing a quilted jacket and galoshes standing on a deserted shore and trying to behave like a society lady amused me. I shook her hand. Of course I did not kiss it.</p><p>Anastasia smiled in embarrassment and suggested I go into the taiga with her, to where her family lived.</p><p>"Only you have to walk through the taiga, twenty-five kilometers. That doesn't bother you, Vladimir?"</p><p>"It is a little far, of course." I replied to the woman, and to myself I thought, "It's not easy to walk twenty-five kilometers through the taiga, where there aren't any roads. I should take one of my guards, but that would mean chasing down the departed ship, and I have no way of communicating with it." So as not to waste time, I decided to go alone.</p><p>However, I did make my objective known.</p><p>"Will you be able to show me the ringing cedar?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Do you know everything about it, and will you tell me?"</p><p>"I will tell you what I know."</p><p>"Then let's go."</p><p>En route, I questioned Anastasia about how long she had been living in solitude in the taiga.</p><p>Anastasia told me that their family, their clan, had been living in the cedar forest for generations—according to her ancestors, for millennia. Only rarely did they come into direct contact with people from our civilized society. These contacts occurred not where they lived but at those points of settlement they went to in the guise of hunters or people from another settlement.</p><p>Anastasia herself had been to two cities, Tomsk and Moscow. For one day apiece. She had not even spent the night. She had wanted to see whether she was mistaken in her notions of city people's way of life. She had saved up money for the trip by selling berries and dried mushrooms. A local woman had lent her her passport.</p><p>Anastasia did not approve of her grandfather and great-grandfather's idea of passing out the healing ringing cedar to lots of people. When asked why, she said these little pieces would fan out among people doing good and ill both. More than likely, most of the pieces would be snatched up by negative individuals. As a result, they could bring more harm than benefit. The main thing, in her opinion, was to help the good. And the people through whom good was achieved. Helping everyone was not the way to alter the imbalance between good and evil; it would remain as before or get worse.</p><p>After meeting the old Siberians, I had looked through the popular scientific literature and several historical and scientific works that discussed the cedar's unusual properties. Now I tried to go deeper and understand what Anastasia was saying about the way of life the people of the cedar grove deep in the vast Siberian taiga. I thought, "To what and whom can I compare their way of life?"</p><p>I compared them with the Lykov family, whom many people know, I think, from articles in the press. That family, too, lived apart, deep in the taiga, for more than a hundred years.</p><p>When geologists chanced upon them and they were written about in the newspapers, I even recalled one headline, "Taiga Impasse," being discussed on television shows.</p><p>As I read the articles, I formed an impression of the Lykovs as people who knew a lot about nature but little of our modern civilized life. Here we had a very different situation. Anastasia impressed me as someone who had an excellent grasp of the problems of our civilized society and of something else that I did not quite understand. She knew our city life and discussed it easily, freely.</p><p>We had gone about five kilometers, deeper and deeper into the forest, and I was good and tired because there was no path, let alone a road, and I had to step over fallen trees and around bushes. But the woman walking ahead seemed to experience no weariness whatsoever, and I was embarrassed to reveal my weakness to her with a suggestion to stop and rest.</p><p>We came upon a small glade where a stream ran along the edge. The woman said, "You must be tired, Vladimir. If you like, we can rest by this stream."</p><p>"I'm not too tired, but it is time for a bite to eat," I replied, and I immediately sat on the grass at the edge of the glade, started taking sandwiches and a flat bottle of good brandy out of my backpack, and offered Anastasia something to drink.</p><p>But for some reason she would not drink the brandy or eat with me. "I'm not hungry at all, Vladimir. You eat while I bathe in the nice sun."</p><p>After these words, she took three steps away from where I was sitting, removed her jacket, kerchief, and long skirt, and placed them in the hollow of a tree. She was left wearing a light shift. When she removed the kerchief covering the greater part of her face, I nearly choked on my brandy, so struck was I by what I saw. And when she was left wearing only her light shift . . .</p><p>If I believed in miracles I would have ascribed what happened to reincarnation.</p><p>Before me stood a young woman with long golden hair and a magnificent figure. Her beauty was out of the ordinary. It was hard to imagine which of the beauties who had won the most prestigious beauty contests could vie with her for looks and, as later became clear, intellect. Everything about this Siberian hermit was attractive and entrancing.</p><p>Anastasia lay on the grass, her arms flung wide, palms offered to the sun, eyes closed blissfully. I watched her like a man bewitched, forgetting all about my meal.</p><p>Obviously sensing my stare, she turned her head in my direction, looked at me, smiled slightly, and closed her eyes again.</p><p>Her face: no makeup, regular features, sleek skin utterly unlike the weathered faces of remote Siberia's inhabitants, large, good, gray-blue eyes, and slightly smiling lips.</p><p>She was wearing a light shift, sort of like a nightgown, but I got the impression that her body was not cold, even though it was only twelve to fifteen degrees above zero Celsius.</p><p>The sun was reflected as a golden light in her upturned palms. She was beautiful and half-naked.</p><p>I looked at her. My thoughts and feelings became confused. I tried to understand what I should do now and wondered why she'd undressed, why she lay in the grass so tempting and beautiful. Well, why do women of all eras bare their legs, then their breasts, then everything with the help of mini skirts and cleavage? Isn't it to summon the men around her? "Look at how delightful I am, how open and accessible." And what can a man do then? Resist the passion of the flesh, thereby humiliating the woman with his inattention, or show her signs of attention?</p><p>In this situation, what signs of attention was I supposed to give?</p><p>She and I were alone in the taiga, which meant words were not needed, but rather something else. Should I try to kiss her? Or did she want more? I asked,</p><p>"Anastasia, aren't you afraid to walk alone in the taiga?"</p><p>She opened her eyes, turned her head toward me, smiled, and replied, "There's nothing for me to fear here, Vladimir."</p><p>"I wonder how you would defend yourself if you met up with a few muzhiks, geologists, or hunters."</p><p>Instead of answering, she just smiled.</p><p>I thought, "How can this young beauty, so extraordinarily tempting, fear nothing and no one?"</p><p>To this day, I do not understand what happened after that.</p><p>I moved toward Anastasia, who was lying on the grass, embraced her shoulders, and drew her toward me. She did not really resist, although I felt considerable strength in her resilient body. The fragrance of her hair and breath made my head spin a little, and I tried ...</p><p>But I couldn't. The last thing I remember before losing consciousness were her eyes and the words she spoke: "Never mind, Vladimir, calm yourself."</p><p>Also before this I remember being seized by an incredibly powerful and sudden fear—a fear of I don't know what—as in childhood, when you're home all alone and afraid of something.</p><p>When I came to she was kneeling in front of me. One of her hands lay on my chest and the other was waving to someone above and to either side. She was smiling—not at me but at someone who seemed to surround us invisibly or be above us.</p><p>With this gesture, Anastasia seemed to be signaling to her invisible friend that nothing bad was happening to her. Then she looked into my eyes calmly and tenderly and spoke.</p><p>"Calm yourself, Vladimir, it's all over now."</p><p>"But what was it?" I asked.</p><p>"Harmony's failure to understand your attitude toward me, the desire that arose in you. Later you'll be able to sort all this out yourself."</p><p>"What does any kind of harmony have to do with this? It's you! You yourself started to resist."</p><p>"I failed to understand it, too. I didn't like it."</p><p>I sat down and pulled my bag toward me.</p><p>"That's just great! She didn't understand it! She didn't like it! All you women do is try to seduce us. Bare your legs, display your breasts, wear high heels. It's uncomfortable walking on heels, but you do! You do and you wiggle all your charms. But the least little thing and you, 'Oh, I don't need that, I'm not like that. ' Then why do you wiggle? Hypocrites! I'm an entrepreneur, and I've seen all kinds of women. You all want the same thing, you just put on different airs. So why did you take off your outer clothing? It isn't hot! Then you go and stretch out there, you stop talking, and you smile as if..."</p><p>"I'm uncomfortable in clothing, Vladimir. I put it on when I leave the forest and join people, to look like everyone else. I lay down in the sun to rest and not bother you while you ate."</p><p>"You didn’t want to bother me. Well, you did."</p><p>"Forgive me, please, Vladimir. Of course you're right that every woman wants men to notice her, but not just her legs and breasts. She wants that one man who sees more not to walk by."</p><p>"But no one here was walking by! Just what is this more that needs seeing, if her legs are sticking out in front? You women are so illogical."</p><p>"Yes, unfortunately, life is like that sometimes. Shall we go farther, Vladimir? Are you finished eating? Are you rested?"</p><p>The idea flashed through my mind that maybe there was no point going any farther with this philosophical savage. Not only that, but she obviously possessed special abilities, since I'd lost consciousness at the mere touch of her. What should I do? Go back maybe? No, I couldn't find my way back to the river alone. I had to go forward.</p><p>"All right, let's go," I told Anastasia.</p>

</div>

<p>We continued on our way to Anastasia's home. She left her clothing in the tree's hollow. She put her galoshes there, too. She was left in her light shift.</p><p>She took my backpack, offering to help carry it.</p><p>Barefoot, the taiga beauty walked ahead of me with an unusually light and graceful gait, lightly swinging the backpack, which she held with one hand.</p><p>We talked the whole time. Talking with her on any subject was very interesting, maybe because she had rather strange opinions about everything.</p><p>Sometimes Anastasia would spin around as she walked. Turning to face me, she would talk and laugh and walk like that for a while, "ass forward," carried away by the conversation and not watching where she was going. I couldn't understand why she didn't stumble even once or stab her bare foot on a dry bare twig. There was no visible path on our way, but there were none of the usual taiga obstacles either.</p><p>As we went, she would sometimes touch or quickly stroke a leaf or the branch of a bush. Leaning over, without looking, she would tear off an herb and ... eat it.</p><p>"Just like a beast," I thought.</p><p>When we came across berries, Anastasia would hold them out to me and I would eat them as we walked, too.</p><p>Her body was not marked by any special musculature. Basically, Anastasia had an average build. Neither skinny nor fat—a well-nourished, resilient, and very beautiful body. But the strength in it, in my opinion, was considerable, and her reflexes were not bad at all.</p><p>When I tripped and started to fall, my hands stretched out in front, Anastasia turned lightning fast, quickly put out her own hand, the one without the backpack, and my chest fell against her palm and spread fingers. I fell without touching the ground.</p><p>She held my body up with one hand and righted it. At the same time she kept talking about something, not tensing in the least.</p><p>After I straightened up with the help of her hand, we continued on our way as if nothing had happened, and I thought for some reason about the gas gun in my backpack.</p><p>The taiga hermit may have been a beauty, but she had lured me into a situation where I had no protection of any kind from possible nasty accidents.</p><p>Imperceptibly, while we had been talking, we had gone a good ways. Suddenly Anastasia halted, put my backpack under a tree, and joyously informed me, "Here we are! Home!"</p><p>I looked around. A small, neat glade, flowers amid magisterial cedars, but no structures whatsoever. I didn't even see a hut. Nothing at all! Not so much as a primitive temporary shelter! But she was rejoicing as if we had come upon a comfortable dwelling.</p><p>"But where's the house? Where do we sleep, eat, and take cover from the rain?" I asked, barely restraining the alarm in my voice.</p><p>"This is my house, Vladimir. I have everything here."</p><p>A vague sense of alarm began to take hold of me.</p><p>"Where is this everything? Give me a kettle at least to boil water and an ax."</p><p>"I don't have a kettle or an ax, Vladimir, and it would be better not to make a fire."</p><p>"What are you saying? She doesn't even have a kettle! You were the one who invited me to your home, and among normal people, the word 'home' assumes a building with a roof over our head where there's a kitchen, at least one bedroom, and a pantry of food. My bottle of water is empty. You saw that when I was eating. I even threw away the bottle. Now all I have left is a couple of swallows of brandy. It's a day's walk to a river or village, and I'm very tired and thirsty. Where do you get your water? What do you drink from?"</p><p>Seeing my agitation, Anastasia became upset and quickly took my hand and pulled me across the glade into the forest, repeating as we went, "Just don't worry, Vladimir! Please. Don't get upset. I'll take care of everything. You'll rest. Get a good night's sleep. I'll do everything. You won't be cold. You're thirsty? I'll give you something to drink right now."</p><p>All of ten or fifteen meters from the glade, behind some bushes, there turned out to be a small taiga lake before us. Anastasia quickly scooped up a handful of water and brought it to my face.</p><p>"Here is the water. Drink some, please."</p><p>"What's wrong with you, Anastasia? Are you a total savage? How can you drink raw water from a forest puddle? You saw I was drinking Borzhomi. On the ship we even put river water for washing through a special filter, add chlorine, and aerate it."</p><p>"This isn't a puddle, Vladimir. Here we have clean, living water. It's good! Not half dead, like you have. You can drink this water. It's like mother's milk. Look."</p><p>Anastasia brought her hands up to her own face and drank the water from them.</p><p>I blurted out, "Anastasia, are you a beast?"</p><p>"Why a beast? Because my bed isn't like yours? I don't have a car? Or all kinds of devices?"</p><p>"Because you live like a beast, in the forest, have nothing, and apparently like it that way."</p><p>"Yes, I do like living here."</p><p>"There, you see? You confirmed it yourself."</p><p>"Vladimir, do you think the characteristic difference between man and everything living on Earth is that he has artificially created objects?"</p><p>"Yes! Or, to put it more precisely—civilized daily life."</p><p>"You consider your daily life more civilized? Yes, of course, you do. But I am not a beast, Vladimir. I am a human being!"</p>

<h2>4. Who Are They?</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>

<p>Subsequently, in the three days I spent with Anastasia—observing this strange young woman living alone in the remote Siberian taiga—I tried to understand the point of her way of life and could not help but compare it with the way of life of people living in the large metropolises.</p><p>Anastasia lives in the forest completely alone. She has no dwelling, she barely wears clothing, and she does not put up stores of food. She is the descendent of people who have lived here for millennia and were the representatives of an essentially different civilization. She and her kind have been preserved to our day, in my opinion, with the help of a very wise decision, perhaps the only correct decision. They blend in among us, outwardly trying not to stand out in any way from ordinary people, and where they have their permanent residence, they blend with nature.</p><p>Finding the places where they live is hard. Man's presence in such a place can be determined only by the fact that it seems better tended, handsomer, like Anastasia's taiga glade, for example.</p><p>Anastasia was born here and is an inalienable part of nature. Unlike the great hermits we know, she did not retreat to the forest just for a while, as they did. She was born in the taiga and only visits our world briefly. A perfectly simple explanation was found for the seemingly mystic phenomenon, when that powerful fear suddenly flooded me and I lost consciousness in my attempt to overpower Anastasia. Man has tamed the cat, dog, elephant, tiger, and eagle, and here everything around has been tamed. And this everything cannot allow anything bad to happen to her.</p><p>Anastasia told me that when she was born and before she was even a year old, her mother might leave her alone for a whole day.</p><p>"And you didn't starve to death?" I asked.</p><p>The taiga hermit first looked at me in amazement and then replied, "Vladimir, the world was created from the beginning in such a way that man would have no need to waste the energy of his thoughts on where to get food or what kind. Everything around matures in the sequence man requires. You have to eat as you breathe, paying no attention to your nourishment and undistracted from the most important thing. The Creator laid this problem on others so that man could live and carry out his purpose."</p><p>"Do you mean to say that the hundreds of millions of people of the civilized world do not need to be going to work every day to eat properly?"</p><p>"The way of life they've chosen forces them to go to work."</p><p>"What does their way of life have to do with this? The way of life of peasants and farmers is different from a city dweller's, but they too work from morning 'til night to feed their family."</p><p>"And for you to get just one cedar nut, for example, you must have to exert quite a lot of effort. Over there the cedar cones on the tree are high above ground, a good ten meters up."</p><p>"Yes, it is high," Anastasia agreed. "I hadn't thought of that before. I'd always done it the way my grandfather taught me."</p><p>At these words, Anastasia raised her right hand and snapped her fingers. A few minutes later there was a fluffy red squirrel next to Anastasia, who was sitting on the grass.</p><p>The little beast was standing on its hind legs holding a cedar cone in its paws. Anastasia snapped her fingers a second time, paying no attention to the squirrel and continuing the conversation.</p><p>The little beast began quickly husking the cone, taking the cedar nuts out of it, and putting them in a pile. When Anastasia clicked her fingers a third time, the squirrel shelled one nut and jumped smartly onto her palm.</p><p>Anastasia raised the little beast's face to her mouth.</p><p>The squirrel passed the kernel of the cedar nut from his mouth to hers, jumped off her hand, and started shelling the next nut.</p><p>Standing on the ground holding cones in their front paws were more than a dozen other squirrels, and their numbers quickly multiplied. Anastasia slapped the grass a meter away from where I was sitting. All the squirrels started husking the cones and piling the nuts at the indicated spot. Once done with a cone, each squirrel went off for another. A few minutes later a pile of cedar nuts was towering in front of me.</p><p>At first this scene seemed fantastic, but then I recalled how at Novosibirsk's Akademgorodok, whose housing was built in the middle of a pine forest, there were lots of squirrels, which got used to people. The squirrels begged for food from the strolling residents and actually got angry when they weren't given anything. Here I was simply observing the reverse process.</p><p>I told Anastasia, "In the normal world, our world, everything is arranged differently. Just try to click your fingers at a commercial stall, Anastasia. You could beat a drum and they wouldn't give you anything. But you say, 'The Creator solved everything.'"</p><p>"Whose fault is it if man decided to change the Creator's work? For better or worse, try to understand for yourself, Vladimir."</p><p>This was my dialog with her on the problem of nourishment. Anastasia's position is simple. It's sinful to waste thought on what was initially offered in abundance. The way of life in man's artificial world creates problems. It turned out that the hermit Anastasia, residing in the taiga, gave no thought to her nourishment and wasted neither physical nor intellectual energy on it. At the same time, she had top-quality, organic nourishment that was ideally balanced for her organism. So we in the civilized world, it turned out, not only had to think about nourishment but also work for it from morning to night, meanwhile getting food of highly dubious quality.</p><p>We were used to our world and called it civilized. But hadn't men's modern civilization forgotten about the existence of another life, in harmony with nature? What heights could man have reached had he devoted the millennia of his development to the natural rather than the artificial world?</p><p>We know many examples from literature, the press, and television programs of infants who have fallen accidentally into the power of wild nature being suckled by wolves. Here, generations of people had lived continuously in harmony with their environment, and their relationship with the animal world was different from ours. Furthermore, their organism may have had different properties.</p><p>I asked Anastasia, "Why aren't you cold, while I'm wearing a jacket?"</p><p>"Because the organism of people who wrap up in clothing," she said, "who hide from the cold and heat in shelters, steadily loses its ability to adapt to changes in its environment. I haven't lost this property of the human organism, so I don't particularly need clothing."</p>

<h2>5. A Forest Bedroom </h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>

<p>I had no gear with me for sleeping in the wild forest. Anastasia put me to bed in a dugout lair. Exhausted after our difficult journey, I fell asleep hard and fast. When I awoke, I had a sensation of bliss and comfort, as if I'd been lying on a magnificent, comfortable bed.</p><p>The lair, or dugout, was spacious and lined with tiny fluffy cedar twigs and dried grass, which filled the space with a pleasant fragrance.</p><p>Stretching, I flung my arms out to either side. One hand touched a furry hide, and I immediately made a note that Anastasia hunted in some fashion. I moved closer to the fur, pressing my back to its warmth, and decided to doze a little longer.</p><p>Anastasia was standing at the entrance to my taiga bedroom, and when she saw I'd awakened she immediately said, "May today's day come to you with good, Vladimir. And may you meet it with your own good. Only don't be frightened, please."</p><p>She clapped her hands, and the "fur" . . . I realized in horror that this was no hide. A bear began to crawl out of the den cautiously. Receiving an approving slap from Anastasia, the bear licked her hand and began hobbling away from the glade. It turned out that Anastasia had put sleeping herbs at the head of my bed and made the bear lie next to me so I wouldn't be cold. She herself had slept curled up outside, at the entrance.</p><p>"How could you have done such a thing, Anastasia? He might have ripped me to shreds or crushed me."</p><p>"It's not a he, it's a she—a female bear. It is very docile and could not have done anything bad to you," Anastasia replied. "It gets great pleasure from being given a task and carrying it out. It didn't budge the whole night. It poked its nose into my feet and fell blissfully still. It just shuddered a little when you flung your arms around in your sleep and hit it on the back."</p>

<h2>6. Anastasia's Morning</h2> 
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>

<p>When twilight falls, Anastasia goes to bed in one of the shelters made by the inhabitants of the forest, usually a lair. When it's warm, she might sleep right on the grass. The first thing she does when she awakens is rejoice wildly at the rising sun, the new shoots appearing on the branches, and the new sprouts emerging from the earth. She touches them, strokes them, sometimes sets something aright. Then she runs over to the small trees and slaps their trunk. Something like dust or dew showers down on her from the shaking crown. Then she lies down on the grass and for five minutes or so blissfully stretches and bends. Her entire body becomes covered with what seems like a moist cream.</p><p>She takes off at a run, jumps into the small lake, splashes, and dives in—dives wonderfully!</p><p>Her relations with the animal world around her resemble man's relations with domestic animals.</p><p>During her morning routine, many of them observe Anastasia. They don't approach, but all she has to do is look in their direction and make a barely noticeable summoning gesture, and the happy animal is off and running toward her feet.</p><p>One morning I saw her acting the fool, playing with a wolf cub as if it were a pet dog.</p><p>Anastasia slapped the cub on its shoulder and swiftly ran off. The cub ran to catch up, and when they were nearly even, Anastasia suddenly took a leap as she ran, jumped and pushed off a tree trunk with two feet, and took off in another direction.</p><p>The cub kept running past the tree, out of inertia, turned, and raced to catch up with the laughing Anastasia.</p><p>Anastasia doesn't give a moment's thought to the problem of clothing and nourishment. Most often she walks around half- or entirely naked. She eats cedar nuts, some herbs, berries, and mushrooms. She eats only dried mushrooms. She herself never gathers mushrooms or nuts and provisions and puts up no stores, even for winter. Everything is prepared by the many squirrels that inhabit these parts. There is nothing surprising in the fact that the squirrels put up stores of food for winter. They do this everywhere, following their natural instinct. What struck me was something else. At the snap of Anastasia's fingers, the squirrels close to her raced to jump into her outstretched hand and give her a shelled nut. And when Anastasia slapped her bent knee, or the earth, the squirrels made a sound, as if summoning, informing the others, and started dragging out dried mushrooms and other stores and piling them in front of her on the grass. And they did it with tremendous satisfaction, or so it seemed to me. I thought she had trained them, but Anastasia said their actions seemed instinctive, and the mother squirrel herself taught her little squirrels by example.</p><p>"Maybe one of my distant ancestors did train them, but more than likely this is just their predestination. For winter, each squirrel puts away stores that are several times more than it can eat itself."</p><p>When asked how she didn't freeze in winter without appropriate clothing, Anastasia answered with a question: "In your world, don't you have examples of man's abilities to withstand cold without using clothing?"</p><p>Then I remembered the book by Porfiry Ivanov, who went around in any cold wearing underpants and barefoot. The book also described how the fascists, wishing to test the endurance of this unusual Russian man, doused him with water when it was twenty below zero and drove him around naked on a motorcycle.</p><p>In her early childhood, besides her mother's milk, Anastasia could use the milk of various animals. They freely lowered their teats to her. She made absolutely no cult whatsoever of food, never sat down especially to eat, picked berries and plant shoots as she went, and continued to go about her business.</p><p>By the end of three days with her, I could no longer treat her as I had when we first met. After all I had seen and heard, Anastasia had become for me a creature—not a beast, because her intellect is quite high, but her memory—her memory is such that she, of course, forgets nothing she has ever heard or seen. Sometimes her abilities seemed to lie beyond ordinary comprehension, but this attitude toward her caused her much grief and distress.</p><p>Unlike people we know with unusual abilities who wrap themselves in an aura of mystery and exceptionality, she was constantly trying to explain and reveal the mechanism of her abilities, to prove that there was nothing supernatural about them or her, that she was a person, a woman, and she was constantly asking me to be conscious of that. I tried to do so as I sought an explanation for what was so unusual. I tried to consider it rationally.</p><p>The mind of someone from our civilization tries by every means possible to arrange his daily life, obtain nourishment, and satisfy his sexual instincts. Anastasia spent no time on this at all. People who end up in a situation like the Lykovs are also forced to worry constantly about feeding themselves and arranging shelter. Nature does not help them to the degree it does Anastasia.</p><p>Nor do all the various tribes living far from civilization have this contact. Anastasia explained this by saying that their intentions were not sufficiently pure. Nature and the animal world sensed this.</p>

<h2>7. Anastasia's Ray </h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>
<p>What seemed most unusual and mystical to me when I was in the forest was her ability to see individual people and their situations at a great distance. Perhaps other hermits possess this ability as well.</p><p>She did this with the help of an invisible ray. She said every person had one, but people didn't know about it and so couldn't use it.</p><p>"Man has yet to invent anything nature doesn't have. The equipment that makes television possible is just a pathetic likeness of this ray's scope."</p><p>Since the ray was invisible, I didn't believe in it, even though she tried several times to demonstrate and explain the principle of its functioning and find proofs and understandable explanations. Then one day . . .</p><p>"Tell me, Vladimir, what do you think waking dreams are? And are many people capable of them?"</p><p>"I think many do have waking dreams. A waking dream is when a person imagines a desired future."</p><p>"Good. That means you don't deny that man possesses the ability to model his own future and different specific situations, right?"</p><p>"Right."</p><p>"And what is intuition?"</p><p>"Intuition . . . intuition is probably the feeling when someone seems not to be analyzing what might happen or why but certain feelings suggest to him how he needs to act."</p><p>"That means you don't deny the existence in each person of something apart from the usual analytical reasoning that helps him determine his own and others' actions, right?"</p><p>"I guess I don't."</p><p>"Excellent! Good!" Anastasia exclaimed. "Now sleeping dreams! A dream—what is it? The dreams that almost all people have when they sleep."</p><p>"A dream is . . . I don't know what it is. A dream is just a dream."</p><p>"Good, good. Let it just be a dream. That means you don't deny its existence, right? You and others know that when a person is in a dream state, when his body is almost not under the control of part of his consciousness, he can see people and different events."</p><p>"Well, I don't think anyone would deny that."</p><p>"But in dreams people can also communicate, have conversations, and empathize."</p><p>"Yes, they can."</p><p>"And what do you think, can a person direct his own dream? Call up the images and events in his dream that he wishes to see? Like on an ordinary television, for instance."</p><p>"I don't think that would work for anyone. A dream happens all by itself somehow."</p><p>"You're wrong. Man can control everything. He was created to control everything.</p><p>"The ray I've been telling you about consists of the information, notions, intuitions, and emotional sensations man has inside and, as a consequence, the visions, not unlike dreams, that are consciously controlled by man's will."</p><p>"How can you control a dream in your sleep?"</p><p>"Not in your sleep. You can when you're awake. Program it in advance, in a way, and with absolute precision. For you, this happens chaotically in your dream. Man has lost the greater part of his abilities to control natural phenomena and himself. That is why he decided that dreaming was just a superfluous product of his weary brain. In fact, almost all people on earth . . . Well, would you like me to try to help you right now to see something at a distance?"</p><p>"Try away."</p><p>"Lie down on the grass and relax so that your body uses the least possible energy. You have to be comfortable. Nothing is bothering you? Now think about the person you know best of all, your wife, for example. Recall her habits, walk, and clothing, and where you think she might be right now, and picture all this with your imagination."</p><p>I thought of my wife, knowing that at that moment she might be at our country home. I pictured the house, a few things, the surroundings. I recalled a lot and in detail, but I didn't see anything. I told Anastasia this, to which she replied, "You don't know how to relax completely, as if you were just about to fall asleep. I'll help you. Close your eyes. Spread your arms out to either side."</p><p>Then I felt her fingers touch mine and began to plunge into sleep, or slumber. . . .</p><p>. . . My wife was standing in the kitchen of our country home. She had put a knit top over her usual robe. That meant the house was chilly. More problems with the heating system.</p><p>My wife was brewing coffee on the gas burner. And something else in the "dog's pot." My wife's face was sullen and displeased. Her movements were sluggish. All of a sudden she looked up, walked lightly to the window, looked at the rain, and smiled. The coffee boiled over on the burner and she grabbed the pot with the overflowing coffee, but at the same time she did not frown or get irritated, as usual. She took off her top. . . .</p><p>I woke up.</p><p>"Well? Did you see something?" Anastasia asked.</p><p>"Yes. But couldn't that have been an ordinary dream?"</p><p>"What do you mean ordinary? You had planned to see her!"</p><p>"Yes, I had. And I did. But where's the proof that she was there in the kitchen at the moment I saw her in my dream?"</p><p>"Remember this day and hour if you want to verify it, Vladimir. When you get home, ask her. Did you notice anything else unusual?"</p><p>"Nothing."</p><p>"Didn't you see the smile on your wife's face when she walked over to the window? She smiled and didn't get irritated over the spilled coffee."</p><p>"I did notice that. She must have seen something good out the window that cheered her up."</p><p>"All she saw out the window was rain. Rain, which she never liked."</p><p>"So why did she smile?"</p><p>"I looked at your wife with my ray, too, and warmed her."</p><p>"You mean your ray warmed her and mine, what, is cold?"</p><p>"You just looked out of interest. You didn't invest your feelings."</p><p>"You mean your ray can warm someone at a distance?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"What else?"</p><p>"Receive and transmit certain information. The ray can improve someone's mood and partially drive out a person's pains. And lots of other different things depending on the energy I have and the strength of my feelings, will, and desire."</p><p>"And can you see the future?"</p><p>"Naturally!"</p><p>"The past?"</p><p>"The future and past are practically the same thing. The difference is just in the outward details. The main thing remains unchanged always."</p><p>"How is that? What can be unchanged?"</p><p>"For instance, a thousand years ago people wore different clothing. They used other devices in their daily life. But that isn't the main thing. A thousand years ago, like now, people had identical emotions. Those are not subject to time.</p><p>"Fear, joy, love. Imagine, Yaroslav the Wise, Ivan the Terrible, or a pharaoh could love a woman with exactly the same emotions as you or someone else does today."</p><p>"Interesting. Only I don't understand what this means. You say every person could have a ray like that?"</p><p>"Naturally. Even now people still have emotions and intuition, the ability to dream awake, to conjecture, to model individual situations, to dream asleep, only it's all chaotic and uncontrolled."</p><p>"Maybe we need to train somehow? Develop exercises?"</p><p>"You can if you train. Only, you know, Vladimir, there is one more indispensable condition for the ray to be subject to your will."</p><p>"What condition is that?"</p><p>"Purity of intentions is indispensable, and the ray's power depends on the power of the emotions of light."</p><p>"There you go! It's all coming clear, I think. But what does purity of intentions have to do with it? And emotions of light?"</p><p>"They are the ray's energy."</p><p>"That's it, Anastasia. This has ceased to be interesting. After this you'll add on something else."</p><p>"I've already told you the main part."</p><p>"Oh yes, you have, but there are too many conditions. Let's talk about something else. Something a little simpler."</p><p><div class=section>* * *</div></p><p> </p><p>Anastasia fills her day contemplating and modeling all kinds of situations going on in our past, present, and future life.</p><p>Anastasia has a prodigious memory. She remembers the many people she has seen in her imaginings or with her ray, as well as their inner struggles. Like a brilliant actress, she can imitate their walk and voice and think the way they do. She distills in herself the life experience of many people from the past and present. She uses this experience to model the future and help others. She does this at a great distance, with the help of her invisible ray, and those to whom she renders aid in the form of suggestions and decisions or whom she heals never suspect.</p><p>Only later did I learn that these rays, invisible to ordinary sight, come from each person, only with varying strengths. Academician Akimov photographed them using special devices and published the photographs of these rays in 1996, in the May issue of Miracles and Adventures. Unfortunately, we cannot use them as she can. Science calls something like this ray a "torsion field."</p><p> </p><p><div class=section>* * *</div></p><p> </p><p>Anastasia's worldview is unusual and interesting.</p><p>"What is God, Anastasia? Is there a God? If so, why can no one see Him?"</p><p>"God is interplanetary Reason, Intellect. He is not a unified mass. Half of Him is in the extramaterial world of the Universe. This is the set of all energies. The second half of Him is diffused as small particles on Earth, in each person. The forces of darkness try to block these particles."</p><p>"What do you think is in store for our society?"</p><p>"In the future, an awareness of the true perniciousnous of the technocratic path of development and a movement back to the primary sources."</p><p>"Do you mean to say that all our scientists are underdeveloped beings who are leading us into an impasse?"</p><p>"I mean to say that through them the process is accelerating, and that means so is our awareness of the wrong path."</p><p>"Which means what? Are we building all our cars and houses for nothing?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Don't you get bored living here alone, Anastasia? Alone, without a television or telephone?"</p><p>"What primitive things you've named. Man had all of that from the very beginning, only in a more perfect form. I have it, too."</p><p>"A television and a telephone?"</p><p>"What is a television? A device that offers information and pictures and draws up stories for the almost atrophied human imagination. With my imagination I can draw any subject, any picture, and construct the most incredible situations, and not only that but take part in them myself and have an effect on the story. Oh, I must not have expressed myself clearly. Right?"</p><p>"And the telephone?"</p><p>"A man can speak to another man without a telephone. All it takes is the will, the desire of both, and a developed imagination."</p>

<p>I suggested she come to Moscow and appear on television.</p><p>"Imagine, Anastasia. With your beauty you could be a photo model, or a world-class runway model."</p><p>This was when I realized that earthly things were not alien to her and, like any woman, she liked being a beauty. Anastasia started to laugh.</p><p>"The most beautiful of all, right?" she repeated and, like a child, she started playing the fool and prancing across the glade like a model down a runway.</p><p>She was funny imitating a model, putting one foot in front of the other as she walked and displaying her imaginary garments.</p><p>I started applauding, and joining in on the game I announced, "And now, ladies and gentlemen, attention! Appearing before you is the gorgeous, unsurpassed gymnast and incomparable beauty, Anastasia!"</p><p>This announcement amused her even more. She ran to the middle of the glade and performed incredible somersaults, first forward, then backward, sideways, to the right, to the left, and then leaped very high. She grabbed a branch with one hand, swung a couple of times, and flung her body to another tree. After turning another somersault, she bowed coquettishly to my applause. Then she ran from the glade and hid behind the thick bushes. Smiling, Anastasia peeked out as if from the wings and impatiently awaited my next announcement. I remembered a video of some favorite songs done by popular singers. Sometimes at night in my cabin I would watch it.</p><p>After recalling this video, without even thinking about whether Anastasia would be able to portray anything, I announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, we now present the best soloists of the modern stage, who will perform their best compositions. If you would!"</p><p>Oh, how wrong I was not to trust in her abilities. What happened then was absolutely beyond belief. Having barely taken a step from her improvised wings, Anastasia began singing in the voice of Alla Pugacheva. No, she wasn't parodying the great singer or imitating her voice, she was singing, freely transmitting, not only her voice and melody but also her emotions.</p><p>However, there was something even more amazing. Anastasia accented individual words, adding something of her own. She added nuances to the song. And Alla Pugacheva's song, whose interpretation I thought could not be surpassed, evoked an entire spectrum of additional emotions and highlighted the images even more vividly, as in, for example, the following song, magnificently performed in all:</p><p> </p><p>Once there was an artist,</p><p>Who had a little house and his paints,</p><p>But he loved an actress</p><p>And this actress loved flowers.</p><p>He sold his house then,</p><p>He sold his paintings and paints</p><p>And with all his money bought</p><p>An ocean of flowers ...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anastasia put the stress on the word "paints."</p><p>She shouted the word in surprise and fear. Paints are what is most precious for an artist. Without them he cannot create. He has given up what is dearest to him for the sake of his beloved. Later, at the lyric, "far away the train bore her," she depicted the artist, the lover, watching the train pulling out, carrying his beloved away forever. She portrayed pain, despair, and anguish.</p><p>Shaken by all I had seen and heard, I did not applaud when the song ended. Anastasia bowed, waited for my applause, and when she did not hear it began a new song with even greater ardor. She performed all my favorite songs recorded on my cassette in order. And in her performance each song, which I had heard many times, was even more vivid and moving. After she had performed the last song, when she heard no applause, Anastasia went into her "wings." Shaken, I sat a little longer in silence, under this unusual impression.</p><p>Then I leapt up and began to clap and shout, "Well done, Anastasia! Bis! Bravo! All performers on stage!"</p><p>Anastasia came out cautiously and bowed. I kept shouting,</p><p>"Bis! Bravo!" I stamped my feet and clapped my hands.</p><p>She became very cheerful as well. She clapped and shouted, "Bis. Does that mean more?"</p><p>"Yes, more! More! And even more! You did so well, Anastasia! Better than they themselves! Even better than our stars!"</p><p>I fell silent and studied Anastasia closely. It occurred to me how multifaceted her soul was, if she could impart so much that was new, beautiful, and vivid to a seemingly ideal performance of songs.</p><p>She had fallen still as well and was watching me silently and questioningly.</p><p>Then I asked her, "Anastasia, do you have your own song? Could you perform something of your own that I've never heard before?"</p><p>"Yes, but my song doesn't have words. Will you like it?"</p><p>"Sing your song, please."</p><p>"All right."</p><p>And she began to sing her extraordinary song.</p><p>First Anastasia cried out like a newborn child. Then her voice became soft, gentle and kind.</p><p>She stood under a tree, her hands pressed to her breast, head bowed, as if she were singing a lullaby and caressing the baby with her voice. Her voice was saying something gentle to him. And this quiet but amazingly pure voice made everything all around—the birds singing and the insects chirring in the grass—suddenly fall silent.</p><p>Then Anastasia seemed to be rejoicing at a child just awakened. There was exultation in her voice. Incredibly high notes first hovered above the earth and then soared into infinity.</p><p>Anastasia's voice implored someone, then entered into battle, then once again caressed the child and gave joy to everything around her.</p><p>Joy settled in me as well.</p><p>When she had finished her song, I shouted merrily, "And now, my esteemed ladies, gentlemen, and friends, a unique, unrepeatable act by the first and foremost trainer in the world! Deft, bold, and fascinating and capable of taming any predator. Watch and thrill!"</p><p>Anastasia actually squealed with delight, jumped up, clapped rhythmically, shouted something, and gave a whistle. Something unimaginable began in the glade.</p><p>The wolf cub appeared first. It jumped out of the bushes, stopped at the edge of the glade, and looked around, perplexed. Squirrels were racing through the trees that surrounded the glade, jumping from branch to branch. Two eagles circled low and little creatures rustled in the bushes.</p><p>There was a crack of dry branches—and a huge bear ran into the glade, after moving aside and trampling the bushes, stopping dead in its tracks close to Anastasia. The wolf cub growled at it in disapproval. Evidently the bear had come too close to Anastasia without an invitation.</p><p>Anastasia ran up to the bear, playfully slapped its snout, grabbed its front paws, and brought it to a standing position. She seemed to have exerted no significant physical effort in doing so, and the bear itself carried out her instructions, as best it understood them. It stood there frozen, trying to understand what she wanted of it.</p><p>Anastasia took a running start, leapt high, grabbed the bear's thick mane, did a handstand, and jumped down again, turning a somersault in the air. Then she took the bear by the paw and started leaning over, pulling the bear along and creating the impression of throwing him over her shoulder. This trick would have been impossible if the bear hadn't done it itself and Anastasia hadn't merely directed him. The bear started to fall on Anastasia but at the last moment put its weight on its palm on the ground and probably did everything possible not to inflict harm on its mistress or friend.</p><p>The wolf cub was getting more and more upset. It could no longer stand still and started rushing from side to side, either growling or snarling. A few more wolves appeared at the edge of the glade, and when Anastasia "threw" the bear over her shoulder one more time, trying to do it so that it also turned over her head, the bear fell on its side and stopped moving.</p><p>The utterly distraught wolf cub, baring its teeth maliciously, took a leap in the bear's direction.</p><p>In a flash Anastasia was in the wolf cub's path, and the cub, braking on all four paws, tumbled over and struck Anastasia's leg. Immediately she put one hand on the shoulder of the cub, which obediently flattened itself to the ground. With her second hand Anastasia waved, as she had with me when I first had wanted to embrace her without her consent.</p><p>The forest around us was making aroused, though not threatening noises. You could feel its arousal in the jumping, running, and hiding beasts, big and small. Anastasia began to instill calm. First she petted the wolf cub, slapped it on the shoulder, and sent it off with a spank, like a dog. The bear lay on its side in an awkward pose, like a scarecrow. It was probably waiting for something else to be asked of it. Anastasia went up to it, made it rise, stroked its snout, and, like the wolf cub, sent it packing.</p><p>Flushed and cheerful, Anastasia ran up and sat next to me, took a deep breath, and slowly exhaled. I noticed that her breathing immediately became even, as if she had not just performed her incredible exercises.</p><p>"They don't understand acting, and they don't need to. It's not entirely a good thing," Anastasia commented, and she asked me, "Well, how was I? Could I ever get a job in your life?"</p><p>"You were great, Anastasia, but we already have all that. Trainers in circuses show lots of interesting things with beasts. You would never break in, past the barrier of officials and all the conventions and intrigues. You're not well versed in them."</p><p>After this our game consisted of sifting through her options: where Anastasia might get a job in our world and how she might overcome the existing conventions. But no easy options were found, since Anastasia had no documents about her education, or residence permit, and no one would believe the stories about her background just on the basis of her abilities, however unusual.</p><p>Shifting to a serious note, Anastasia said, "Naturally I would like to spend time again in one of the cities, Moscow maybe, to see how accurate I've been in modeling certain situations from your life. For instance, I don't quite understand how the forces of darkness have managed to fool women to such a degree that, without even suspecting it themselves, they attract men with the charms of their body and so cannot make a true choice, a soul mate. Afterward they're the ones who suffer. They can't create a true family because ..."</p><p>She launched back into a stunning and demanding discourse on sex, the family, and childrearing, and I thought, "What is most unlikely out of everything I've seen and heard is her ability to speak about our life and know it so accurately and in such detail."</p>

</div>
<p>The second night, afraid that Anastasia would slip her bear in to keep me warm or cook up something else, I categorically refused to go to bed at all if she herself did not lie down next to me. I thought, "If she's next to me, she won't be up to anything." And I said, "This is what you call inviting me to be your guest. To your home. I thought there'd be some kind of structure here, but you won't even let me build a fire and you slip wild animals in with me at night. If you don't have a normal house, then you shouldn't be inviting guests."</p><p>"All right, Vladimir, don't get upset, please, and don't be afraid. Nothing bad is going to happen to you. If you like, I'll lie next to you and keep you warm."</p><p>This time there were even more cedar branches and dried, neatly laid grass thrown in the dugout lair, and the walls were stuck with twigs as well.</p><p>I got undressed, put my pants and sweater under my head, lay down, and covered up with my jacket. The cedar branches gave off that very same volatile fragrance which the popular scientific literature says decontaminates the air, although in the taiga the air is quite pure and easy to breathe as is. The dry grass and flowers added another extraordinarily subtle fragrance.</p><p>Anastasia kept her word and lay down next to me. The fragrance of her body surpassed all the others. It was more pleasant than the most refined perfumes whose fragrance I had ever smelled on any woman. Her body also gave off an unusually pleasant warmth that seemed to wrap around her body like a halo, and when I moved closer to her it wrapped around my body as well. It was as if Anastasia and I were inside an invisible but tangible sphere or cocoon. I may have been wrapped in an invisible aura. It was cozy and peaceful next to Anastasia. But now I had no thought of taking her, as I had the first day we met. I recalled how at our halt, during my attempt to kiss Anastasia, I had suddenly been flooded with fear and had lost consciousness. Since that incident I had had no carnal desires, even when I'd seen her naked.</p><p>I lay there dreaming about the son my wife had not borne me. I thought, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if I had a son by Anastasia! She's so healthy, hardy, and beautiful. That means the child would be healthy, too. And look like me. And maybe like her, too, but I'd rather more like me. He would be a strong and intelligent individual. He would know a lot. He would be talented and happy."</p><p>I pictured my baby son clinging to her nipples and unconsciously laid my hand on Anastasia's firm and warm breast.</p><p>Immediately a shudder ran right through my body—not a shudder of fear, but another kind, unusually pleasant. I did not pull my hand away but merely held my breath and waited for what would happen next. And then I felt her soft palm lying on my hand. She had not pushed me away.</p><p>I raised up and began looking at Anastasia's beautiful face. The white northern night made her even more attractive. I could not tear my eyes away.</p><p>Her gray-blue eyes were watching me tenderly.</p><p>I couldn't help myself. I leaned over and lightly touched and then cautiously kissed her parted lips.</p><p>Another pleasant shudder ran through my body. My face was enveloped by the fragrance of her breathing.</p><p>Her lips did not utter, as they had the last time, "Never mind, Vladimir, calm yourself," and there was no fear at all. Thoughts of a son would not leave me. When Anastasia gently embraced me, stroked my hair, and yielded her entire body to me, I felt something incredible! . . .</p><p>Only after I awoke in the morning was I conscious of a magnificent sensation, a blissful delight and satisfaction such as I had never once experienced in my life.</p><p>What was also strange was that usually after spending a night with a woman I've felt a physical weariness. Here it was entirely different, and I had the sense of some great creation.</p><p>The satisfaction was not only physical but also somehow incomprehensible, previously unheard of, unusually beautiful and joyous. The thought even occurred to me that only this feeling made life worth living. Why had I never experienced anything even closely resembling this, even though I had been with all kinds of women—beautiful, beloved, and experienced in love?</p><p>Anastasia was a young woman, a timid and tender young woman, but at the same time she had something inside her unlike any of the women I had known. What? Where was she now? I moved toward the access to our cozy lair, poked my nose out, and looked at the glade.</p><p>The glade was slightly lower than my night's abode. It was covered with a half-meter layer of morning fog.</p><p>In this fog, her arms flung wide, Anastasia was spinning.</p><p>She raised a small cloud of fog around herself, and when it had wrapped her up entirely, Anastasia took a light leap, extending her legs in a split like a ballerina, flew above the layer of fog, dropped to a new spot, and once again, laughing, spun a new cloud around herself through which the rays of the rising Sun shone, caressing her. This scene enchanted and enraptured me, and from an excess of emotion I shouted, "Ana-sta-si-a! Good morning, beautiful forest fairy Anastas-i-a!"</p><p>"Good morning, Vladimir," she shouted gaily in reply. "It's so fine, so beautiful right now!"</p><p>"Why is that?" I shouted as loudly as I could.</p><p>Anastasia raised her arms toward the Sun and laughed her happy, alluring laugh, shouting her answer to me and someone else above in a singsong.</p><p>"Only man of all the creatures in the Universe can experience this!</p><p>"Only a man and a woman sincerely desiring to have a child from each other!</p><p>"Only someone who has experienced this lights a star in the sky!</p><p>"Only someone aspiring to create and build!</p><p>"Tha-a-ank you-ou-ou!"</p><p>Turning only to me, she added, "Only someone aspiring to create and build, not to satisfy his own carnal needs."</p><p>Once again she laughed her rippling laugh, leapt high, and stretched into a split, as if soaring over the fog. Then she ran up, sat down beside me at the entrance to our night's abode, and started combing her fingers through her golden hair, lifting it up from below.</p><p>"You mean you don't consider sex something sinful?" I asked.</p><p>Anastasia froze. She looked at me in amazement and replied, "Was that the sex your world means by that word? If not, then what is more sinful: giving yourself so that a person can come into this world, or refraining and not letting a person be born? A real, live person!"</p><p>I gave that some thought. Indeed, you could not use the usual word "sex" for my night's intimacy with Anastasia. So what had happened in the night? What word applied here?</p><p>Once again I asked, "Why is it that I have never known anything even resembling this before? I don't think many others have either."</p><p>"Understand, Vladimir, the forces of darkness are trying to develop base, carnal passions in man in order to keep him from experiencing God-given grace. They try every possible way to suggest that satisfaction is easily come by, thinking only about carnal satisfaction, and by doing this they lead man away from the truth.</p><p>"Poor deceived women who don't know this accept nothing but suffering their entire life, spend their entire life searching for that lost grace. They're looking in the wrong place.</p><p>"No woman can keep a man from straying if she surrenders to him for the sake of satisfying merely carnal needs. If that's what happens, their life together can't be happy.</p><p>"Their life together is an illusion of togetherness, a lie, a conventionally accepted deceit. For the woman herself immediately becomes a whore, regardless of whether she is married to this man.</p><p>"Oh, how many laws and conventions has humanity devised to artificially reinforce this false union—laws spiritual and secular—all in vain. They merely force man to play-act, to adapt to them and only feign their union. Inner thoughts have always been immutable and not subject to anyone or anything.</p><p>"Jesus Christ saw that. And trying to counter this, he said, 'Whosoever looks on a woman with desire has already committed adultery with her in his heart.'</p><p>"Then you, in your near future, tried to brand the man who abandons his family with disgrace. But nothing, no time or situation, has ever kept man's desire from seeking intuitively felt grace and great satisfaction—no matter what.</p><p>"A false union is a terrible thing.</p><p>"The children! Understand, Vladimir. The children! They sense the artificiality and falseness of that kind of union, and they come to doubt everything their parents say. The children subconsciously sense the lie in their conception, and this makes them feel bad.</p><p>"Tell me, what person would want to come into the world as a result of merely carnal pleasures? Every person would like to have been created in a great surge of love, the desire to create, not come into the world as the result of carnal pleasures.</p><p>"Those who enter into a false union will later seek true satisfaction in secret from each other. They'll take more and more new bodies or use just their own bodies in a trivial and doomed way, aware only intuitively that the true grace of a true union keeps slipping away."</p><p>"Anastasia, wait a minute. Are man and woman really so doomed if the first time they just have sex? Is there really no recourse, no possibility of correcting their situation?"</p><p>"There is. Now I know what to do. But what words can I find and where? I keep searching for those words. I've searched in the past and future, but haven't found them. Could they be near at hand? New words are just about to appear, to be born, words capable of reaching hearts and minds—new words about the ancient truth of the primary sources."</p><p>"You mustn't get so upset, Anastasia. For now say it approximately, in the words you do have. What else is needed for true satisfaction besides two bodies?"</p><p>"Awareness! A mutual aspiration to create. Sincerity and purity of aspiration."</p><p>"How do you know all this, Anastasia?"</p><p>"I'm not the only one who knows about this. The enlightened Veles, Krishna, Rama, Shiva, Christ, Mohammad, and Buddha tried to explain the essence of this to people."</p><p>"You're telling me you've read about them? Where? When?"</p><p>"I haven't read about them, I just know what they said, thought about, and wanted."</p><p>"You mean you think just sex is bad?"</p><p>"Very bad. It leads man away from the truth and destroys families. A tremendous amount of energy escapes into nowhere."</p><p>"Then why are so many different magazines published with naked women in erotic poses and erotic films with sex? All this is very popular. Demand engenders supply. Do you mean to say that our humanity is completely bad?"</p><p>"Humanity isn't bad, but the mechanism of the dark forces, which eclipses spirituality and arouses base carnal desire, is very powerful. It brings many calamities and much suffering down on people. It operates through women by exploiting their beauty, a beauty that should engender and support the spirit of poet, artist, and creator in the man. But for this, the woman herself must be pure. If she lacks sufficient purity, she will try to attract a man with the charms of her flesh, the outward beauty of an empty vessel. Thus, she deceives him, and for this deceit she herself will inevitably suffer her whole life."</p><p>"So what happens then? Through the millennia of its existence, has humanity been powerless to fight these dark forces? Then they must be more powerful than man. Humanity could not fight them, despite the summons from the spiritual and enlightened, as you say? Does this mean they simply cannot be fought? And must they?"</p><p>"They must, without fail!"</p><p>"Who can do this?"</p><p>"Women! Women who have managed to understand the truth and their purpose. Then the men will change, too."</p><p>"Hardly, Anastasia. A normal man will always be aroused by a woman's beautiful legs and breasts, especially when you find yourself traveling or vacationing far from your girlfriend. That's how it is. No one here can change anything or make it different."</p><p>"But I did it with you."</p><p>"What did you do?"</p><p>"Now you won't be able to have this pernicious sex."</p><p>The terrible thought struck me like a shock and began to drive out the beautiful feeling born in the night.</p><p>"What did you do, Anastasia? What? Now I ... I ... what, now I'm ... impotent?"</p><p>"On the contrary, now you've become a real man. Only you'll find ordinary sex repugnant. It won't bring you what you experienced, and what you experienced is now possible only if you wish to have a child and if the woman wants the same from you. If she loves you."</p><p>"Loves me? But under those conditions . . . It might happen only a few times in my whole life."</p><p>"That's enough for you to be happy your whole life, I assure you, Vladimir. You'll understand. You'll feel it later.</p><p>"People enter into contact with just the flesh, and many times, and they don't know that no one can know true satisfaction just through their flesh.</p><p>"A man and a woman experience great satisfaction when they have united on all levels of being, in a rush of inspiration from the forces of light and aspiring to create. The Creator only gave it to man to know this. This satisfaction is not fleeting and cannot be compared with the carnal kind. You retain the sensations from it for a long time, and all planes of being make you and the woman happy—a woman capable of giving birth to a creation in the image and likeness of the Creator!"</p><p>Anastasia held out her hand to me and tried to move closer. I quickly jumped away from her, to the corner of the dugout, and shouted, "Stand clear of the exit!"</p><p>She stood up. I crawled outside. Anastasia was standing in front of me, and there was no blame in her gaze. I took several steps back from her and said harshly, "You may have deprived me of the greatest pleasure in life. Everyone strives for it, everyone thinks about it, only they don't talk about it out loud."</p><p>"It's an illusion, these pleasures, Vladimir. I helped you rid yourself of this terrible, pernicious, and sinful impulse."</p><p>"Illusion or not, it doesn't matter. It is a universally recognized pleasure. Don't think of depriving me of other impulses you think are pernicious. Otherwise, I'll get out of here and won't want to be with women, have a drink, eat, or smoke! That's not the usual for the majority in normal life."</p><p>"Well, what's so good about drinking, smoking, and the senseless and pernicious digestion of such a huge quantity of animal flesh if so many marvelous plants have been created especially to feed man?"</p><p>"You go feed on your plants if you like them, but don't go meddling with me. Many of us take pleasure in smoking and drinking and dining well. That's how we do things, understand? That's how we do things!"</p><p>"But everything you've named is bad and pernicious."</p><p>"Bad? Pernicious? But this is precisely how most of my friends and acquaintances live. If guests come to my house for a special occasion, they sit down at the table, and I tell them, 'Here, enjoy the nuts, eat a nice apple, drink some vodka, and don't smoke. Then you would feel terrible.'"</p><p>"You mean, when you gather with friends, you mainly sit down at the table immediately and drink, eat, and smoke?"</p><p>"Whether or not it's the main thing doesn't matter. This is the usual way all over the world for all people. In some countries even there are ritual dishes, roast turkey, for example."</p><p>"Not all the people even in your world do this."</p><p>"Maybe not all, but I live among normal people."</p><p>"Why do you think the people around you are the most normal?"</p><p>"Because they are the majority."</p><p>"That is not a good argument."</p><p>"It's not for you because it can't be explained to you."</p><p>My anger at Anastasia was starting to pass. I remembered what I'd heard about medicines and physician specialists and I thought, "If she's harmed me somehow, the doctors will be able to correct the situation." I said, "All right, Anastasia, let's come to an agreement. I'm not angry at you anymore. Thank you for a marvelous night. Only you have got to stop trying to rid me of my habits.</p><p>"I'll fix the sex problem with our doctors and modern medicines. Let's go for a swim."</p><p>I headed for the lake, admiring the morning forest. My good mood had started to return when she started in again! She was walking behind me and saying, "Your medicines and doctors won't help you now. To restore everything that was, they would have to wipe what happened and what you'd felt from your memory."</p><p>Taken aback, I stopped. "Then you have to restore it all."</p><p>"I can't either."</p><p>Once again, furious rage and fear overpowered me simultaneously.</p><p>"You . . . You really are brazen! You're interfering and spoiling my life. You mean you can do vile things but I can't fix them?"</p><p>"I haven't done anything vile. You wanted a son so much. But quite a few years have passed, and you don't have a son. And no woman in your life could bear you a son. I wanted a child from you, too, and a son, too, and I can. So why are you thinking the worst in advance, that things will be bad for you? You might understand yet. Please don't be afraid of me, Vladimir. I am absolutely not meddling in your psyche. It happened all by itself. Largely at your will. You got what you wanted.</p><p>"I wanted so badly to rid you of at least one mortal sin."</p><p>"Which is that?"</p><p>"Pride."</p><p>"You're an odd one. Your philosophy and way of life aren't human."</p><p>"What about me is so not human that it scares you?"</p><p>"You live alone in the forest and communicate with plants and beasts. No one lives even close to the way you do."</p><p>"Why do you think that is, Vladimir?" Anastasia began agitatedly. "The summer people communicate with plants and animals, too, though not consciously yet. But later they'll understand. Many are already beginning to understand."</p><p>"That's just great! She's a summer person. And this ray of yours. You don't read books, but you know a lot. It's some kind of hocus-pocus."</p><p>"I'll explain it all to you, Vladimir, only not all at once. I'm trying, but I can't seem to find the right words, understandable words. Please believe me, everything I do is inherent in man. He was given it from the very beginning, from the primary sources. Each person could do this. People will return to the primary sources anyway. This will happen gradually, when the forces of light are victorious."</p><p>"And your concert? You sang all the voices and depicted my favorite singers, and even in the order on my video."</p><p>"This is how it happened, Vladimir. I once saw that video. I'll tell you later how that came to be."</p><p>"So you just remembered the words and tunes of all the songs at once?"</p><p>"Yes. What's so difficult or mystical about that? Oh, what have I said! I was showing off! I frightened you! I'm doubtless incoherent and impetuous. My grandfather called me that once. I thought he said it out of love. But doubtless I truly am impetuous. Please. . . . Vladimir. . . ."</p><p>Anastasia spoke in a humanly agitated way, and probably for that reason my fear of her almost abated. The thought of a son occupied all my emotions.</p><p>"Oh, I'm not afraid anymore, just restrain yourself a little more. Your grandfather used to tell you that, too."</p><p>"Yes. My grandfather. But I keep talking and talking. I want so badly to tell you everything. I'm a blabbermouth, aren't I? Right? But I'll try. I'll try very hard to restrain myself. I'll try to say only what's understandable."</p><p>"Does this mean you'll give birth soon, Anastasia?"</p><p>"Naturally! Only not in time."</p><p>"What do you mean not in time?"</p><p>"I should in the summer, when nature would help me nurse it."</p><p>"Then why did you decide to go ahead if it's so risky for you and the child?"</p><p>"Don't worry, Vladimir, your son will live, at least."</p><p>"And you?"</p><p>"I will try to hold out until spring, and then everything will fall into place."</p><p>Anastasia said this without a shadow of sadness or fear for her life, and then she took a running start and leapt into the small lake. Splashes of water sparkling in the sun flew up like fireworks and dropped into the lake's pure smoothness. About thirty seconds later her body slowly began to surface. She lay on the water smiling, her arms flung to either side and her palms facing up.</p><p>I stood on shore looking at her and thinking, "Will the squirrel hear her snap her fingers when she's lying with the baby in one of her shelters? Will any of her four-legged friends help her? Will her body's warmth be enough to warm the little one?"</p><p>"If my body grows cold and the child has nothing to eat, he will cry," Anastasia said softly as she emerged from the water. "His angry cry may arouse pre-Spring nature or some of it, and then it will all be fine. They will nurse him."</p><p>"You were reading my thoughts?"</p><p>"No, I assumed that was what you were thinking. It's natural."</p><p>"Anastasia, you said your relatives live in neighboring areas. Could they help you?"</p><p>"They're very busy and cannot be torn away from their affairs."</p><p>"What are they busy with, Anastasia? What do you do for days on end, if you're basically fully served by nature?"</p><p>"I have things to do. I try to help the people of your world whom you call summer people or gardeners."</p>

<h2>10. Her Beloved Summer People</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>
<p>Anastasia waxed enthusiastic about the opportunities people have who communicate with plants. In general, Anastasia spoke with special awe, fervor, and absolute infatuation on two subjects: childrearing and summer people. If I told you everything she said about summer people and the significance she ascribed to them, you would have to get down on your knees before them. My goodness. She believed they'd saved everyone from starvation, were sowing good in people's souls, and were raising the society of the future. If I listed everything, I'd need a separate book. She also tried to prove and supply arguments in support of all this.</p><p>"You have to understand, the society you live in today can understand a lot by communicating with the plants being sown at dachas. It's at the dachas where you know every plant in your garden, not in the huge, impersonal fields that stupid monster machines crawl over. People feel better working at their dachas, and this has lengthened many people's lives. It makes them better, and it is the summer people who can help society understand just how pernicious the technocratic path is."</p><p>"Anastasia, whether or not that's true doesn't matter now. Where do you come in here? What does your assistance consist of?"</p><p>She grabbed my hand and pulled me onto the grass. We lay on our backs with our hands turned palms up.</p><p>"Close your eyes, relax, and try to picture what I'm going to say. Right now I'm going to use my ray to find, to see at a distance, one of those you call summer people.</p><p>She was silent for a while, then she began to speak softly.</p><p>"An elderly woman is unfolding a cheesecloth that cucumber seeds have been soaking in. The seeds have already sprouted and you can see little shoots. She's picked up one seed. And here I've hinted to her that she shouldn't soak the seeds like that because the shoots will be deformed when they're planted. That kind of water isn't quite right for nourishing them, and the seed will be sick. She thinks she has guessed this herself. And yes, that's partly true. I just gave her a little help. Now she's sharing her thoughts and telling other people about this. A small deed is done."</p><p>Anastasia told me how she modeled in her consciousness every possible kind of situation in work, rest, and interactions between people and between people and plants. When the situation she modeled came closest to the reality, contact was established, and she could see the person and sense what ailed him and what he was feeling. It was as though she entered into his image and shared her knowledge. Anastasia said that plants reacted to a person, could help him love or hate, and could have a positive or negative effect on his health.</p><p>"Here, too, I have a great deal of work. I'm busy with dacha gardens. The summer people go to their plots to see their plants as if they were their children, but unfortunately they're intuitive, their relations. They haven't yet been reinforced by a clear awareness of this connection's true purpose.</p><p>Everything on Earth—every blade of grass, every single bug—was created for man and has its task and purpose in serving man. The many medicinal plants confirm this. But a person of your world knows too little to make use of the opportunity he has been offered for his well-being—full use of it."</p><p>I asked Anastasia to show me by concrete example the benefit from conscious communication, so that I could verify it in practice, see it, and subject it to scientific study. Anastasia gave that a little thought. Suddenly her whole face beamed, and she exclaimed, "My summer people! My beloved summer people! They will prove everything and stump your science. How could I not have figured that out before? How could I not have understood?"</p><p>Some idea born in her had brought her tumultuous joy.</p><p>I never once saw Anastasia sad. She could be serious, thoughtful, and focused, but more often she was rejoicing in something. This time she was riotously joyous. She leapt up and clapped her hands, and the forest seemed to grow brighter. The forest stirred and responded to her with rustling treetops and the voices of birds.</p><p>She was spinning, as if in a dance. Then, beaming, she sat back down beside me and said, "Now they'll believe it! And these are my dear summer people. The will explain and prove everything to you."</p><p>I tried to return her as quickly as possible to our interrupted conversation and remarked, "That's not at all necessary. You declare that every bug was created for the good of man, but how are people to believe this who look with disgust at cockroaches crawling across kitchen tables? Are they created for our good, too?"</p><p>"Cockroaches only crawl across a dirty table," Anastasia replied, "to collect the remains of decaying pieces of food that are sometimes invisible to the eye, digest them, and then deposit the harmless waste in a secluded place. If you get a lot of them, bring a frog into the house, and the excess ones will leave immediately."</p><p>Anastasia went on to suggest that what summer people do probably contradicts the science of horticulture and without a doubt contradicts the usual rules for planting and growing various types of crops in vegetable plots. However, her assertions are so grandiose that I think everyone who has the opportunity should test them, maybe not in their entire garden, but in a small part of it, especially since it promises nothing but good. In addition, much of what she said has already been confirmed in experiments by the biologist N. M. Prokhorov.</p>

<h2>11. From the Advice of Anastasia</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>

<h3>The Seed Is a Doctor</h3>
<p>"Each seed you plant contains a huge amount of universal information," said Anastasia. "Nothing man-made can compare to it for size and accuracy. This information allows the seed to know precisely, down to the millisecond, when it needs to come to life and grow, what juices to take from the earth, and how to use the emanation from the Sun, the Moon, and the stars. It knows what to grow into and what fruits to bear.</p><p>"Fruits are intended to give man sustenance. These fruits can effectively fight and resist any illness of the human organism more powerfully than any man-made medicines that exist today or will in the future. But to do this, the seed has to know about the person's condition. In order for it to be saturated during the ripening process, the fruit needs the correlation of substances for healing a specific person and his illness, if he has one or a predisposition toward one.</p><p>"In order for the seed of a cucumber, tomato, or any other plant grown in a garden to have information about a person's health, the following is essential.</p><p>"Before planting, take one or several small seeds in your mouth and hold them under your tongue for at least nine minutes.</p><p>"Then put them between your palms and hold them like that for about thirty seconds.</p><p>"While holding the seeds between your palms, you must be standing barefoot on the plot of land where you will later plant.</p><p>"Open your palms, carefully lift the seed that lies in your hand toward your mouth, and blow the air from your lungs on the seed. You warm it with your breath, and the tiny seed gets to know what is inside you.</p><p>"After that, hold your palms open for thirty seconds, presenting the seed to the heavenly bodies. The seed will determine the instant of its ascent. All the planets will help it! And for you they will bestow on the shoots the light they need.</p><p>"Then you can plant the seed in the earth. In no case should you water immediately or you will wash your saliva and information off the whole seed, and the seed needs to take that in. Three days after planting you may water.</p><p>"The planting must be done on each vegetable's favorable days (man already knows this, according to the lunar calendar). Planting early without watering is not as terrible as planting late.</p><p>"You shouldn't remove all the weeds next to the shoot coming from your seed. You have to leave at least one of each kind. The weeds can be cut down."</p><p>In this way, according to Anastasia, the seed takes in information about the person, and while its fruit is growing, it will take from the Cosmos and Earth the maximum energy essential for this specific person.</p><p>You shouldn't remove all the weeds because they have their own purpose. Some protect the plants from disease; others provide additional information. During its growth, you must communicate with the plant. At least once during its growing period, preferably on the full moon, go up to it and touch it.</p><p>Anastasia said that fruits grown from a seed in this way and used by the person who grew them are capable of curing him of absolutely any disease of the flesh, significantly slowing the organism's aging, ridding him of harmful habits, increasing his intellectual abilities multifold, and giving him emotional peace.</p><p>The fruits will be most effective if they are used no more than three days after harvesting.</p><p>The above actions must be done with the various types of crops planted in the garden.</p><p>You do not have to sow the entire plot of cucumbers, tomatoes, and so on in this way. A few plants are sufficient.</p><p>Fruits raised by the method indicated will not only taste different from others. If they are subjected to analysis, the correlation of substances they contain will differ as well.</p><p>When planting seedlings in a scooped-out indentation, you absolutely must work the earth with your own hands and bare toes and spit in the indentation. When asked, "Why the feet?" Anastasia explained that substances (toxins, probably) containing information about the organism's illnesses are sweated out through the feet. The seedlings take in this information and convey it to the fruits, which will be capable of fighting the ailments. Anastasia advised walking through the garden barefoot from time to time.</p><h3>Which crops should be cultivated?</h3><p>Anastasia replied, "The variety in most gardens is sufficient: raspberries, currants, gooseberries, cucumbers, tomatoes, strawberries, and any apple. It's very good to have sweet or sour cherries and flowers. The number and plot size of these crops doesn't matter.</p><p>"The essential ones without which it's hard to offer a full-energy microclimate in a garden include plants like sunflowers (at least one). It is absolutely essential that you sow an area of one and a half to two square meters in grains—rye and wheat—and leave an island of at least two square meters for miscellaneous herbs. This island cannot be sown artificially; it has to be natural. If you don't have herbs preserved in your garden, you have to bring in sod from the forest to create that island."</p><p>I asked Anastasia if one had to plant the crops she classified directly in the garden, as she specified, if there were various herbs on the other side of the fence, not far from the plot.</p><p>"What matters is not only the variety of plants, but also how they are planted, the direct communication with them, through which the saturation of information occurs," she answered. "I already told you about the main method of planting. The important thing is to saturate the piece of nature that surrounds you with information about yourself. Only then will the healing effect and the life support for just your organism be significantly higher than from the fruits alone. In wild nature, as you call it—though it isn't wild, it's just unfamiliar to you—there are lots of plants you can use to heal absolutely every existing disease. That's why these plants were created, but man has lost or nearly lost the ability to determine them."</p><p>I told Anastasia we had many specialized pharmacies that sold healing herbs, and there were both doctors and simply healers who healed with herbs professionally, to which she replied, "The main doctor is your organism. From the very beginning, it was given the knowledge of which herb you should use and when, as well as how in general to feed yourself and breathe. It can avert illness even before its outward manifestation. And no one else can replace your organism, for this is the doctor God personally gave you and only you. I'm telling you how to give it the chance to act for your good.</p><p>"When you have established relationships with the plants in your garden they will heal and take care of you. They will independently give an exact diagnosis and manufacture the special medicine that is most effective for you specifically."</p><h3>Who Bees Sting</h3><p>"Every garden needs to have at least one bee family."</p><p>I told her that only a few of us could handle bees. People study in special schools for this, but even for them it didn't always work out.</p><p>But she replied, "Much of what you do for the bee family's life support gets in the way. In the last few thousand years only two people on earth have come a little closer to understanding this unique living mechanism."</p><p>"Who were they?"</p><p>"Two monks, and they have been made saints. You can read about them in your books, which are in monastery repositories."</p><p>"You mean you read church literature, Anastasia? Where and when? You don't have a single book."</p><p>"I use a more perfected method of obtaining information."</p><p>"What method? You're saying something incomprehensible again. You did promise no hocus-pocus or fantasy."</p><p>"I'll tell you about it, and I can try to teach you. Right now you won't understand, but it's simple and natural."</p><p>"All right, then, how should bees be kept in gardens?"</p><p>"You just have to make them a nest similar to what they have in natural conditions, and that's it. The only work beyond that might be to take some of the honey, wax, and other very beneficial substances the bees produce."</p><p>"Anastasia , that isn't simple at all. Who knows what this natural nest should be? If you had told me how to make it myself out of the materials we have on hand, then that would be doable."</p><p>"All right"—she laughed—"then you'll have to wait a little. I have to model it, you know, see what modern people might have on hand, as you say."</p><p>"And where to put it so as not to spoil the view?" I added.</p><p>"I'll try that as well."</p><p>She lay down on the grass, as she did every time she modeled her, or rather our, life situations, but this time I observed her carefully. Anastasia lay on the grass, her arms stretched out to the sides, palms up. Her fingers were curved, and their tips, or rather, the tips of the four fingers on each hand, were also facing pads up.</p><p>First her fingers moved the barest bit, then they stopped.</p><p>Her eyes were closed. Her body was completely relaxed. At first her face was relaxed as well, and then the barest shadow of some emotion or sensation passed across it.</p><p>Later she explained the accessibility of vision at a distance to anyone taught in a specific way.</p><p>But about the beehive Anastasia told me the following.</p><p>"You have to make a trough. You can use a log with a hollow, which you can enlarge, or make it out of boards of deciduous species. The boards should be at least six centimeters thick, the inner volume at least forty by forty centimeters, and the length at least one hundred twenty centimeters. Attach small triangular laths to the corners of the inner joints so that the corners are rounded. The laths can be glued on lightly; the bees themselves will secure them afterward. You can cover one butt end completely with a board of the same thickness and make the other end open. To do this, bend the board so that you can attach it after packing it with grass or a cloth. At the same time, cover the entire bottom with a cloth. All along the length of one of the joints, make a groove approximately one and a half centimeters deep. The grooves or single groove should stop thirty centimeters from the open butt end. This trough can be placed somewhere in the garden, on palings.</p><p>"The trough has to be at least twenty or twenty-five centimeters off the ground. Make the grooves face south. But it's even better to attach it under the roof of the house. Then man won't keep the bees from flying out, and they won't disturb him.</p><p>"The trough has to be attached horizontally at a twenty- to thirty-degree incline.</p><p>"The open butt end has to be on the bottom. You can put the trough in the attic, too, but then there has to be good ventilation.</p><p>"The best is to attach the trough to the south side right under the roof of the house or on the roof itself. You need only provide a way to get at the trough to remove some of the honey-filled combs.</p><p>"There should be an awning over the trough to keep the sun off and it should stand on a platform. You can heat it in winter."</p><p>I pointed out to Anastasia that this kind of trough would be so heavy that the tent and platform might spoil the look of the house. "What could we do in that case?" Slightly surprised, she looked at me and said, "The problem is that your beekeepers' methods aren't quite correct. My grandfather used to tell me. Modern beekeepers have invented all kinds of hive constructions, and all of them assume man's constant interference in the bees' nest. Beekeepers swap out the frames of combs, and in winter they drag the hives and bees to another spot, and you should never do that.</p><p>"Bees build their combs a strictly defined distance apart from one another. They themselves provide an entire system for ventilation and for fighting their enemies, and any interference damages this system. Instead of collecting the honey and raising new bees, they have to fix what was destroyed.</p><p>"In natural conditions, bees live in the hollows of trees and cope with all their own problems just fine. I've told you how to keep them in conditions closest to natural ones. The benefit from their presence is very great. They are the most effective at pollinating all the plants and they raise yield, but you must know that well.</p><p>"What you might not know is that bees, on top of everything else, use their proboscis to open up the channels in the plant for additional information reflected by the planets to enter—information the plant, and therefore man, needs."</p><p>"But bees sting people. What kind of rest at the dacha is it if a person lives in constant fear?"</p><p>"Bees sting when man treats them aggressively, waves his hands, becomes frightened, and feels very aggressive—toward anyone, not necessarily the bees. They sense that and don't absorb the emanations from any dark feelings. They can also sting parts of the body where there are endings leading to some organ of the person that's diseased and where the protective membrane has been broken and there is other damage.</p><p>"You know how effectively bees cure the illness you call radiculitis, but this is far from the only one they can cure.</p><p>"If I were tell you about all them, and also to prove it to you, the way you want me to, you would have to spend weeks with me, not a few days. You've heard a lot about bees, and I've just made a few corrections to that information. Please believe me: they're substantive. It's very simple to install a family in a hive like this. You have to pour the bee swarm into it, but first you have to put in a piece of wax and a bee-plant. You don't need any homemade frames or combs. Later, when the families are living in at least a few neighboring gardens, the bees themselves will multiply, and swarm, and they will occupy free troughs."</p><p>"But how do you collect the honey from them?"</p><p>"Open the butt-end cover, break off the hanging combs, and remove the sealed honey and pollen. Only don't be greedy. You have to leave some of it for the bees for the winter. And the first year it's better not to collect the honey at all."</p><h3>"Hello, Morning!”</h3><p>Anastasia adapted her morning routine to the conditions of a dacha garden.</p><p>"In the morning, preferably at sunrise, go out to the garden barefoot and walk up to whichever plants you feel like walking up to. You may touch them, not necessarily according to some template or ritual repeated strictly day in and day out, but however you feel, however you wish. However, you must do this before washing. Then the plants will smell the substances your body has discharged through the pores of your skin while you were asleep. If it's warm and there is at least a small patch of grass nearby—as there should be—you should lie down on it and stretch for a few minutes. If a bug crawls on your body, don't drive it off. Many bugs open up and cleanse the pores on the body. As a rule, they open up the pores toxins are discharged through, toxins that bring all kinds of internal ailments to the skin's surface, allowing the person to wipe them away. If there is some body of water on your land, plunge into it. If not, you can douse yourself with water. When you do, you must stand barefoot not far from the beds and plants—even better, between the beds, or for example, one morning next to the raspberry bushes, another the currants, and so on. Don't dry off after pouring the water. Shake drops of water off your hand as if you were showering them on the surrounding plants. You also need to fling drops of water off other parts of your body with your hands. After that, you can perform your normal ablutions and use the devices you're used to."</p><h3>Evening Routine</h3><p>"In the evening, before you go to bed, you should wash your feet, using water with a small quantity (a few drops) of orache or nettle juice added. You can use both together without soap or shampoo. Pour the water you use to wash your feet on the beds. After which, if there's any need, you may wash your feet with soap. This evening routine is important for two reasons. Toxins come out through the sweating of the feet, ridding the organism of internal diseases, and you have to wash them in order to cleanse the pores. Orache and nettle juice do this very well. By pouring the water out on the beds, you give additional information to the microorganisms and plants about your condition that day. This is very important, too. Only by receiving this information can the visible and invisible world around you produce--by taking it from the Cosmos and Earth--everything needed for the normal functioning of your organism."</p><h3>He Prepares Everything Himself</h3><p>I was also interested in learning what she would say about nourishment. After all, she herself ate in such an unusual way.</p><p>"Anastasia, tell me how you think man should nourish himself, what he should eat and when, how many times a day, and in what quantity. We have a lot of attention being paid to this question. There is a great deal of literature of all kinds, recipes for healthy eating, dieting advice."</p><p>"It's hard to imagine man's way of life in the conditions of the technocratic world any other way. The forces of darkness are constantly trying to replace the natural mechanism of this world, given to man in the beginning, with their unwieldy, artificial system, which contradicts human nature."</p><p>I asked Anastasia to speak more specifically and understandably, without her philosophical musings.</p><p>She continued. "You understand, your questions—what, when, and in what quantity man should eat—cannot be answered better than by each specific person's organism.</p><p>"Hunger and thirst were given us to signal to each person individually when he needs to consume food. That is the moment most favorable for each person.</p><p>"The technocratic world cannot give man the opportunity to satisfy his hunger and thirst at the moment his organism desired, and then it began to drive man into a template conditioned by his own helplessness, while also justifying it by a certain logic.</p><p>"Picture this. One person sits for half a day barely expending energy; another performs some physical labor or simply runs, pouring sweat, expending ten times more energy. Yet they are supposed to nourish themselves at the same time.</p><p>"Man should consume food the moment his organism advises him to, and there can be no other advisor. I understand that under your circumstances this is nearly impracticable, but people at their gardens, next to their dwellings, have that opportunity, and they should take advantage of it, tossing aside unnatural, artificial guidelines.</p><p>"I can say the same thing in reply to your question of what man should eat. The answer is what is at hand at the given moment. The organism itself selects what it needs. From what is nontraditional I can advise the following. If there is some kind of animal near your dwelling (a cat or dog), watch it carefully. From time to time it will pick some herb out of the many kinds and eat it. You should pick at least a few of these herbs and add them to your food. You don't have to do this every day. Once or twice a week is enough.</p><p>"You should also collect the grains yourself, pound and grind them, make flour, and bake bread. This is especially important. The person who consumes this bread just once or twice a year gains a store of energy and the ability to activate his inner psychic forces. It will have a positive effect on his physical condition and soothe his soul. You can give this bread to your relatives, the people closest to you, as well. It will also have a highly beneficial effect on them if you give it sincerely and with good intention.</p><p>"At least once a summer, for three days, it is very beneficial for each person's health to feed himself only with what grows in his garden, also consuming bread, sunflower oil, and a minimum of salt."</p><p>I've already told you how Anastasia fed herself. Even while she was telling her story, she would unconsciously pick one herb, and then another, chew it herself, and give it to me. I decided to try it, too. Its taste made no impression, but it wasn't revolting either.</p><p>The process of nourishing and sustaining the life of Anastasia's organism seemed to have been entrusted to nature and never interfered with her thoughts, which were engaged with other problems. Meanwhile, her health was an inalienable part of her extraordinary outward beauty.</p><p>According to Anastasia, the organism of someone who has established relations like this with the plant world and the earth of his garden can rid himself completely of all diseases.</p><p>In and of itself, disease is a fact of man's alienation from the natural mechanisms that are supposed to watch after his health and sustain his life. For them, for these mechanisms, fighting any illness presents no problem, for therein lies the essence of their existence. The benefit someone can derive—someone who has established informational contact by getting close to his small garden in the natural world—is significantly greater than fighting disease.</p>

<p>I've already spoken about how enthusiastic Anastasia would get talking about plants and the people who communicated with them. I thought that living in nature as she did, she had studied only nature well, but she possessed information on the planets as well. She seemed actually to feel the heavenly bodies. Judge for yourself how she spoke about sleeping under a starry sky.</p><p>"After receiving information about a specific person, the plants enter into an exchange of information with cosmic forces, but they are only intermediaries carrying out a narrow task affecting the flesh and a few spiritual planes. They never come in contact with the complex processes inherent to the human brain alone of all the planet's animal and plant world and inherent only on the human planes of being. However, the resulting information exchange allows man to do what he alone is capable of doing: benefit from the cosmic intellect, or, to be more precise, exchange information with it. The procedure, which is not at all complicated, makes it possible to create and feel the salutariness of this effect.</p><p>Anastasia explained it as follows.</p><p>"One evening, when weather conditions permit, plan to spend your night under a starry sky.</p><p>"You must make your bed not far from raspberry or currant bushes or plantings of grain.</p><p>"You must be alone.</p><p>"Lying in your bed facing the starry sky, don't close your eyes right away. Let your gaze and thoughts roam through the cosmic bodies. Don't tense up thinking about them. Your thoughts should be light and free.</p><p>"First, try to think about the heavenly bodies most visible to you. Then you can daydream a little about what is precious to you, the people close to you, those whom you wish good.</p><p>"Don't even try to think in that moment about revenge or wishing anyone ill. The effect could be harmful to you.</p><p>"This simple procedure will revive some of the many cells sleeping in your brain, most of which never do wake up during an entire human life.</p><p>"The cosmic forces will be with you and help you achieve your most inconceivable and brightest dreams, acquire spiritual peace, enjoy auspicious relations with the people close to you, and strengthen or evoke their love for you.</p><p>"It is very useful to perform this procedure several times. It is effective not only in places where you have continuous contact with the plant world. You will feel this in the morning yourself.</p><p>"It is especially important to perform this procedure on the eve of each of your birthdays. It would take a long time to explain right now how this works, and there would be no point. Some of the explanations you wouldn't believe, and some you wouldn't understand. It will be significantly easier and briefer to talk about this with those who have already tried it and experienced its effect, for the information obtained and verified will facilitate perception of what follows."</p>

</div>
<p>One night during my visit with Anastasia, I had occasion to see how she herself communicates with the stars.</p><p>The night before, Anastasia said, "Vladimir, the coming night is significant for me. I won't be able to sleep next to you. But don't worry. I can call on the wolf cub, and it will guard you and the entrance to the dugout while you're sleeping."</p><p>I had no desire to sleep alone in the dugout. The access to it could not be shut off, and any beast could come in and attack a sleeping person. The beasts protected Anastasia, but they might not like me if I was left alone. They might not even do anything bad to me, but the alarm and fear would keep me from falling asleep. I asked, "Anastasia, where will you be tonight?"</p><p>"I'll be in the water on the lake, Vladimir."</p><p>"You mean you'll be swimming. Do you really have to go for a swim tonight in particular?"</p><p>"Yes, Vladimir, there is only one night like this each year, and I mustn't miss it."</p><p>I didn't try to question her as to why she had to be in the lake this night in particular. I was more interested in how I was going to keep myself safe. So I suggested, "I could go to the lake with you. I could sit on the shore while you swim."</p><p>"All right, Vladimir. Only dress warmly and let's take dry grass so if you feel like it you can sleep on it."</p><p>And that is what we did. When it grew dark, I lay down on the dry grass and watched what happened.</p><p>The night was warm and still. The tree tops were not making noise, and there wasn't even any chirring in the grass or rustling from the taiga's nocturnal inhabitants. The many stars shone unusually brightly in the clear sky.</p><p>Anastasia stood on the shore of the lake and gazed silently at its smooth surface, where stars large and small were reflected as in a mirror. Then she removed her shift and walked into the lake naked. For a while she stood up to her knees in the water. Then she sat down and cautiously stroked the water with the palms of her hands. All of a sudden Anastasia dove into the starry scattering reflected in the water. She dove carefully, without disturbing the water in the least. Surfacing, she swam slowly in a circle. Gradually she reduced the diameter of her circles until she was exactly in the middle of the lake. There she turned on her back and lay on the water, facing the sky, her hands stretched out to the sides.</p><p>Because the heavenly stars were reflected in the lake's water, she seemed to be lying in the middle of a space filled with heavenly bodies on all sides, above and below, and she herself seemed to be a part of the starry assemblage.</p><p>The water in the lake pulsed with a soft, barely perceptible, varicolored light. The starry lake and the entire space around it cast a spell, and I fell asleep thinking of nothing.</p><p>I awoke at dawn, when the stars were no longer reflected in the lake. Anastasia was sitting next to me wearing her knitted shift, her arms clasping her knees and her head resting on them. She didn't stir.</p><p>Although it was very early morning, I couldn't fall back to sleep. I wanted to find out why she had performed that strange nocturnal procedure.</p><p>I moved toward Anastasia, and stroking her hand for some reason said, "Please don't take offense at what I'm going to say to you, Anastasia."</p><p>"Speak, Vladimir. I won't take offense."</p><p>"This night was very beautiful on the lake. I've never seen such beauty in my life or experienced such a pleasant sensation. It seemed as if the lake were in the middle of the universe, not the Siberian taiga. Only you shouldn't have been in the water so long, Anastasia. You have to take care of yourself now. I don't think you should be performing the kind of procedures you did last night. After all, the water is no longer warm enough for swimming and you might catch cold or something else bad might happen. You're with child and have to take care of yourself, especially since I see no point to this procedure or ritual."</p><p>"There is a point to what I did, Vladimir."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"My mama washed me with the water from this lake when I came into the world. Water is very, very important. It is present in all that lives and exists in the universe.</p><p>"The water of life holds all the information about the creation of life in the universe. It also holds all the thoughts and feelings man has ever produced. Water can also sense and react to human emotions."</p><p>"Perhaps that's so, Anastasia—I don't know—but why swim in the lake at night? What do you need that for?"</p><p>"I want to learn how people have lived from their very first appearance up until the present day, Vladimir, to determine when and at what moments and ages they were happiest, what brought them the greatest happiness. Then I want to tell the people of today about this, so that they can be happy, so that our children can be happy."</p><p>"But is it really possible to know the deeds of people who lived centuries ago?"</p><p>"Yes, Vladimir. When a child is born, as he grows up he comes to resemble his parents outwardly and not only outwardly, but he also resembles the first man. He has the same blood, and deep in his memory he retains all the information, starting from the creation, only he doesn't think about that information. If he tries, though, he can remember everything."</p><p>"Let's say he can, but these memories will be only about the ancestors of a specific person."</p><p>"Naturally, Vladimir—naturally only from his ancestors about their ancestors. The memory in my cells shows me scenes from the life of my, and only my, distant ancestors."</p><p>Anastasia jumped up, ran to the lake, and cautiously touched the water, then she turned toward me and continued.</p><p>"But the water knows about the past of all people. It has in it information about everyone and everything that has ever happened in the universe. And it is helping me see this. When I'm in the water in the middle of the lake and I think, it thinks with me and searches for the right scenes. It even scans everything happening on all the planets, because it is everywhere.</p><p>The stars are reflected in the lake, and the stars are reflected in my eyes, and at that moment we are one. All the information of the Universe becomes accessible to man, for at that moment he feels like a tiny part of the Universe. The Universe rejoices when man feels like a tiny part of it and is ready to serve him, to turn what man has contemplated into a reality."</p><p>I listened to Anastasia speaking with calm confidence about the universe, stars, and water, and I thought, "Here is a beautiful young woman living in the taiga, and she has none of the daily problems we do in our technocratic world. Maybe this is why her thoughts and notions about the universe are so unusual. She speaks with such confidence about her ideas of the world that I feel awkward talking to her about my doubts about her statements." Out loud I said, "Anastasia, you analyze the life of humanity as if you were a research scientist. What period of time have you been able to examine?"</p><p>"Very little so far, just nine millennia."</p><p>"Your very little is quite a lot. And what conclusions have you drawn from what you've seen?"</p><p>"I'll tell you about my conclusions later, Vladimir, or just show you the scenes I saw, and you and other people can draw your own conclusions."</p><p>"People can draw conclusions, of course, if they believe what you've said. For instance, you say unusual things about water, but where is the proof that water stores information and reacts to human emotions on top of that?"</p><p>"I think your contemporary scientists have it."</p><p>"If so, I haven't heard anything. We have a simple attitude toward water. It's just water, a tiny part of man's environment."</p><p>"Yes, a tiny part, a living part. Hardly anyone thinks of it as a living being. You ask for proof, even though the large part of your body consists of water.</p><p>"I can tell you about actions any person can use for himself to feel the great possibilities of living water, Vladimir."</p><p>"Tell me."</p><p>"You or those who want to experience water's healing properties must first find the spring with the water that tastes best to you.</p><p>"Bring that water home, pour it into vessels, and freeze it. Every evening put the amount of water you need for a day on the table in a handsome vessel, preferably with a piece of green fabric underneath the vessel.</p><p>"Before going to sleep, you have to say good words to the water, or you can just think tenderly about it.</p><p>"The room shouldn't be too warm because a little bit of ice should remain in the water. If it doesn't, you need to add a piece of the ice stored separately in the cold.</p><p>"It is good to add a small piece of the ice to warm water, too. And to the hot tea you drink.</p><p>"As the ice melts, it is good to think about the water with tenderness, and you can say nice words to it, as if it were a living being. You can put one drop of cedar oil into the melted water. No matter what volume of water this drop falls into, the information from it will spread throughout the water, and this information is very important.</p><p>"Before going to sleep, you can stroke the vessel of water and exhale the air from yourself onto the water.</p><p>"The next day, when you wake up, say good morning to the water. It's good to drink the water in small, unhurried sips.</p><p>"You can also wet your face with it.</p><p>"If you have any ailments in your body, the water will start to heal them and will definitely cure them. You will feel the improvement in three days.</p><p>"If you use the water for ninety-nine days, even serious diseases will leave your body, and you will see the skin on your face improve noticeably.</p><p>"If you want your body to be younger and your thinking to move more rapidly, then in addition to the water you can use cedar oil in the morning, at noon, and at nightfall, one sip each time, and also honey from various herbs and flower pollen in whatever quantity you find pleasing. But you mustn't mix them with the water. If you do this for thirty days, you will begin to think faster, and your body will be younger."</p><p>"Anastasia, what you have told me is worthy of attention because scientists and ordinary people alike can verify what you said. But how do you know all this? From your ancestors?"</p><p>"From the water," Anastasia said, and she began to laugh and spin, rejoicing at something. Then she stopped and added seriously, "I also know this from the stars."</p>

<h2>14. Your Child's Helper and Teacher</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>

<p>When I asked Anastasia how a plot of land with plants—even if they're planted in a special way and are in contact with man—could help raise children, I expected to hear an answer from her about how essential it was to instill a love of nature in children, but I was wrong. What she said amazed me with the simplicity of its argument and the profundity of its philosophical thought.</p><p>"Nature and the mind of the Universe made sure that each new person was born a sovereign, a king! He is like an angel, pure and immaculate. The still open seed receives a huge stream of information from the universe. Each newborn's abilities allow him to become the wisest being in the Universe, akin to God. It takes him very little time to bestow happiness and grace on his parents. He is conscious of the essence of the universe and the meaning of human existence for a span of just nine Earth years. And everything he needs for this already exists. Parents merely need not to distort the real natural universe or separate the child from the Universe's most perfect creations.</p><p>"But the technocratic world doesn't let parents do that.</p><p>"What does an infant see with his first conscious look? He sees a ceiling, the edge of his little bed, a few scraps of cloth, and walls—the attributes and values of an artificial world created by a technocratic society. And in this world is his mother, her breast. 'That means this is probably how it should be,' he thinks.</p><p>"His smiling parents bring him clattering, squeaking objects and toys as if they were something precious. Why? He will spend a long time trying to understand why they clatter and squeak.</p><p>"He will try to make sense of this consciously and subconsciously.</p><p>"Then these same smiling parents will tie him up in cloths, and he'll be uncomfortable. He'll try to free himself, but in vain! And his only way to protest will be to cry out! A cry of protest, a plea for help, a cry of indignation. At that moment the angel and sovereign becomes a beggar, a slave pleading for charity.</p><p>"The child is offered one attribute of the artificial world after another. As a treat—a new toy, new clothes. And in this way his parents will suggest that these objects represent what is most important in the world he has come into.</p><p>"Though he is still small, he is already the most perfect being in the Universe, but they will speak baby talk with him, treating him as if he were an imperfect being. Even in those institutions where you think teaching is going on, they will again speak to him of the virtues of the artificial world.</p><p>"Only as he nears nine will they mention in passing the existence of nature, as if it were an appendix to something else, to the main thing, by which they mean what is man-made.</p><p>"To the end of their days, most people are incapable of realizing the truth. You'd think it was a simple question: What is the meaning of life? Yet it remains unanswered.</p><p>"But the meaning of life lies in truth, joy, and love.</p><p>"A nine-year-old child raised by the natural world has more a more accurate awareness of the universe than the scientific institutions of your world and many scientists recognized by your society."</p><p>"Stop, Anastasia. You mean knowledge of nature probably?</p><p>"If his life is going to be spent like yours, then I can agree with you. But modern man is compelled—whether for good or ill is another question—but he is compelled to live in our technocratic world, as you call it.</p><p>"Someone raised the way you propose will know nature and will have a feel for it but will be a total ignoramus in the other. There are also sciences like mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and basic knowledge of life and its social phenomena."</p><p>"For someone who has once known the essence of the universe, all this is trivial. If he wants to, if he feels he needs to make a mark in some science, then he will easily surpass those who have not known the foundations of the universe."</p><p>"Why would that be?"</p><p>"The man of the technocratic world has yet to invent anything nature doesn't have. Even perfected man-made mechanisms are but a pathetic likeness of what already exists in nature."</p><p>"Fine, let's say that's true. You did promise to tell me how a child can be raised and his abilities developed in our conditions. Only speak understandably. Show me using specific examples."</p><p>"I'll try," Anastasia replied. "I've already modeled these situations and attempted to suggest to one family what needed to be done, but they just couldn't comprehend the key point and ask their child a question. These parents had an unusually pure and capable child. He could have brought much benefit to those living on Earth. But when the parents take their three-year-old child with them to their dacha plot they bring along his favorite toys, artificial toys that displace the Universe's true priorities.</p><p>"Oh, if only they didn't do that! After all, the child could be occupied and distracted by something else more interesting than the meaningless and even harmful contact with man-made objects.</p><p>"Above all, ask him to help you. But do this in all seriousness, especially since he really will help you.</p><p>"If you are planting, ask him to hold the seeds ready for planting, or hoe the bed, or put the seed in the prepared depression himself. While you're doing this, tell him what you are doing. For example, you can say, 'We are putting the seed in the earth and sprinkling it with earth. When the nice sun shines and warms the earth, the seed will warm up and start to grow. It will want to take a look at the nice sun so a green shoot will peek out of the earth, like this one.' Here you need to show him a blade of grass. 'If the shoot likes it, it will get bigger and bigger and may turn into a tree or something smaller, a flower. I also want it to give us tasty fruit, which you will eat if you like it. The shoot is preparing its fruit for you.'</p><p>"Each time you come to your garden with your child or he wakes up in the morning, the first thing you need to suggest to him is to go see if a shoot has appeared. If you see a new shoot, rejoice.</p><p>"When you plant a seedling instead of seeds, you must also explain to the child what you are doing. If you're transplanting tomato seedlings, let him bring you one stem at a time. If he breaks it by accident, take the broken stem in your hands and say, 'I don't think this one is going to live and bear us fruit. It's broken. But let's try to plant it anyway.' Plant at least one broken one among the others. In a few days, when you and your child go up to the bed again with the now started tomato plants, show your little one the broken one, too, the withering stem, and remind the child that it was broken during planting. Do not speak to the child in a condescending tone. Talk to him as your equal. You have to be aware that in some ways he surpasses you, for instance, in purity of intention. He is an angel. If you can understand that, you can act intuitively in the future, and your child truly will become a person who makes you happy.</p><p>"When you sleep under a starry sky, take your child with you, and lay him down beside you. Let him look at the starry sky. Don't explain the names of the planets, or how you understand their origin or destiny, for you yourself don't know that, and the dogma in your brain will only lead the child away from the truth. His subconscious knows the truth, and it will move into his conscious mind itself. You can only tell him that you like to look at the shining stars, and you can ask your child which star he likes best of all.</p><p>"Generally speaking, it is very important to know how to ask your child questions. The next year, you must offer your child his own planting bed and prepare it, giving him the chance to do everything in it he wants to. In no case should you force him to do something in it or correct what he has done. You can only ask him what he wants. You can help him out only after asking his permission to work with him. When you sow cereals, let him throw the grains on the bed with his own little hand."</p><p>"All right," I commented to Anastasia with suspicion. "Maybe this way the child will develop an interest in the plant world and may become a good farmer, but where is he going to get knowledge in other spheres?"</p><p>"What do you mean 'where'? The main thing is not just that he will know and feel what grows and how but that he will start to think and analyze and that the cells in his brain that will be working his entire life will wake up. They are what make him smarter and more talented than those in whom those cells are asleep.</p><p>"As for your being, what you call progress, it might be unsurpassed in any sphere, but the purity of his intentions will make him happiest of all. The contact he makes with his planets will allow him to receive more and more new information continuously and to exchange information. All this will be taken in by his subconscious and transferred to his conscious mind in the form of more and more new thoughts and discoveries. Outwardly he will be an ordinary person, but inwardly . . . You call people like that geniuses."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Anastasia, is this exactly how your parents raised you?"</p><p>She answered me after a brief pause, during which she was probably recalling her childhood. Then Anastasia sat down on the grass, stroked it with the palms of her hands and began.</p><p>"I barely remember my papa and mama in the flesh at all. I was raised by my grandfather and great-grandfather more or less the way I was just telling you, but the point is that I myself had a good feel for nature and the animal world around me, maybe without being fully aware of its entire purpose—but that's not the main thing when you have that feel.</p><p>"I continued to live in this glade without my papa and mama, but I wasn't alone.</p><p>"Around me in the grass there were lots of bugs and beetles of all kinds. I would put out my hand to them, they would jump and crawl over them, and I would examine them and think about why they were all so different. So they would be fun for me to play with or for some other reason?</p><p>"I liked the larger beasts, too. I had an interesting time with them, especially when I learned not just to walk but to run, too.</p><p>"I made friends with a wolf cub, a she-bear, and a fox. They were my friends, but sometimes we fought.</p><p>"I very much wanted to understand their language and thoughts because I wanted to understand why none of them would let me leave the glade.</p><p>"When none of the bigger beasts were nearby, I often wanted to leave the glade and go into the taiga to look around at what was going on there.</p><p>"But the moment I went any farther, one of them would always block my path. And growl at me.</p><p>"One time the she-bear even slapped me with its paw. I was so angry I decided never to look in its direction.</p><p>"It followed me around for an entire day, but I kept turning away. Then it let up a piteous wail. I felt sorry for it. I went and stroked it, and it began to lick my hand and feet joyously.</p><p>"That was when I realized that beasts talk with the intonations of their sounds and gestures, and I began to observe them closely and study their language.</p><p>"Subsequently, I realized they weren't letting me stray from the glade because that was the territory of other beasts that didn't know me the way everything in my home space did.</p><p>"From time to time, my grandfather and great-grandfather would come to the glade to visit and talk with me. They often asked me questions they wanted me to answer.</p><p>"Among us, the older generation treats a baby and a small child like a divinity, and through the child's answers verifies its own purity."</p><p>I began asking Anastasia to recall some specific question and its answer. She smiled and told me this story.</p><p>"One day I was playing with a snake. I turned around and my grandfather and great-grandfather were standing next to me, smiling. This made me very happy right away because they were interesting to be with. Only they could ask me questions, and their hearts beat in the same rhythm as mine. It's different in animals.</p><p>"I ran up to them. My great-grandfather leaned over to me, and my grandfather took me in his lap. I listened to his heart beat and combed through and examined the hairs in his beard. We were all silent. Thinking. And I felt so good deep down, so calm and joyful. Then my grandfather asked me, 'Anastasia, tell me why I have hair growing here'—and he pointed to his head and beard—'and not here?'— and he pointed to his forehead and nose.</p><p>"I touched his forehead and nose, but no answer came. I cannot speak rashly, I have to understand for myself.</p><p>"When they came the next time, my grandfather said again, 'I still keep wondering why I have hair here and not here.' And once again he pointed to his forehead and nose.</p><p>"My great-grandfather watched me closely and seriously. Then I thought maybe this really was a serious problem for him, and I asked, 'Grandfather, would you like it very much if it grew everywhere? On your forehead and nose, too?'</p><p>"My great-grandfather pondered this, but my grandfather replied, 'No, I wouldn't.'</p><p>"'So that's why it doesn't, because you don't want it to,' I told my grandfather.</p><p>"He seemed to be reflecting on this himself, stroking his beard.</p><p>"'You mean it grows here because I want it to?'</p><p>"'Of course, grandfather, you do, and I do, and so does whoever thought you up.'</p><p>"At this my great-grandfather asked me, rather excitedly, 'And who, who thought him up?'</p><p>"'The one who thought up everything,' I replied.</p><p>"'But where is he? Can you show me?' my great-grandfather asked, leaning over toward me.</p><p>"I couldn't answer him immediately, but this question stayed inside me, and I began thinking about it often."</p><p>"And you answered later?" I asked.</p><p>"Yes, about a year later, and I was given new questions. And until I answered them, my grandfathers wouldn't ask me new ones, which caused me much suffering."</p>

<p>I asked Anastasia who taught her to speak, if she barely remembered her mother and father and rarely saw her grandfather and great-grandfather. The answers I received astonished me and require interpretation by specialists, so I will try to reproduce them as fully as I can. For me their meaning started coming clear only gradually. First, after my question, she clarified.</p><p>"Do you mean the ability to speak in the languages of different people?"</p><p>"What do you mean 'different'? Are you saying you can speak different languages?"</p><p>"Yes," Anastasia replied.</p><p>"German, French, English, Japanese, Chinese?"</p><p>"If an interesting person shows up and you wish to pay him close attention, you can quickly learn to communicate in the language he's comfortable with. For instance, right now I'm speaking in your language."</p><p>"You mean Russian."</p><p>"In your Russian I try to speak using the same idioms and words you use in your speech. That was a little bit hard for me at first, since you have a small vocabulary and repetitive turns of phrase. Your emotions are weakly expressed, too. In that kind of language it's hard to set forth everything I'd like to precisely enough."</p><p>"Wait a minute, Anastasia. I'm going to ask you something in a foreign language and you answer me."</p><p>I said "hello" in English, then French. She immediately answered me, greeting me in gestures rather than words.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't speak any foreign languages. I studied German in school but got only fair grades. In German I did remember a whole sentence that my schoolmates and I learned well. I said it to Anastasia.</p><p>"Ich liebe dich, und gib mir deine Hand."</p><p>She held her hand out to me and answered in German, "I give you my hand."</p><p>She blushed, held out her hand to me, and whispered, "You said something very nice to me, Vladimir."</p><p>She understood me no matter what language I spoke.</p><p>Stunned by what I'd heard and still not believing my ears, I asked, "Are you saying that each person can be taught all languages?" I sensed intuitively that there had to be some simple explanation for this unusual phenomenon, and I wanted to understand it. "Anastasia, why don't you tell me in my language and try to give me examples, so that I can understand," I asked, a little agitated.</p><p>"Fine, fine, only calm down. Relax, or you won't understand. But first I will teach you to write in Russian."</p><p>"I know how to write. Tell me about learning foreign languages."</p><p>"Not just write, I'll teach you to be a writer, a talented writer. You will write a book."</p><p>"That's impossible."</p><p>"Not impossible! Simple."</p><p>Anastasia picked up a stick and drew in the earth the entire Russian alphabet and all the marks of punctuation and asked me how many letters there were there.</p><p>"Thirty-three," I answered.</p><p>"There, you see? Not many letters at all. Could you call what I've drawn a book?"</p><p>"No," I answered. "This is the ordinary alphabet and that's all. The ordinary letters."</p><p>"But after all, every Russian-language book consists of these ordinary letters," Anastasia remarked. "Do you agree with that? Do you understand how simple it all is?"</p><p>"Yes, but in books they're set out differently."</p><p>"That's right. All books consist of many combinations of these letters, and man sets them out automatically, guided by his emotions. This implies that first to be born is not the combination of letters and sounds but the feelings drawn by his imagination.</p><p>"The person who is going to read it has approximately the same feelings, and they are remembered for a long time. Can you remember any images or situations from the books you've read?"</p><p>"Yes," I said after thinking a moment.</p><p>For some reason I remembered Lermontov's Hero of Our Time, and I started telling Anastasia about it. She interrupted me.</p><p>"There, you see? You can draw the book's heroes and tell me what they felt, and quite a lot of time has passed since you read it. But if I had asked you to tell me what order the thirty-three letters were set out in and how their combinations were arranged, would you have been able to reproduce that?"</p><p>"No. That's impossible. I don't remember the entire text word for word."</p><p>"That really is very hard. So the feelings of one person were conveyed to another person with the help of every possible combination of those thirty-three letters. You looked at these combinations and immediately forgot them, but you retained the feelings and images for a long time. This means that if emotions are linked directly to these signs, if there is no thought of all the various conventions, the soul forces these signs to appear in a certain order, alternating combinations of them so that the reader will subsequently feel the writer's soul. And if the writer's soul has—"</p><p>"Wait a minute, Anastasia. You have to tell me more understandably, more concretely. Show me through some example about learning languages. Who taught you this?"</p><p>"My great-grandfather," Anastasia replied.</p><p>"Tell me using an example."</p><p>"He used to play with me."</p><p>"How did he play? Tell me."</p><p>"You have to calm down, relax. I just can't understand why you're so agitated."</p><p>She continued calmly.</p><p>"My great-grandfather used to play with me, as if he were joking. When he would visit me alone, without my grandfather, he would always walk up, bow at the waist, and hold out his hand, and I would hold out mine. First he would squeeze my hand, then he would get down on one knee, kiss my hand, and say, 'Hello, Anastasia.'</p><p>"One day, he came and did everything the same as always, and his eyes looked at me tenderly, as always, but his lips said something incomprehensible. I looked at him in surprise, and once again he said something else and completely incoherent. I couldn't stand it and asked, 'Grandpapa, have you forgotten what word to say?'</p><p>"'Yes,' my great-grandfather replied.</p><p>"Then my great-grandfather took a few steps away from me, thought about something, and walked up to me again, held out his hand to me, and I mine to him. He got down on his knee and kissed my hand. A tender look, and his lips were moving, but he wasn't saying anything at all. I actually got scared. Then I prompted him.</p><p>"'"Hello, Anastasia." Those are the words you've always said, grandpapa.'</p><p>"'Correct,' my great-grandfather confirmed, and he smiled.</p><p>"And I realized this was a game, and he and I played like that often. First it was easy, then the game got more and more complicated, but also more interesting. I tried to observe my great-grandfather's face very carefully and remember which words corresponded to the expressions of his eyes, the wrinkles on his forehead, the movement of his lips, and his barely noticeable gestures. It began when I was three and ended when I was eleven—when man takes a kind of exam that consists of closely watching the person he's talking to and being able to understand him without words, no matter what language he is using.</p><p>"That kind of dialog is much more perfect than speech, and also faster and fuller. You call this telepathy. You consider it unusual, something out of science fiction, but it simply involves an attentive attitude toward the person, a developed imagination, and a good memory. Behind it lies not simply a more perfect means of exchanging information but also knowledge of the human soul, the plant and animal world, the universe—everything, basically."</p><p>"This may all be true, but I thought you could speak any language. You just sense the person's thoughts, though, and then not immediately but after you've interacted with him for a certain time."</p><p>"Yes, that's true, Vladimir, but afterward you can remember all the words that correspond to his thoughts, no matter what language these words are spoken in. Also through this game you can learn to understand the desires of animals and birds."</p>

<p>Then I asked her to show me an example of her knowledge in the field of technology.</p><p>"You want me to tell you how various mechanisms from your world work?"</p><p>"Tell me something our greatest scientists have just barely touched on. Make some great scientific discovery."</p><p>"That's exactly what I've been doing for you this whole time."</p><p>"Not for me, for the scientific world, so that they recognize it as a discovery. Make a discovery to be proved in the area of technology, spaceships, the atom, or fuel, since you say it's all so simple."</p><p>"Compared with what I'm trying to explain to you, these spheres are, oh, how can I tell it in your way, for comparison, they're the Stone Age or something."</p><p>"That's just wonderful. You think it's primitive; on the other hand, it will be understandable. You're going to prove you're right and confirm that your intellect is above mine. Tell me, for instance, our airplanes and spaceships, do you consider them perfected mechanisms?"</p><p>"No. They're quite primitive. They're confirmation of the primitiveness of the technocratic path of development."</p><p>This answer put me on my guard, since I realized that either she truly knew incomparably more than the ordinary mind could imagine or else her opinions were those of a madman. I kept trying to elicit an answer.</p><p>"What makes our rockets and planes primitive?"</p><p>Anastasia answered me after a brief pause, as if she were trying to understand what I'd said.</p><p>"The movement of all your mechanisms, absolutely all of them, is based on combustion. Not knowing more perfect, natural sources, you utilize something primitive and unwieldy with incredible stubbornness. You aren't even stopped by the ruinous consequences of its use. Your airplanes and rockets have simply laughable duration of flight, and they only rise a little bit above the Earth, relative to the Universe, and meanwhile this method has nearly reached its upper limit. But that's silly! A combustible or flammable substance pushes this unwieldy construction, what you call a spaceship. At the same time, the larger part of this ship is designed to 'solve' precisely the problem of thrust."</p><p>"What other principle of movement in the air could there be?"</p><p>"For example, like in a flying saucer," Anastasia replied.</p><p>"What? You know about flying saucers and the principles of their movement?"</p><p>"Of course I do. It's very simple and rational."</p><p>My throat actually dried up and I tried to hurry her along.</p><p>"Tell me, Anastasia, quickly and understandably."</p><p>"Fine, only don't get upset. If you're upset this will be harder for you to grasp. The principle of a flying saucer's movement is based on the energy of vacuum production."</p><p>"How's that? Make yourself clearer."</p><p>"You have a poor vocabulary, but for this to be understandable to you I must use only that."</p><p>"I'll add to it right now," I blurted, agitated: "bank, roof, tablet, air ..." and I started quickly listing all the words that came to mind at that moment. I even cursed.</p><p>Anastasia interrupted me.</p><p>"Stop, I know all the words you could use to express yourself, but there are others, too, and a whole other way of conveying information. Using it I could explain to you in a minute what might otherwise take a couple of hours. That's a lot, and I'd like to tell you about something more important."</p><p>"No, Anastasia. Tell me about the saucer, the principle of its movement, and its energy sources. Until I understand I won't hear anything else."</p><p>"Fine," she continued. "Combustion is when a solid substance is quickly transformed under a specific influence into a gaseous one, or when in the course of some reaction two gaseous substances turn into lighter ones. Everyone understands this, of course."</p><p>"Yes," I replied, "if you light gunpowder, it turns into smoke, and gasoline turns into a gas."</p><p>"Yes, more or less. But if you or all of you had purer intentions and, hence, knowledge of nature's mechanisms, you would have realized long ago that if there is a substance that can expand significantly and explode, shifting to another state, then there has to be the opposite process. In nature, these are the living microorganisms that transform gaseous substances into solids. In general, all plants do this, only with varying speed and degree of solidity and firmness of what is created. Look around you. They drink the earth's sap and breathe the air and from this produce a solid and firm body—wood, say, or, even more solid and firm, a nutshell, or a pit, like a plum has. Invisible to the eye, the microorganism does this at very great speed, seemingly feeding only on air. These microorganisms are the flying saucer's engines. They resemble the brain's microcellule, only with a very narrow function. They have just one function: movement. But they perform it perfectly and can push the apparatus to one-nineteenth of the speed of thought of Earth's present-day average statistical person. They are on the inside of the upper part of the flying saucer, between its double walls, which are about three centimeters apart. The upper and lower surface of the outer walls is porous, with micro-holes. Through these little holes the microorganisms suck in air, thereby creating a vacuum in front of the saucer. The streams of air begin to solidify even before they touch the saucer, and when they pass through the microorganisms they turn into little balls. Then these little balls increase in size, to about half a centimeter in diameter, soften, and slip between the walls to the lower part of the saucer and once again disintegrate into a gaseous substance. You can eat them if you manage to before they fall apart.</p><p>"But what are the flying saucer's walls made of?"</p><p>"They're grown."</p><p>"How's that?"</p><p>"Why are you so surprised? Think about it. Lots of people grow a fungus, in various vessels, and the fungus makes water into which they mix it something tasty and a little sour. This fungus takes on the form of the vessel it's in. This fungus, by the way, looks a lot like a flying saucer. It makes double walls, too. If to its water you add one more microorganism, solidification occurs, but this so-called microorganism can be produced or, rather, spawned, by efforts of the brain, or will, a vivid imagination."</p><p>"Can you do that?"</p><p>"Yes, only my efforts alone wouldn't be enough. It requires the effect of a few dozen people possessing the same abilities, and it has to be done over the course of a year."</p><p>"But is there everything necessary here on Earth to make—or spawn, as you put it—this flying saucer and these microorganisms?"</p><p>"Of course there is. The Earth has everything the Universe does."</p><p>"But how are the microorganisms placed inside the saucer's walls if they're so small you can't see them?"</p><p>"When the upper wall is spawned, it itself attracts them and collects them in huge quantities, the way hives attract bees. But here, too, efforts of will are required from several dozen people. What's the point of detailing all this any further, though, if you still won't be able to spawn it due to your lack right now of people with the appropriate will, intellect, and knowledge?"</p><p>"You really can't help in any way?"</p><p>"I can."</p><p>"Then do it"</p><p>"I already have."</p><p>"What have you done?" I didn’t understand.</p><p>"I told you how to raise children. And I'll tell you more. You'll tell other people. Many will understand this and their children, raised in this way, will possess the intellect, knowledge, and will that will allow them to make not only a primitive flying saucer but significantly more as well."</p><p>"Anastasia, how do you know all this about the flying saucer? Is it really through communicating with plants?"</p><p>"They landed here, and I, well, I sort of helped them repair it."</p><p>"Are they a lot smarter than us?"</p><p>"Not at all. They're immeasurably far behind man. They're afraid of him and don't come close to people, although they're very curious. At first they were afraid of me. They aimed thought-paralyzers at me. They huffed and puffed. They were trying to frighten and astonish me. I had a hard time calming them down and being nice to them."</p><p>"How could they not be smarter if they can do what man still can't?"</p><p>"What's surprising about that? Bees make incredible constructions out of natural materials with an entire heating and ventilation system, but that doesn't mean they're above man in intellect. There is no one and nothing in the Universe more powerful than man except God.</p>

<p>The possibility of creating a flying saucer intrigued me. If you consider just its principle of movement as a hypothesis, then it is new. A flying saucer, though, is a complex mechanism and for us Earthlings not an item of first necessity.</p><p>Therefore I felt like hearing something that would be immediately understood. A "something" that would not require any investigations by scientific minds but could be applied in practice in our life immediately and bring benefit to all people. I began asking Anastasia to give me a solution to some acute problem our society faces today. She agreed, but asked, "You'll first have to formulate it, this problem. How can I solve it without knowing what you want?"</p><p>I began to think of what was most relevant today, and the following parameters of the problem came to my mind.</p><p>"You know, Anastasia, in our big cities we face a very acute pollution problem today. The air there is so bad, it's hard to breathe."</p><p>"You're the ones polluting it."</p><p>"Certainly, we are. Listen some more, only don't philosophize about how we need to be cleaner, have more trees, and so on. Take everything just the way it is today, and come up with something. Well, for instance, something to make the air in the big cities fifty percent cleaner but so that it requires no money from the treasury, no state money, I mean. And so that what you come up with is the most rational of all possible options and could be implemented instantly and be understandable to me and everyone else."</p><p>"I'll try immediately," Anastasia replied. "Have you listed all the parameters?"</p><p>Just in case, I tried to make the problem even more complicated. What if her intellect and capabilities really did prove to be much higher than our reason's conceptions allowed for? Therefore I added, "Whatever you come up with should also yield a profit."</p><p>"For whom?"</p><p>"Me, and the country, too. You live in Russia, that means all of Russia."</p><p>"By this you mean money?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And a lot?"</p><p>"Anastasia, there can never be too much profit, that is to say, money. But I need enough to pay for this expedition and cover another, while Russia ..."</p><p>I thought a little. What if Anastasia did have an interest in our civilization's material goods?</p><p>I asked, "You don't want anything for yourself?"</p><p>"I have everything," she replied.</p><p>All of a sudden I had an idea, and I realized how I could interest her.</p><p>"You know, Anastasia, let what you come up with yield enough money so that all your beloved summer people, the gardeners, all over Russia, can obtain seeds for free or on advantageous terms."</p><p>"That's wonderful!" Anastasia exclaimed. "You've thought of something fine. I'll work on this right away, if that's all you have. I like this so much! Seeds. . . . Or do you have something else?"</p><p>"No, Anastasia, that's enough for now."</p><p>I could tell the task itself had inspired her, especially the free seeds for her summer people. But at the time I was still certain that even given her abilities the problem of clean air simply did not have a solution, otherwise our many scientific institutes would have found it already.</p><p>Anastasia lay down on the grass vigorously, not calmly as usual, and flung her arms out to either side. Her curved fingers faced fingertips up and would move and then be still, and the lashes of her closed eyes would flutter from time to time.</p><p>She lay there like that for about twenty minutes and then opened her eyes, sat up, and said, "I've determined it. But what a nightmare."</p><p>"What did you determine? What's the nightmare?"</p><p>"The greatest harm is inflicted on you by your cars. You have so many of them in the big cities, and each one emits a nasty smell and substances that harm the organism. What is most terrible is that those substances mingle with and permeate particles of dirt and dust. Traffic raises this permeated dust, and people breathe in this horrible mixture. It flies in all directions and comes to rest on the grass and trees and covers everything everywhere. This is very bad. Very harmful for the health of people and plants."</p><p>"Of course it's bad. But everyone knows that. Only no one can do anything. There are cleaning machines, but they aren't up to the task. Anastasia, you've discovered absolutely nothing new. You haven't come up with an original solution to cleaning the pollution."</p><p>"I've only just determined the main source of the harm. Now I'll analyze and think. I need to concentrate for a long time, maybe even an hour, because I've never studied these kinds of problems before. I don't want you to be bored, so go take a walk through the forest."</p><p>"You go ahead and think and I'll find something to keep me busy."</p><p>Anastasia turned completely inward. After an hour's walk through the forest, I found her dissatisfied, it seemed to me, and I said, "You see, Anastasia, here even your brain is powerless. Only don't get upset. We have many scientific institutions working on this problem, but, like you, they've only established the fact of pollution. So far they haven't been able to do anything either."</p><p>She replied in a somewhat apologetic tone.</p><p>"I've sorted through all the possible options, I think, but to do this quickly and by fifty percent—I couldn't do that."</p><p>I went on the alert: she had found some solution after all.</p><p>"What percentage did you come up with?" I asked.</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>"I fell short by a lot. I came up with . . . thirty-five to forty percent."</p><p>"What?" I couldn't keep from exclaiming.</p><p>"Not so great, right?" Anastasia asked.</p><p>My throat went dry. I felt that she couldn't lie and exaggerate or minimize what she said. Trying to restrain my excitement, I said, "Let's change the conditions of the problem. Let it be for thirty-eight percent. Tell me quickly what you came up with."</p><p>"All those cars have to collect all that nasty dust, not just throw it up."</p><p>"How can that be done? Tell me quickly!"</p><p>"Up in front, oh, what do you call the part that sticks out there?"</p><p>"The bumper," I helped her.</p><p>"Right, the bumper. Inside or under it you need to make a box with holes in its top part, and there should also be little holes behind, for the air to get out. When these cars move the streams of harmful dusty air will fall into the front holes, be cleaned, and the air going out the back holes will be twenty percent cleaner."</p><p>"But where is your forty percent?"</p><p>"Right now this dust is hardly picked up off the street. But with this method there would be much less of it, so it could be cleaned up every day and everywhere. I calculated that in a month, with these little boxes, assuming they were installed on all cars, the quantity of dirty dust would decrease by forty percent. After that the percentage of pollution wouldn't decrease because other factors come into play."</p><p>"What is the size of the box, what should be in it, and how many holes should it have and at what spacing?"</p><p>"Vladimir, would you like me to attach it to each car, too?"</p><p>For the first time I saw she had a sense of humor, and I laughed out loud, picturing Anastasia bolting her boxes to cars. She started laughing, too, delighted at my merriment, and she spun around the glade.</p><p>The idea really was simple; the rest was just a technical matter. Already, without Anastasia, I could picture how all this might work: decrees from administration heads, auto inspectorate monitoring, changing filters at gas stations, turning in old ones, vouchers, and so on. A straightforward solution, like seatbelts.</p><p>One stroke of the pen and there were seatbelts in every car. And here, one stroke of the pen and the air would be cleaner. And entrepreneurs would fight for orders for the boxes, and there would be work for factories, and most of all, the air would be cleaner as a result.</p><p>"Wait a minute." I turned again to Anastasia, who was spinning in her merry dance.</p><p>"What should be in these boxes?"</p><p>"In these boxes ... in these boxes ... Why don't you think about it a little? It's very simple," she answered without stopping.</p><p>"But where will the money come from for me and for the summer people, enough for their seeds?" I asked my question again.</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>"What do you mean where? You asked that the idea be the most rational. Here I thought one up, the most rational one. It's going to be used in big cities all over Russia and they'll pay Russia enough for this idea to pay for free seeds and for you. Only you can obtain one for yourself only under certain conditions."</p><p>At the time I paid no attention to what she was saying about certain conditions and began trying to clarify something else.</p><p>"So you mean it has to be patented? Who would pay voluntarily?</p><p>"Why wouldn't they? They will, and I'll set a percentage right now. From the boxes produced, Russia would get two percent and you one hundredth of a percent."</p><p>"What's the use of your percentage? In some things you're strong, but in business you're a total neophyte. No one is going to pay voluntarily. They don't always pay even when there are signed contracts. If only you knew how many accounts receivable we had. The arbitration courts are overloaded. Do you know what an arbitration court is?"</p><p>"I can guess. But in this case they'll pay punctiliously. Anyone who refuses will go bust. Only the honest ones will flourish."</p><p>"Why should they go bust? Are you going to turn into an enforcer or something?"</p><p>"What won't you think of. My goodness. They themselves, or rather, circumstances will take shape around the cheats in such a way that they go bust."</p><p>Right then I had a thought. If you considered that Anastasia couldn't lie and, as she herself said, natural mechanisms wouldn't allow her to be wrong, that meant before making these statements she must have worked out in her mind an unprecedented quantity of information and made tremendous arithmetic calculations, while bearing in mind the huge number of psychological factors of the people who would be involved in her project. In our language, she not only solved the very difficult problem of cleaning the air but also composed and analyzed a business plan—and all this in about an hour and a half. I decided to clarify a few details.</p><p>"Tell me, Anastasia, did you do the calculations in your mind, using the percentage of clean air, the amount of money that would come from the production of your boxes installed on cars, from filter replacements, and so on?"</p><p>"Calculations were done, and very detailed ones, only not using my brain."</p><p>"Stop! Quiet. Let me finish my thought. Tell me, could you compete with the most advanced computer, say, a Japanese or American one?"</p><p>"But I'm not interested in that," she replied. "That seems so primitive and demeaning. Competing with a computer is like . . . oh, how can I explain it to you using a clear example? It's like vying with a prosthetic arm or leg, and not even a full prosthesis but part of one. A computer lacks the main thing. And the main thing is feelings."</p><p>I began trying to prove the opposite, telling her how among us people who are considered highly intelligent and respected in society play chess with a computer. But when neither this nor other arguments convinced her, I asked her to do this for me and for other people as proof of the possibilities of the human brain. She agreed, and then I clarified.</p><p>"You mean I can officially announce your readiness to compete with a Japanese supercomputer in solving problems?"</p><p>"Why Japanese?" Anastasia asked.</p><p>"Because they're considered the best in the world."</p><p>"Is that so? Why don't I do it with all of them at once, so you don't ask me to do this boring thing again later."</p><p>"Marvelous!" I rejoiced. "Do it with all of them, only formulate a problem."</p><p>"Fine," Anastasia agreed reluctantly. "But for starters, so I don't waste time on formulating one, let them solve the same problem you set for me and confirm or refute my solution. If they refute it, then they have to suggest their own. Life and people will judge us."</p><p>"Marvelous, Anastasia! Great idea! This is constructive. And how much time do you think it will take for them to provide a solution to this problem? I don't think the hour and a half you took would be enough. Let's give them three months."</p><p>"All right, three."</p><p>"I suggest letting anyone who wants to be a judge. If there are a lot of them, then no one will try to influence their opinion out of greed."</p><p>"So be it, but I'd like to talk some more with you about raising children."</p><p>Anastasia considered childrearing the main thing and always spoke about this with pleasure. My fancy of competing with computers aroused no particular interest in her. However, I was still happy to have obtained her consent. Now I wanted to call on firms that put out modern computers to join the competition to solve the problem set out above.</p><p>I decided to clarify something with Anastasia.</p><p>"What prize should be named for the winner?"</p><p>"I don't need anything!" she replied.</p><p>"Why are you talking about yourself? Are you so sure of your victory?"</p><p>"Naturally, I'm a human being."</p><p>"Well, fine. What might you offer anyway to a firm that took first place after you?"</p><p>"Well, I could suggest how to improve their primitive computer."</p><p>"It's a deal!"</p>

<h2>19. "… In Him was life, and the life was the light of Men…”</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>
<p>— Gospel of John</p><p>One day, at my request, Anastasia took me to see the ringing cedar her grandfather and great-grandfather had spoken of. We had not gone far from the glade when I saw it. The forty-meter tree loomed over those nearby, but its main distinction was that its crown seemed to shine, creating a halo like the ones they draw on icons around the faces of saints. The halo was not even; it pulsed. At its acme a fine ray formed and receded into the heavens' infinity.</p><p>The spectacle bewitched and enchanted me.</p><p>At Anastasia's suggestion I pressed my palm to its trunk and felt a ringing—or a crackling comparable to what you might hear under a high-voltage power line, only more resonant.</p><p>"I was the one who happened to find a way to return this energy to the Cosmos and then scatter it on Earth," Anastasia informed me. "See, the bark is torn in various places. That was the she-bear climbing. I had a hard time making it carry me to the lowest branches. I clung to the fur at its nape. It was climbing and bellowing, climbing and bellowing. That's how I got to the lowest branches, and I climbed the rest to the very top. I sat there for two days and you can't imagine the things I thought of. I stroked it, and I shouted upward, but nothing helped.</p><p>"My grandfather and great-grandfather arrived. You can imagine what happened then. They stood below, keeping watch over me and demanding I climb down. I, in turn, was demanding they tell me what to do with the cedar. How to save the ringing cedar, since people hadn't sawed it down. They wouldn't say. But I sensed they knew. My grandfather—he's a sly one—wanted to trick me and started promising to help me settle things with a certain woman I just couldn't find a way to contact.</p><p>"I very much wanted to help her. Before that my grandfather had just been angry at me for spending so much time on her and not doing other things. But I knew he couldn't help me because my great-grandfather had tried twice, unbeknownst to my grandfather, and hadn't been able to either.</p><p>"Then my grandfather became totally distraught. He grabbed a branch and ran around the cedar, lashing the air with the branch and shouting that I was the most muddle-headed person in the family, I was acting alogically, I wasn't taking intelligent advice, and he was going to teach me with a switch on my rear end. And all the while he was lashing the air with the branch. What a thing for him to do! Even my great-grandfather started laughing. So did I. Right then a branch broke off by accident at the top and a glow came from it. I heard my great-grandfather's voice, very serious, demanding and imploring simultaneously.</p><p>"Don't touch it, dear granddaughter, don't do anything more, come down very carefully, you've already done everything."</p><p>"I obeyed and climbed down. My great-grandfather embraced me without saying a word. He himself was trembling and pointing at the cedar. On it, more and more branches were beginning to glow, and then a ray formed and shone upward. Now the ringing cedar won't burn. Through its ray it will give everything it has stored up for five hundred years to people and the Earth. My great-grandfather explained that the ray formed right where I'd shouted up and accidentally broken the branch when I was laughing. My great-grandfather said that if I'd touched the ray emanating from the broken branch, my brain would have burst, since there was too much energy and information in that ray, and that that was exactly how my papa and mama had died."</p><p>Anastasia placed her palms on the mighty trunk of the ringing cedar she had saved, pressed her cheek to it, was silent for a while, and then went on with her story.</p><p>"They, my dear papa and mama, had discovered a ringing cedar like this. Only my mama did things a little differently because she didn't know. She climbed a tree next to the ringing cedar, reached to the lowest branch of the ringing cedar, and broke it off, accidentally illuminating herself with the ray that blazed out of the twig. The twig was pointed down and the ray went into the ground. This is very bad, very harmful, when that kind of energy falls into the earth. When my papa came along he saw the ray and mama, who had been left hanging there, one hand with a death grip on the branch of the ordinary cedar. In the other she held the broken branch of the ringing cedar.</p><p>"My papa must have understood everything. He climbed the ringing cedar, climbed to the top. My grandfather and great-grandfather saw him break off the top branches, but they didn't glow, while the lower ones began glowing more and more. My great-grandfather said that my papa realized that a little more and he would never be able to climb down, but the ray shining up, the pulsing glow, still had not appeared, there were just more and more fine rays shining down. The upper ray appeared when my papa broke a large branch aimed upward. And although it didn't shine, he bent it and aimed it at himself.</p><p>"When it blazed up, my papa was still able to unclench his hands, and the ray from the straightened out branch shot into the sky and then formed a pulsing halo.</p><p>"My great-grandfather said that in the last instant of his life my papa's brain absorbed a huge stream of energy and information, that in some incredible way he was able to cleanse himself of all the information stored there before, and so he was able to play for time so that he could unclench his hands and direct the branch upward before the explosion."</p><p>Anastasia stroked the cedar with her palms one more time, pressed her cheek to it, and stood still, smiling, listening to the ringing of the tree.</p><p>"Anastasia, is the oil of the cedar nut stronger or weaker in its healing properties than pieces of the ringing cedar?"</p><p>"The same. If the nuts are gathered at a specific time and with a specific attitude toward the cedar. Then the cedar itself produces it."</p><p>"Do you know how to do that?"</p><p>"Yes, I do."</p><p>"Will you tell me?"</p><p>"Yes, all right."</p>

<h2>20. You Need to Change Your World View</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>
<p>I asked Anastasia what kind of woman it was she'd had her conflict with her grandfather over, why she couldn't find a way to contact her, and why she needed that contact.</p><p>"You have to understand," Anastasia began her story, "it's very important when two people join their lives together that they have a spiritual attraction. Unfortunately, it all mainly begins with the flesh. For example, you see a beautiful young woman and want to be intimate with her. You still haven't seen the person, her soul. Often people join their fates solely on the basis of fleshly attraction. That quickly passes and switches over to something else. What binds people together then?</p><p>"It's not all that hard to find someone close to you in spirit with whom you can acquire genuine happiness, but in your technocratic world there are so many obstacles. The woman I've been trying to contact lives in a big city and travels regularly to the same place, probably her job. There or along the way she is constantly finding or encountering a person very close to her in spirit with whom she could be truly happy, but most importantly they would have a child capable of bringing the world much good. Because they would have created him in the same impulse as we did. But this man simply cannot get up the nerve to declare himself to this woman, and she herself is partly to blame. Imagine, he looks in her face and sees his soul's chosen one, while she, as soon as she senses anyone's gaze, immediately tightens her belt and pulls her skirt up a little higher and tries to lift it "accidentally." Well, and so on. This man immediately gets carnal feelings, but he doesn't know her, so he goes to see a woman he knows better, who is more accessible to him, attracted by these same carnal feelings.</p><p>"I want to tell this woman what to do, but I can't get through to her. Her mind won't open up to receive information for a second. She works wholeheartedly only on problems of daily life. Imagine, one time I followed her for an entire day. It was awful! Later my grandfather warned me that I was working very little with my summer people, spreading myself thin and prying in other people's territory.</p><p>"She wakes up in the morning and her very first thought is not to rejoice at the coming day but what to cook. She gets upset that she's out of some kind of food, then she gets upset that she's out of something you use to rub on yourself in the morning, either a cream or paint. She is constantly thinking about how to get it. She is constantly late and forever running, hoping that first one, then another means of transport doesn't leave without her.</p><p>"At the place she always goes to, her brain is generally overloaded—how can I explain it to you?—well, with all kinds of nonsense, to my mind. On the one hand, outwardly her brain is supposed to make her facial expression practical and perform some work assignment of hers. At the same time she's thinking about a girlfriend or acquaintance of hers and fuming at her. Simultaneously she is listening to what the people around her are saying. And imagine, it's like this day in and day out, day in and day out, like a wind-up toy.</p><p>"On her way home, when people see her she pretends to be an almost happy woman. But in fact she is constantly thinking about problems and paints, examining the clothing in stores, especially the kind that reveal her tempting charms, assuming this will bring about some miracle, although in her case the opposite happens. She comes home and starts to clean her house. She thinks she's relaxing when she's watching her television and fussing with food, and the main thing is for her to think about something good for a single second. Even when she goes to bed, everyday cares fill her thoughts.</p><p>"If she had just torn herself away from them for a minute that day and thought about—"</p><p>"Wait a minute, Anastasia. You have to explain how you see her, what she looks like, her clothing, and what she should be thinking about at the moment this man is near her. What should she do so he will try to declare his intentions to her?"</p><p>Anastasia told me everything in the minutest detail. I will quote here what I think is the crux.</p><p>"A dress slightly below the knees, green, no cleavage, with a small white collar, almost no makeup, she listens with interest to the person conversing with her."</p><p>"And that's it," I commented after hearing this simple explanation.</p><p>To which Anastasia remarked, "There's a lot behind these simple things. For her to choose just this dress, to use makeup differently, and to look at someone with genuine interest she would have to change her world-view."</p>

<p>"I also have to tell you about the conditions under which you will get the money out of the bank when there is a lot in your accounts, Vladimir."</p><p>"Tell me, Anastasia. This is a pleasant procedure."</p><p>But what I heard blew my mind. Judge for yourself.</p><p>"In order for you to take the money out of your bank account, you will have to observe the following conditions. First of all, you cannot use alcohol for three days before you withdraw the money. When you arrive at the bank, the bank's senior officer will have to use the instruments you have to verify that you have met this condition in the presence of at least two witnesses. If this first condition is met, then you can move to implementation of the second. You will have to bow at least nine times to the bank's officer and the two witnesses."</p><p>When her sense, or rather, nonsense, reached me, I jumped up and she rose as well. I could not believe my ears and asked for clarification.</p><p>"First they're going to check me for alcohol, and then I have to bow to the witnesses at least nine times in addition. Is that right?"</p><p>"Yes," Anastasia replied. "For each bow they can give you a sum of no more than a million of your rubles at today's value."</p><p>Rage, fury, and irritation, filled me.</p><p>"Why did you say this? Why? I was feeling so good. I believed you. I was starting to think you were right about a lot of things, that there was a logic to your conclusions. But you ... Now I'm absolutely certain you're not quite right. You negated it all with your last statement. There's no sense or logic to it, and it's not just me, any normal person would tell you the same. Maybe you want me to set out these conditions in your book, too?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Well, that's completely abnormal. Are you going to write your instruction to the banks or issue a decree?"</p><p>"No. They'll read them in the book, and each one will deal with you this way. Otherwise they face ruin."</p><p>"Oh my God! And I've been listening to this creature for more than two days? Maybe you'd like the bank officer to bow to the witnesses with me?"</p><p>"It would be good for him as well as you. This would bring great benefit, but I have not set conditions as strict for them as for you."</p><p>"You mean, you've only shown this favor to me? Can you even imagine what a laughingstock you've made of me? Here's what the love of an abnormal hermit can turn into!</p><p>"Only none of this is going to work. No bank will agree to serve me under these conditions, no matter how much you model your situations. Look how your dreams have gotten away from you. You can bow here in the taiga all you like."</p><p>"The banks will agree and open the accounts even without your knowledge—true, only those banks that want to work honestly. People will trust them and come to them," Anastasia continued to insist.</p><p>Irritation and rage were building up in me more and more. I was angry at myself and at Anastasia.</p><p>That's all I needed. I'd listened to her so much, tried so hard to understand what she said, and she was basically half-crazy. I started expressing myself to Anastasia in crude terms, to put it mildly.</p><p>She stood there, leaning back against the tree, her head bowed slightly forward. One of her hands was pressed to her chest, and the other was raised up, waving slightly.</p><p>I recognized this gesture. She repeated it each time she was calming the environment, so I wouldn't be afraid, and this time I realized why she was trying to calm it.</p><p>It was as if every offensive or harsh word addressed to Anastasia lashed her and made her body shudder.</p><p>I fell silent. I sat back down on the grass, turned away from Anastasia, and decided I was going to calm myself now and go to the riverbank. I wasn't going to talk to her at all anymore, but when I heard her voice behind me I was amazed that there was no insult or reproach in its tone.</p><p>"You have to understand, Vladimir, man brings on himself everything bad that is happening to man when he violates the rules of spiritual existence and breaks his connection with nature.</p><p>"The dark forces are trying to distract him with the up-to-the-minute attractiveness of your technocratic existence and force him not to think about the simple truths and commandments already set forth in the Bible. And they are frequently successful.</p><p>"One of man's mortal sins is pride. Most people are subject to it, this sin. I'm not going to expound for you right now on the tremendous perniciousnous of this sin. Once you've returned and decided to sort things out, you'll understand this yourself or with the help of the enlightened people who will come to see you, but for now I will just say that the forces of darkness, as the opposition to the forces of light, are seeing to it every second that man retains this sin, and money serves them in this as one of their main instruments. They are the ones who thought it up.</p><p>"Money is like a high-tension zone.</p><p>"The forces of darkness are proud of their invention. They even believe they are stronger than the forces of light because of inventing money. And they use it to distract man from his true purpose.</p><p>"This great confrontation has been going on for millennia, and man is at its center. But I don't want you to be subject to this sin.</p><p>"I realize I won't get by here on explanations alone. Over the millennia humanity has not understood the explanations or comprehended the method for countering this sin. It's natural you wouldn't be able to either.</p><p>"But I very much wanted to rid you of this mortal danger, this corruption of the spirit. I thought up a situation especially for you in which this mechanism of the dark forces would falter, break down, or even work in reverse—to the eradication of sin. That's why they became so enraged.</p><p>"Their rage settled in you and you started shouting insulting words at me. They wanted me to get angry at you, but I would never do that. I realized that what I had thought up had hit its mark, and it's now clear to me that their mechanisms, which have been functioning faultlessly for millennia, can be broken. So far I've done this just for you, but I'll come up with something for the others, too.</p><p>"What is so awful about you drinking that intoxicating poison less and not being arrogant and obstinate? What were you so indignant about? Naturally, it was pride that had come into play in you."</p><p>She fell silent, and I thought, "It's incredible, but her mind, or something else there, is investing so much deep meaning into this comic, absolutely irregular situation, this bowing at a bank, and there might actually be some logic to it. I really should sort this out more calmly."</p><p>Any anger at Anastasia passed, and a sense of vague guilt arose instead, but I would not apologize then and only turned to face her, desiring reconciliation. Anastasia seemed to sense my inner state, and she immediately roused herself joyfully and quickly began talking.</p>

<p>"Your brain is weary of trying to comprehend me, but I still have much I'd like to say, and I'd like to, but you need to rest. Let's sit down again for a little while."</p><p>We sat down on the grass. Anastasia took me by the shoulders and drew me toward her. The back of my head touched her breast, feeling a pleasant warmth.</p><p>"Don't be afraid of me. Relax," she said quietly, and she lay down on the grass so that I could rest more comfortably. She lowered her fingers into my hair, as if combing it, and with the fingertips of her other hand quickly touched first my forehead and then my temples. Sometimes she lightly pricked various spots on my head with her nails. All this gave me a sensation of tranquility and enlightenedness. Then, placing her hands on my shoulders, Anastasia said, "Please listen to what sounds are around you now."</p><p>I listened, and my ear caught many differences in tonality, rhythm, and duration of sound.</p><p>I started listing them out loud: birds singing in the trees, insects chirring and clicking in the grass, trees rustling, and bird wings clapping and making noise. After listing everything I was hearing, I fell silent, continuing to listen closely, and I found this pleasant and very interesting.</p><p>"You didn't name them all," Anastasia remarked.</p><p>"Yes, I did," I replied. "Well, I might have missed something not very significant or inaudible to me—something unimportant, that is."</p><p>"Vladimir, can you really not hear my heart beating?" Anastasia asked.</p><p>Indeed, how could I not have noticed that sound? The sound of her heart beating.</p><p>"Yes," I quickly told her, "of course I hear it. I hear it very well. It's beating evenly and calmly."</p><p>"Try to remember the intervals of the sounds you're hearing. To do that, choose the main ones and remember them."</p><p>I chose an insect's chirring, a crow's cawing, and water gurgling and splashing in the stream.</p><p>"Now I'll speed up the beating of my heart, and you listen to what happens around you."</p><p>Anastasia's heartbeat quickened and, in its wake, so did the rhythms of the sounds I could hear around me, and their tonality rose.</p><p>"Astonishing! This is simply incredible!" I exclaimed. "Do you mean they are reacting so keenly to the rhythm of your heartbeat, Anastasia?"</p><p>"Yes. All, absolutely all of them: the little blade of grass, the big tree, the bugs. They're responding to the change in my heart's rhythm. The trees are speeding up their internal processes and are starting to manufacture more oxygen."</p><p>"Do all the plants and animals around people react like that?" I asked.</p><p>"No. In your world they don't understand who to react to, and you don't try to make contact with them, don't understand the purpose of this contact, and don't give them sufficient information about yourselves.</p><p>"Something like this might happen with the plants and people who work in their own small gardens, if the people do everything the way I've already told you—saturating the seeds with information about themselves and communicating with the plants more consciously. Do you want me to show you what sensation a person who has this kind of contact would feel?"</p><p>"Of course I do, but how will you manage that?"</p><p>"I'll match the rhythm of my heartbeat to yours, and you'll feel it."</p><p>She slipped her hand under my shirt. Her warm palm pressed lightly on my chest, and her heart, gradually adjusting, began beating in the same rhythm as mine.</p><p>Something amazing happened. An extraordinarily pleasant sensation arose, as if next to me were loving relatives and my mama. A softening and health appeared in my body, and in my soul a joy, a freedom, and what felt like a new understanding of the universe.</p><p>The range of sounds around me caressed me and told me the truth they knew, which I still did not fully understand but only intuited.</p><p>All the joyful and mellow feelings I had ever experienced in my life seemed to merge into a single beautiful sensation. This may be what most call happiness.</p><p>But as soon as Anastasia began to alter the rhythm of her own heartbeat, the wonderful sensation began to dissipate. I asked, "More! More, please, Anastasia."</p><p>"I can't do that for too long. After all, I have my own rhythm."</p><p>"Well, just a little more," I asked.</p><p>Once again Anastasia briefly returned to me the sensation of happiness. Then it all dissipated, leaving me nonetheless a particle of the pleasant and shining sensation in the form of a memory.</p><p>We were silent for a while. Then I once felt like hearing Anastasia's voice again, so I asked, "Was that how good it was for the first people, Adam and Eve? Lie down, revel, flourish. It's all here. Only it would get boring if there was nothing to do."</p><p>Instead of answering, Anastasia asked me a question.</p><p>"Tell me, Vladimir, do many people think like that about the first man, Adam, the way you just did?"</p><p>"Most, probably. What was there for them to do, in paradise? It was later that man began to develop and dream up all kinds of things. Labor developed man. He became smarter, too, thanks to labor."</p><p>"You do have to labor, but the first man was immeasurably smarter than today's, and his labor was more significant and demanded great intellect, consciousness, and will."</p><p>"So what did Adam do in paradise? Cultivate a garden? If so, now every gardener can do that, to say nothing of horticulturalists. The Bible says nothing more about Adam's activities."</p><p>"If the Bible were to set it all out in detail, it would take more than a whole human life to finish reading. The Bible has to be understood. There is a tremendous amount of information behind each of its lines. You want to know what Adam did? I'll tell you. But first remember, the Bible says that God ordered Adam to give each creature living on Earth a name and a purpose. And he—Adam—did just that. He did something all the scientific institutions in the whole world put together have still not achieved."</p><p>"Anastasia, do you yourself turn to God and ask Him for anything for yourself?"</p><p>"What could I ask for when I've been given so much? I have to thank Him and help Him."</p>

<h2>23. Who Raises Our Son?</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************</br>
</div>
<p>On the way to the river, as Anastasia was accompanying me to my boat, we sat down to rest at the spot where she had left her outer clothing.</p><p>"Anastasia, how will we raise our son?"</p><p>"Try to grasp this, Vladimir. You are still unable to raise him, and when his eyes look at the world consciously for the first time, you should not be by his side."</p><p>I grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her.</p><p>"What are you saying? What are you presuming? I don't understand where you come up with these unique conclusions. The very fact of your existence is unlikely, but all this doesn't give you the right to decide everything yourself, in violation of all the laws of logic."</p><p>"Please calm yourself, Vladimir. I don't know what logic you have in mind, but try to make sense of everything calmly."</p><p>"What do I have to make sense of? The child isn't just yours. He's mine, too, and I want him to have a father. I want him to have everything and the chance to get an education."</p><p>"You have to understand, he doesn't need material goods as you understand them. He'll have everything from the very beginning. In his infancy, he will receive and comprehend so much information that studying—again, as you understand it—would simply be silly. It would be like sending a great mathematician to study in first grade.</p><p>"You will want to bring the baby some pointless toy, but he absolutely doesn't need it.</p><p>"You need it for your own satisfaction: 'What a good and concerned person I am!' If you think you're creating good by providing your son with a car or something else you consider worthwhile, but if he wants something, he'll be able to obtain it himself.</p><p>"Think calmly, Vladimir. What concrete and important thing could you tell your son? What could you teach him? What have you done in life that would interest him?"</p><p>She continued speaking in a gentle, calm voice, but her words made me tremble.</p><p>"You have to understand, Vladimir. When he starts making sense of the universe, you will seem like an underdeveloped being next to him. Do you really want this? Do you really want your son to see his father as a muddlehead?</p><p>"The only thing that can bring you closer is the degree of purity of intentions, but this purity is attainable to very few in your world. You must try to achieve it."</p><p>I realized it was utterly useless to argue with her, and I cried out in despair, "You mean he will never know about me?"</p><p>"I will tell him about you and your world when he is capable of understanding it all consciously and of making decisions. What he'll do, I don't know."</p><p>Despair, pain, insult, and a terrible conjecture were roiling inside me. I felt like striking this beautiful intellectual hermit's face with all my might.</p><p>I understood everything, and I gasped for air at what I had understood.</p><p>"I understand everything! Everything! You ... you had no one to sleep with here in order to conceive a child. You were posing from the very beginning, you manipulative . . . making yourself out to be a nun!</p><p>"You needed a child. You went to Moscow. You sold your nice mushrooms and berries. You should have hustled there, taken off your jacket and kerchief. They would have snapped you up right away, and you wouldn't have woven your web and entangled me. Of course! You needed a man dreaming of a son. And you got what you were after.</p><p>"Were you thinking about a child? A son? Who was foreordained to lived as a hermit? To live the way you believe he should? And to think she was expounding the truth! You're taking on a lot, hermit. What are you, the ultimate truth? Did you ever give me a moment's thought?</p><p>"Yes! I was dreaming of a son! Dreaming of passing my business on to him, teaching him business. I wanted to love him. How am I supposed to live now? Live and know that your tiny son is crawling around in the remote taiga somewhere defenseless—without a future, without a father. Yes, this breaks my heart. You wouldn't understand that, you forest bitch."</p><p>"Maybe your heart will become sensible and everything will be fine? That kind of pain will cleanse the soul, quicken the thought, call you to create." Anastasia spoke softly.</p><p>But fury was storming inside me, the kind of rage that . . . I lost control. I grabbed a stick. I ran away from Anastasia and started beating the stick against a small tree with all my might until the stick broke.</p><p>Then I turned toward a standing Anastasia and, as soon as I saw her, incredibly, my rage began to subside. I thought, "Why did I lose control of myself again and fly into a rage?"</p><p>As she had the last time I'd cursed her, Anastasia stood there, pressed to a tree, her arm raised and her head bowed, as if she were withstanding a hurricane-force wind.</p><p>No longer angry at all, I approached her and began examining her. Now her arms were pressed to her chest, her body was trembling lightly, and she was silent. Only her good, always good eyes were watching me tenderly. We stood there like that for a while, examining each other. I thought, "Without a doubt, she is incapable of telling a lie."</p><p>She didn't have to tell me all this, after all, but she did.</p><p>She knew it would be bad for her, but she said it. Of course, this was an extreme, too. You couldn't survive speaking only the truth all the time, only what you thought. But what was to be done if she was like that and could not be different?</p><p>Everything came to pass just as it did. What happened, happened. Now she was going to be the mother of my son.</p><p>She was going to be a mother, as she said.</p><p>Of course, she would be a strange mother. Her way of life . . . her thinking . . . But there was nothing to be done for it.</p><p>On the other hand, she was very strong physically. And good. She knew nature and animals well. And she was smart, although her intellect was unique.</p><p>Still, she knew a lot about raising children. All the time she so wanted to talk about children. She would nurse our son. A woman like that would nurse him. She would get him through the hard frosts and blizzards. They were nothing to her. She would nurse him and raise him.</p><p>I had to adapt to the situation somehow. I would visit them in the summer, as if it were my dacha. In winter, that would be impossible. I couldn't take it. But in the summer I would play with my son. He would grow up and I would tell him about the people in the big cities. But right now I did have to apologize to her.</p><p>"Forgive me, Anastasia. My nerves got the better of me again."</p><p>She began speaking immediately.</p><p>"It's not your fault. Just don't curse yourself. Don't be upset. You were concerned about your son. You were upset that he would have a bad time of it. That your son's mother was like an ordinary bitch and didn't know how to love with a real, human love. Just don't worry, Vladimir. Don't get upset. You said that because you didn't know, you didn't know anything about my love, my beloved."</p>

<p>"Anastasia, if you're so intelligent and omnipotent, does that mean you might help me, too?"</p><p>She looked up at the sky and back at me.</p><p>"There is no creature in the entire Universe capable of developing more powerfully than man or of having more freedom. All other civilizations bow down before man. All the various civilizations can develop and improve in only one direction, and they aren't free. They can't even begin to understand man's greatness. God—the Great Reason—created man and gave no one more than him."</p><p>I couldn't understand—or, rather, immediately comprehend—what she said. Again, I asked the same question, asking about help without myself understanding the specific help I wanted.</p><p>She asked, "What do you have in mind? For me to heal all your physical ailments? That's easy for me. I did that six months ago, only no benefit was gained in the main thing, and what is pernicious and dark in people of your world did not diminish in you. Your little aches and pains will try to come back.</p><p>"'Witch! Crazy hermit lady! I need to get out of here as fast I can'—that's what you were thinking right now, am I right?"</p><p>"Yes," I replied, surprised. "That's exactly what I was thinking. Are you reading my mind?"</p><p>"I guess what you might think. It's written all over your face. Tell me, Vladimir, do you really not . . . well, remember me even a little?"</p><p>Her question surprised me greatly, and I started examining the features of her face more closely. Her eyes—I really did start to think I might have seen them somewhere. But where?</p><p>"Anastasia, you yourself said you've lived in the forest all this time. How could I have seen you?"</p><p>She smiled and ran away.</p><p>After a while Anastasia emerged from the bushes wearing her long skirt and brown buttoned top, with her hair gathered up under her kerchief, but without the jacket she'd been wearing on the shore when we met. The kerchief was tied a little differently. The clothing she wore was clean but unfashionable. The kerchief covered her forehead and neck. And I remembered her.</p>

<h2>25. An Odd Young Woman</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************</br><img src=http://ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/strange-young-woman-vk.com-kumar82.jpg>
</div>
<p>Last year, the caravan's ship had tied up at a village not far from these parts. We'd had to buy meat for the restaurant and were detained on shore for a while.</p><p>Sixty kilometers away began a dangerous stretch of the river that would not allow the ship to move at night (the navigational lights weren't operating on some stretches of the river). So as not to waste this time, we started making announcements over our outside loudspeaker and the local radio about an upcoming evening of entertainment on the ship.</p><p>The white ship at the shore twinkling with so many lights and the music pouring from it always attracted the local youth. This time, too, nearly the entire young population of the village lined up for the gangway.</p><p>First, like everyone who steps on deck for the first time, they rushed to go around and see everything. After crossing the main, middle, and upper decks, they ultimately clustered in the bar and restaurant.</p><p>The female half, as a rule, danced, and the male half tended to drink. The unusual situation on the ship plus the music and alcohol always put them in an excited state that sometimes caused the crew quite a bit of trouble. Almost always they didn't have enough time and a collective request would begin to extend their pleasure for just a half-hour, then more and more.</p><p>That time I found myself alone in my cabin, and I heard the music coming from the restaurant. I was trying to readjust the caravan's upcoming itinerary. All of a sudden I felt someone staring at me. I turned around and saw her eyes through my window.</p><p>There was nothing surprising in that. Visitors were always interested in looking into the cabins on the ship. I stood up and opened the window. She didn't go away. Embarrassed, she kept looking at me.</p><p>I felt like doing something for this woman standing all alone on the deck. I thought, "Why isn't she dancing like the others? Might she have known some misfortune?"</p><p>I offered to show her the ship and she nodded in silence. I led her around the ship and showed her the office, whose elegant furnishings always amazed visitors: the rug covering the floor, the soft leather furniture, the computers. Then I invited her to my cabin, which consisted of a bedroom-cum-office and a sitting room decorated with rugs and magnificent furniture, a television, and a video player. At the time, it probably gave me pleasure to impress this intimidated village girl with the achievements of civilized daily life.</p><p>Thinking I would completely wow her with my chic, I opened a box of candies for her, poured two goblets of champagne, and turned on a video of Vika Tsyganova singing "Love and Death." There were other songs as well on the cassette, performed by my favorite singers. She took the barest of sips of champagne, watched me closely, and asked, "It's been very hard, hasn't it?"</p><p>I'd expected all sorts of things, only not that question.</p><p>The journey had indeed been hard. We'd had difficulty navigating the river, and the crew of sailors, cadets from the river institute, were smoking grass and pilfering the store.</p><p>We were often behind schedule and couldn't get to the settlements where announcements had been made about the caravan's arrival by the scheduled time. The burden of these and other cares often gave me no chance to admire the riverbank landscape or simply get a good night's sleep.</p><p>I said something absurd to her, like, "It's all right. We'll get through," turned toward the window, and drank my champagne.</p><p>She and I talked about something else, listened to the video, and talked until the ship docked at the shore at the end of our pleasure cruise. Then I saw her to the gangway. Returning to my cabin, I noted to myself that there was something odd and unusual in that woman, and I was left with a light and bright feeling after being with her. That night, for the first time in many days, I got a good night's sleep. Now I realized that the woman on the ship was Anastasia.</p><p>"So that was you, Anastasia?"</p><p>"Yes. There, in your cabin, and I memorized all the songs I sang for you in the forest. They were playing while we were talking. Do you see how simple it all is?"</p><p>"How did you come to be on the ship?"</p><p>"I was interested in how all this happens with you, how you live. After all, Vladimir, I've always dealt only with summer people. That day I ran to the village, sold the dried mushrooms the squirrels had gathered, and bought a ticket for your pleasure cruise. Now I know a lot about the category of people you call entrepreneurs, and now I know you well.</p><p>"I am very, very guilty before you. I didn't know it would work out this way, that I would change your destiny so greatly. Only there's nothing I can do, since they determined to carry out this plan and they are subject only to God. Now you and your family will have to overcome great hardships and adversities for a while, and then it will all pass."</p><p>While still not understanding what specifically Anastasia was talking about, I sensed intuitively that something was being revealed to me that went beyond the usual notions of our existence and that this something would affect me directly.</p><p>I asked Anastasia to tell me in greater detail what she meant talking about the changes in my destiny and the hardships. Listening to her, I could not have guessed how precisely what she predicted would come to pass in real life. In her story, Anastasia once again took me back to the events of the year before.</p><p>"Then, on the ship, you showed me everything, even your cabin, you treated me to candies, offered me champagne, and then escorted me to the gangway, but I didn't leave right away. I stood on shore near some bushes, and through the bar's shining windows I could see the local youth dancing and having fun there.</p><p>"You'd shown me everything but hadn't taken me to the bar. I guessed why. I was dressed inappropriately. I was wrapped up in a kerchief, my top was unfashionable, and my skirt was very long. But I could have taken off the kerchief. My top was neat and clean, and I had smoothed my skirt with my hands carefully on my way to see you."</p><p>I actually hadn't taken Anastasia to the bar that evening because of her rather odd clothing, under which, as had now become clear, this young woman was concealing extraordinary beauty that made her stand out sharply next to anyone else. I said, "Anastasia, why did you need that bar? Would you have danced there in your galoshes? And how would you have known the dances of today's youth?"</p><p>"I wasn't wearing galoshes then. When I exchanged the mushrooms for money to buy a ticket to your ship, I borrowed shoes from that woman, old shoes, it's true, and they were tight on me, but I cleaned them with grass. And dancing . . . I just need one little peek, that's all. And how I can dance."</p><p>"Did I insult you?"</p><p>"No. Only if you'd gone to the bar with me, I don't know whether this is good or bad, but events might have developed differently, and such a thing would probably not have occurred. But now I don't regret that what happened happened."</p><p>"So what happened? What so terrible happened?"</p><p>"After you saw me off you didn't return to your cabin right away. First you stopped in to see the captain, and the two of you headed for the bar. For you, this was an ordinary event. When you walked in, you immediately made an impression on the crowd. The captain was wearing his uniform, tightly belted. You were the famous Megre, altogether elegant and outwardly respectable, well known to many on shore—the owner of a caravan that was unusual for people around these parts. You realized full well that you were making an impression on the people around you.</p><p>"You sat down at a table with three young women from the village. They were all of eighteen and had just graduated from high school. They immediately brought your table champagne, candies, and new wineglasses that were better and handsomer than the ones that had been there before.</p><p>"You took one of the girls by the hand, leaned toward her, and started saying something into her ear, and I realized this was what's called 'compliments.' Then you danced with her a few times, talking the whole time. The girls' eyes were shining. It was as if she were in another, fairytale world.</p><p>"You took her out on deck and showed the girl the ship, as you had me, brought her to your cabin, and treated her to the same things as you had me, champagne and candies. You behaved a little differently with the young woman than you had with me. You were cheerful. With me you were serious and even sad, but with her you were cheerful. I could see this well through the shining windows of your cabin, and maybe then I wished a little I could be in that girl's place."</p><p>"You're saying you were jealous, Anastasia?"</p><p>"I don't know. It was an unfamiliar emotion for me."</p><p>I recalled that evening and those young village girls trying so hard to look older and more modern.</p><p>In the morning the ship's captain and I laughed again at their nocturnal escapade. At the time, in the cabin, I realized the girl was in such a state that she was prepared for anything. But I had no thought of taking her. I told Anastasia this, to which she replied, "You still took her heart. You went out on deck, there was a fine rain, and you threw your jacket over the girl's shoulders and then brought her back to the bar."</p><p>"Do you mean to say, Anastasia, you were standing in the bushes, in the rain, the whole time?"</p><p>"That's all right. It was a fine rain, gentle. It just hampered my view. And I didn't want my skirt and kerchief to get wet. They were my mama's. I inherited them from my mama. But I was very lucky. I found a cellophane bag on shore. I took them off, put them in the bag, and hid them under my top."</p><p>"Anastasia, if you hadn't gone home and it had started to rain, you could have come back to the ship."</p><p>"No, I couldn't. You'd seen me off and you had other concerns. It was all winding up anyway.</p><p>"When the time came for the evening to end and the ship was supposed to leave, at the girls' request, and mainly at the request of the girl who had been with you, you held the ship back. Everything was in your power then, including their hearts, and you were drunk on that power. The local youth were grateful to the girls, who also felt endowed with power through you. They had forgotten all about the young men who were in the same bar and with whom they had been friends since school.</p><p>"You and the captain escorted them to the gangway. You went back to your cabin. The captain went up on the bridge, and the ship blew its whistle and slowly, very slowly, began casting off. The girl you had danced with stood on shore among her girlfriends and the local boys seeing the ship off. Her little heart was beating so hard, it was as if it were trying to burst from her chest and fly away, and her thoughts and feelings were confused.</p><p>"Behind her were the black outlines of the village houses with their extinguished lights, and in front of her the white ship was pulling away from shore forever, its many lights burning, generously pouring music over the water and the nighttime shore. You were on that departing white ship, you, who had said all those beautiful words she had never heard before, bewitching and tempting words. And all this was moving away from her, slowly and forever.</p><p>"Then she got her nerve up and in front of everyone . . . The young woman made a fist and shouted desperately, 'I love you, Vladimir!' Then again and again. Did you hear those cries?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"It was impossible not to hear them, and the men from your crew heard them, too. Some of them came out on deck and laughed at the young woman."</p><p>"I didn't want them to laugh at the girl. After a while, as if realizing something, they stopped laughing."</p><p>"But you didn't come out on deck, and the ship kept moving slowly away. She thought you couldn't hear her, and she kept shouting, persistently, 'I love you, Vladimir!' Then her girlfriends started helping her, and they shouted together. I was curious to know what this feeling was, love, that made man lose control of himself, or maybe I wanted to help the young woman, and I shouted along with them. 'I love you, Vladimir!'</p><p>"At that moment, I actually forgot that I can't just say words, that they have to have feelings behind them, a consciousness and authenticity of natural information. Now I know how strong that feeling is. And not all that subject to reason, either.</p><p>"That village girl started pining away and drinking, and I had a hard time helping her. Now she's married and immersed in daily cares. And I've had to add to my own and her love."</p><p>The story of the young woman disturbed me a little. Anastasia's story resurrected in detail my memory of that evening. Everything truly had happened as she said. It was real.</p><p>Anastasia's unique declaration of love made no impression on me then. Now that I'd seen her way of life and become familiar with her world-view, she'd begun to seem rather unreal, even though she was sitting beside me and I could easily reach out and touch her. My awareness, accustomed to using other criteria for evaluation, did not perceive her as an existing reality. If at the beginning of our encounter I'd been drawn to her, now she no longer evoked the former emotions.</p><p>"You mean to say you consider the appearance of these new feelings in you coincidental?"</p><p>"They're desired and important," Anastasia replied. "They're even pleasant, but I wanted you to love me the same way. I realized that when you knew me and my world a little more closely, you wouldn't be able to perceive me as an ordinary person, you might even be afraid sometimes. And that is what happened. I'm the one to blame. I made many mistakes. For some reason I was agitated the whole time. I rushed and didn't manage to explain. It all ended up rather foolishly, didn't it? Am I right? Do I need to reform?"</p><p>At these words, she gave the merest sad smile, touched her own chest, and I was immediately reminded of the event of that morning, when I had been with Anastasia.</p>

<h2>26. Bugs</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************</br>
</div>
<p>That morning, I had decided to perform Anastasia's morning routine with her. At first everything was going fine. I stood under the tree a touched different shoots. She told me about the herbs, and then I lay down beside her on the grass. We were completely naked, but even I wasn't cold, perhaps, of course, because she and I had been running through the forest together. A magnificent mood, I felt a kind of lightness, and not just physical, it seemed to be inside me. It all started when I felt a tingling on my thigh. I raised my head and saw bugs of some kind, ants and, I think, beetles, on my thigh and leg. I gave a swipe to slap them, but missed.</p><p>Anastasia grabbed my hand and held it. "Don't touch them," she said.</p><p>Then she knelt before me, bowed, and pressed my second hand to the ground. I lay there as if crucified. I tried to free my hands, but nothing doing. It felt impossible. Then I gave a jerk, exerting quite a bit of effort. She restrained me without especially tensing, even smiling all the while. On my body, I felt more and more crawling, prickling, biting, and tingling bugs and I concluded they were starting to eat me up. I was in her hands literally and figuratively, and I assessed the situation. No one knew where I was. No one was going to wander in here. And if they did, they would see my gnawed bones, if they saw any bones at all. All sorts of things flashed through my brain then, and on the basis of all that, probably, my instinct for self-preservation suggested the sole possible solution. With all my strength and desperation I bit Anastasia's bared breast and at the same time shook my head from side to side. I unclenched my teeth as soon as she cried out. Anastasia let me go, jumped up, held her breast with one hand, and waved upward with the other, trying to smile. I jumped up, too, and shouted at her, feverishly shaking the crawlers off me.</p><p>"You wanted to feed me to those vipers, you forest witch, and I won't give in so easily!"</p><p>Still waving and trying with all her might to smile to everything standing guard all around, Anastasia looked at me and walked slowly to her lake, not at her usual run, her head lowered. I stood there a little longer, trying to figure out what to do now. Return to the river? But how would I find my way? Follow Anastasia? But why? Nonetheless I went to the lake.</p><p>Anastasia was sitting on the shore rubbing some herb in her palms and squeezing its juice on her breast where you could see the huge bruise from my bite. It must have hurt. But what was her purpose in holding me down? For a while I shifted from foot to foot in silence, and then I asked, "Does it hurt?"</p><p>Without turning her head, she replied, "It hurts my feelings more." Silently, she continued to squeeze the herb juice.</p><p>"Why did you think to play a joke like that on me?"</p><p>"I wanted what was best. The pores of your skin are all plugged up. They don't breathe at all. The little bugs would have cleaned them out. It's not that painful, it actually feels good."</p><p>"And the snake, it was poking its tongue in my foot?"</p><p>"It wasn't going to do anything bad to you. And if it had released poison, then that would only have been on top, and I would have wiped it away immediately. The skin and muscles on your heel are numb."</p><p>"That's from an accident," I said.</p><p>We were silent for a while. It was a foolish situation. Not knowing what to say, I asked, "How come someone, that invisible someone, didn't help you like before, when I fainted?"</p><p>"He didn't help because I was smiling. And when you started biting, I tried to smile."</p><p>I felt a little awkward. I snatched up a tuft of grass lying next to me, rubbed it in my palms with all my strength, and then knelt before her and started rubbing her bruise with my wet palms.</p>

<h2>27. Dreams are the Creation of the Future</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************</br>
</div>
<p>Now that I had learned about Anastasia's feelings and her desire to prove that she was a natural and ordinary person, no matter how very unusual she was, I realized the pain I had inflicted on her soul that morning. I apologized to her again, and Anastasia replied that she wasn't angry, but now, after what I'd done, she was afraid for me.</p><p>"How could you have done something so terrible?" I asked, and once more I heard a story that someone wishing to seem as normal as all the people living in our world should not lay out in earnest. Because no one says this about himself.</p><p>"When the ship left," Anastasia continued, "and the local youth headed for the village, I stood on the bank for a while alone, and I felt good. Then I ran into my forest. The day passed as usual, but in the evening, when the stars came out, I lay down on the grass and began to daydream, and that was when I came up with this plan."</p><p>"What plan is that?"</p><p>"You have to understand that what I know is known in part by various people of the world you live in, and taken together they know almost everything, only they don't understand the mechanism completely.</p><p>"That was when I dreamed you would go to a big city and tell many people about me and about what I've explained to you. You would do this using the same methods you usually use to convey all kinds of information there, and you would write a book. Lots and lots of people would read it and the truth would be revealed to them. They would start being sick less, change their attitude toward children, and develop a new method of teaching for them.</p><p>"People would love more and the Earth would emit more light energy. Artists would draw my portrait, and that would be the best they had ever drawn. I would try to inspire them. They would make what you call a movie, and it would be the most beautiful movie ever. You would look at all this and think of me.</p><p>"Scientists would come to see you who would understand and appreciate what I'd told you about, and they would explain a lot to you. You would believe them more than me, and you would understand that I'm no witch but a person, it's just that there is more information inside me than others.</p><p>"What you wrote would arouse great interest, and you would be rich. You would have money in the banks of nineteen countries, and you would make a pilgrimage to holy places and cleanse yourself of all the darkness inside you.</p><p>"You would think of me and love me, and you would want to see me and your son again. You would want to be worthy of your son.</p><p>"My dream was very vivid, but also possibly a little selfish.</p><p>"That is probably why all this happened. They took it as a plan of action and decided to move people across the dark forces' span of time. That could happen if the detailed plan were born on Earth, in the soul and thoughts of an earthly man. They probably perceived the plan as grandiose, and they themselves might have added something to it, so the dark forces powerfully set their work in motion. Nothing like this has ever happened before. I realized this from the ringing cedar. Its ray has become much thicker. And it's ringing even more powerfully now—it's in a hurry to give off its light and energy."</p><p>I listened to Anastasia, and at that moment the thought that she was not normal gained an even greater foothold in me. Maybe she had escaped a long time ago from some hospital and was living here, in the forest, but I had also slept with her. Now a child might be born. Quite a story. Nevertheless, seeing how serious and agitated she was as she spoke, I tried to calm her.</p><p>"Don't worry, Anastasia. Your plan is obviously unfeasible, so there's no reason for the forces of darkness and light to struggle. You don't know enough detail about our ordinary life, its laws and conventions. The problem is that we publish a great many books these days, but people don't buy even the works of famous writers very much. I'm no writer. I don't have the talent, abilities, or education to write anything there."</p><p>"Yes, Vladimir. You didn't have them before, but now you do," Anastasia stated in reply.</p><p>"Fine," I continued to try to reassure her. "Even if I do try, no one is going to publish it or believe in your existence."</p><p>"But I do exist. I exist for those I exist for. They will believe and help you just as I will help them later. And together with those people we will . . ."</p><p>The meaning of her sentence was not clear to me right away, and once again I tried to reassure her.</p><p>"I'm not even going to try to write anything. There's no point. Eventually you'll have to understand that."</p><p>"You will. They have clearly composed an entire system of circumstances that will compel you to do it."</p><p>"What, you think I'm a pawn in someone's hands?"</p><p>"And a lot depends on you. But the dark forces will try to prevent you using every means at their disposal, up to and including pushing you toward suicide and creating the illusion of despair."</p><p>"That's it, Anastasia. I've had enough listening to your fantasies."</p><p>"You think these are fantasies?"</p><p>"Yes! Yes! Fantasies." And I stopped myself short.</p><p>A thought relating to time blazed up in my mind, and I understood. Everything Anastasia had been telling me about her dreams were things she had thought last year, when I still didn't know her as well as I did now and hadn't slept with her. Now, a year later, it had come to pass.</p><p>"So you mean everything's already happening?" I asked her.</p><p>"Naturally. If it hadn't been for them, and a little for me, your second expedition would have been impossible. After all, you were barely making ends meet after the first one, and you no longer had any rights to the ship."</p><p>"You mean you influenced the shipping company, the firms that helped me?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then you ruined me and harmed them. What right do you have to interfere? On top of that, I left the ship and I'm sitting here with you. They could be stealing me blind. You must know how to hypnotize. No, something even worse. You're a witch, full stop. Or a crazy hermit. You have nothing, not even a home, and you're philosophizing here in front of me, you sorceress.</p><p>"I'm an entrepreneur! Do you have any idea what that is? I'm an entrepreneur! I may perish, but my ships are still on the river, bringing people goods. I'm the one supplying them, giving people the goods they need, and I could for you, too. And what can you give me?"</p><p>"Me? What can I give you? I can give you a drop of heavenly kindness and peace. You will be a clear-eyed genius. I am your image."</p><p>"Image? And who needs it, your image? What good comes of that?"</p><p>"It could help you write your book for people."</p><p>"Oh, please! Again with your mysticism!"</p><p>"I never do anything bad to anyone. I couldn't. I'm a human being! If you're so concerned about earthly goods and money, then wait a little longer, and it will all come back to you.</p><p>"I'm guilty before you for dreaming so and because you're going to have a hard time for a while, but somehow nothing else came to mind then. You don't see the logic. You have to be compelled by the circumstances of your world."</p><p>"Oh, please." I couldn't restrain myself. "You mean you're still going to try to force me? You're doing this, but you still want to appear an ordinary human being."</p><p>"I am a human being. A woman!" Anastasia was agitated, as was evident from the way she exclaimed, "I have only wanted what is good and light. I want you to be cleansed. That's why I came up with the idea then of a pilgrimage to holy places and a book. They accepted it, and the dark forces are always struggling with them, but they never win on the main thing."</p><p>"Are you telling me that with your intellect, information, and energy you're going to stand on the sidelines as an observer?"</p><p>"Given the degree of conflict between the two great principles, the effect from my efforts is insignificantly small. Help is needed from many others from your world. I'm going to search for them and find them, the way I did when you were in the hospital. Only you have to get a little more conscious yourself, too. Fight what is indecent in yourself."</p><p>"What is so awful about me, what bad thing did I do in the hospital? And how did you heal me if you weren't there?"</p><p>"At the time you simply didn't sense my presence, but I was by your side. When I was on the ship, I brought you the branch from the ringing cedar that my mama had broken off before she died. I left it in your cabin when you invited me there. You were already sick then. I could tell. Do you remember the branch?"</p><p>"Yes," I replied. "The branch really did hang in my cabin for a long time. Many of the crew saw it. I took it to Novosibirsk. But I didn't lend it any significance."</p><p>"You just threw it out."</p><p>"I didn't know."</p><p>"That's right. You didn't know. You threw it out. And my mama's branch didn't have time to vanquish your disease. Then you lay in the hospital. When you get back, take a close look at your case history. You'll see on the chart that although they used the very best medicine, there was no improvement. But later they brought you cedar nut oil. The doctor, who followed medical protocols strictly, shouldn't have done it, but he did what does not exist in a single one of your medical prescription manuals and has actually never been done at all. Do you remember?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"You were treated by the woman who is in charge of one of the best clinics in your city. But her department has no connection with your ailment. She kept you there, even though one floor up in the same building was the department for your ailment. Right?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"She stuck needles in you, turning on music in the half-dark room while she was doing it."</p><p>Anastasia was saying everything that had in fact happened to me.</p><p>"Do you remember that woman?"</p><p>"Yes. She was in charge of the former provincial party hospital."</p><p>All of a sudden Anastasia, looking at me seriously, said a few snatches of sentences that struck me immediately and even sent a shiver through my body. "What kind of music do you like? . . . Good. . . . Like this? It's not too loud? " She said those sentences in the voice and intonation of the doctor who had treated me.</p><p>"Anastasia!" I exclaimed.</p><p>She interrupted me.</p><p>"Keep listening, for God's sake, and don't be so surprised. Please try, try at last to understand what I'm telling you. Rouse your intellect just a little. All this so far is very simple for man."</p><p>She continued.</p><p>"This woman doctor, she is very good. She is a real doctor. I got along easily with her. She is good and open. It was I who didn't want you moved to a different department. The other was profiled for your ailment and hers wasn't. But she said to her superiors, 'Leave him here and I'll heal him.' She sensed she could. She knew your ailments were merely a consequence of 'the other.' And she tried to fight that 'other.' She was a doctor.</p><p>"And how did you behave? You continued to smoke, drank whatever you wanted, ate spicy and salty food, and all this despite a bad ulcer. You denied yourself nothing, no pleasures whatsoever. Somewhere in your subconscious it set in, though you yourself have no suspicion, that you're not afraid of anything and nothing will happen to you. I did nothing good. The opposite, more than likely. The darkness in your consciousness did not diminish, but consciousness and will did not increase either. When you were well, you sent your employee to wish her, the woman who saved your life, a happy holiday, and you yourself never called her even once. She was waiting for that, she loved you like . . ."</p><p>"She or you, Anastasia?"</p><p>"We, if that's more understandable to you."</p><p>I stood up and, not knowing why, took a couple of steps away from Anastasia, who was sitting on a fallen tree. A mixture of feelings and thoughts had given rise to increasing vagueness in my attitude toward her.</p><p>"Once again you don't understand how I can do this. You're frightened. But it's easy to guess that I do it with my imagination and by accurately analyzing all the possible situations. And once again, you thought I—"</p><p>She fell silent and bowed her head over her knees. I stood in silence and thought, "Why does she keep saying all these unbelievable things? She says them and gets upset that they're incomprehensible. Evidently she doesn't understand that no normal person could accept them, and consequently her, as normal."</p><p>Then I did walk up to Anastasia and brushed aside the lock of hair that had fallen on her face. Tears slipped from Anastasia's big, gray-blue eyes. She smiled and said something unlike her: "What a woman, right? Right now you're amazed by the very fact of my existence and can't believe your eyes. You don't believe completely and can't grasp what I'm telling you. The fact of my existence and my abilities seem astonishing to you. You've completely ceased to perceive me as a normal human being, and believe me, Vladimir, I'm a human being and no witch.</p><p>"You consider my way of life astonishing, but why doesn't the other seem astonishing and paradoxical? Why do people, who deem the Earth a cosmic body, the greatest creation of the Supreme Reason, each process of which is His greatest achievement, torment and put such effort into damaging it? A man-made spaceship or airplane seems natural to you, but that entire piece of equipment is made from the broken and smelted parts of the greatest living natural mechanism.</p><p>"Imagine a being who smashes up a flying airplane to make himself a hammer or scraper from the parts and is proud if his primitive tool works out. That being doesn't understand that you can't go on smashing an airplane indefinitely. How can you not understand that you can't torment our Earth like that?</p><p>"The computer is considered a triumph of reason, but few suspect that a computer is like a brain prosthesis. Can you imagine what would happen to a person if he used crutches while having normal legs? The muscles of his legs would atrophy, of course. A machine can never surpass a human brain that's constantly in training."</p><p>Anastasia wiped away the tear slipping down her cheek with the palm of her hand and once again continued persistently to set forth her incredible conclusions.</p><p>At the time, I could not have guessed that everything she said would excite many people and rouse scientists' minds and even as a hypothesis would have no analog in the world.</p><p>According to Anastasia, the Sun is something like a mirror. It reflects the emanation, invisible to the eye, that comes from the Earth. This emanation comes from people who are in a state of love, joy, and certain other emotions of light. Reflected off the Sun, they return to Earth in the form of sunlight and give life to everything earthly.</p><p>She cited a number of arguments, although they were not that easy to understand.</p><p>"If the Earth and the other planets used only the grace of the Sun's light," she said, "the Sun would go out, burn unevenly, and its illumination would not be uniform. There is no unilateral process in the Universe, nor could there be. Everything is interrelated."</p><p>She also took words from the Bible: "And the life was the light of men."</p><p>Anastasia also said that feelings were transmitted from one person to another by reflecting off cosmic bodies. She demonstrated this with an example.</p><p>"None one living on Earth can deny that he can feel when someone loves him. This feeling is more palpable when you're next to the person who loves you. You call this intuition. In fact, invisible waves of light emanate from the person who loves you. But even when that person is not nearby, if his love is strong, it is also palpable. With the help of this feeling, by understanding its nature, you can work miracles. This is what you call miracles, mysticism, or incredible abilities. Tell me, Vladimir, did you just feel a little better with me? Lighter, warmer, fuller?"</p><p>"Yes," I replied. "For some reason I felt warmer."</p><p>"Now look what happens to you when I focus even more on you."</p><p>Anastasia lowered her eyelashes slightly, slowly took a few steps back, and stopped. A pleasant warmth flooded my body. It intensified but didn't burn. It wasn't too hot.</p><p>Anastasia turned and began to move away slowly, hiding behind the thick trunk of a tall tree. The pleasant warmth did not diminish, but something new was added. It was as if something were helping my heart drive the blood through my veins, and now with each beat I had the impression that streams of blood were instantly reaching every vein in my body. I broke out in a heavy sweat, and my feet became wet.</p><p>"There, you see? Now do you understand it all?" a triumphant Anastasia said as she emerged from behind the tree, confident she had proven something. "After all, you did feel when I went behind the tree's trunk, and our feelings even intensified when you didn't see me. Tell me about them."</p><p>I told her and then asked, "What does the tree trunk prove?"</p><p>"What do you mean? The waves of information and light were going straight from me to you. When I hid, the tree trunk should have distorted them powerfully, since it has its own information and illumination, but that didn't happen.</p><p>"The waves of feeling fell on you, reflected off cosmic bodies, and even intensified. Then I performed what you call a miracle. Your feet began to sweat. You hid that from me."</p><p>"I didn't think it was important. What's the miracle in feet sweating?"</p><p>"I drove all kinds of ailments out of your organism through your feet. You should be feeling much better now. Even outwardly it's noticeable. You're less round-shouldered."</p><p>Indeed, I did feel better physically.</p><p>"You mean you concentrate like that, you dream, and you get what you want?"</p><p>"More or less."</p><p>"And this always works for you, even when you dream of something other than healing?"</p><p>"Always. Unless it's an abstract dream. If it's detailed down to the smallest events and doesn't contradict the laws of spiritual being. That kind of dream can't always be constructed. Your thoughts have to go very, very fast, and there have to be the corresponding vibration of feelings. Then it will definitely come to pass. This is natural. This happens to many in their life. Ask people you know. You may find among them those who have dreamed something and that dream has come true, either wholly or in part."</p><p>"The details and my thoughts have to race very fast. Tell me, when you dreamed of poets, artists, and the book, did you detail those? Did you think your thoughts fast?"</p><p>"Extraordinarily fast. And all specifically, in the tiniest detail."</p><p>"And now, do you think it will come true?"</p><p>"Yes, I do."</p><p>"Were you dreaming of anything else then? Have you told me everything about your dreams?"</p><p>"No, I haven't."</p><p>"Then tell me everything."</p><p>"You . . . You want to hear what I have to say, Vladimir? Is that true?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Anastasia's face beamed, as if illuminated by a flash of light. Inspired and excited, she launched into her incredible monologue.</p>

<h2>28. Across the Dark Forces' Span of Time</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************</br>
</div>
<p>"On that night of dreamings, I thought about how to move people across the dark forces' span of time. My plan and awareness were precise and real, and they approved.</p><p>"The book you write will contain unobtrusive combinations and letter formulations that will give rise in most people to feelings of goodness and light. These feelings can fight physical and emotional ailments and will facilitate the birth of the new awareness intrinsic to the people of the future. Believe me, Vladimir. This is not hocus-pocus. This corresponds to the laws of the Universe.</p><p>"It's all very simple. You will write the book and be guided exclusively by your feelings and soul. Otherwise you won't be able because you don't have the writing skills. However, with feelings you can do anything.</p><p>"These feelings are already inside you. Both mine and yours. You're still unaware of them. They will be understood by many. Embodied in symbols and combinations, they will be more powerful than Zoroastrian fire.</p><p>"Hide nothing that has happened to you, even what you treasure most. Emancipate yourself from any shame and don't be afraid to be ridiculous. Make peace with your pride.</p><p>"I revealed myself to you entirely—body and soul. Through you, I want to reveal myself to all people, and now this has been allowed me.</p><p>"I know the mass of dark forces that will come crashing down on me and resist my dream, but I'm not afraid of them. I'm stronger and will live to see what I have conceived.</p><p>"And I will live to give birth to and raise my son—our son, Vladimir.</p><p>"My dream will break many mechanisms of the dark forces, which have had a pernicious effect on people for millennia, and will compel many to work for good.</p><p>"I know you can't believe me right now. The conventions and many postulates engendered in your brain by the preconceptions of your world's existence act as an obstacle for you.</p><p>"The possibility of time travel seems an unlikely possibility to you. But your concepts of time and distance are relative. It is the degree of consciousness and will, not the second and meter, that characterize these dimensions. The purity of the intentions, emotions, and feelings characteristic of the majority determines the point in the Universe and time where humanity is.</p><p>"You believe in horoscopes and in your total dependence on the disposition of the planets. This belief was achieved through the mechanisms of the dark forces. This belief slows the time of the parallel of light and gives the parallel of darkness a chance to move forward and grow bigger. This belief is leading you away from an awareness of the truth and the essence of your earthly existence.</p><p>"You have to analyze this carefully. Just think. God created man in His image and likeness. Man has been given the greatest freedom, the freedom to choose between the darkness and the light. Man has been given a Soul. Everything visible is in man's power, and man is at liberty—even with respect to God—whether to love Him or not. No one and nothing can govern man against his will. God wants man's love in exchange for His own, but God wants the love of a free man who is perfect and resembles Him.</p><p>"God created everything visible, including the planets, which provide order and harmony for every living thing—the plant and the animal worlds—and help the human flesh, but they absolutely do not govern man's soul or reason. Neither the planets nor the stars direct man, rather through his subconscious, man moves all the planets. If one man wanted a second Sun to blaze up in the sky, it wouldn't. Things are arranged to prevent a planetary disaster. But if all people simultaneously wanted a second Sun, it would appear.</p><p>"Compiling a horoscope requires, above all, taking into consideration the basic parameters: the man's level of temporal awareness, the strength of his will and spirit, the aspirations of his Soul, and the degree of its participation in the moment of present daily life. Favorable and unfavorable days, magnetic storms, and high and low pressure are freely vanquished by the will and consciousness. Haven't you ever seen a happy and joyful man on an overcast day or in bad weather or, on the contrary, a sad, depressed man on the most propitious sunny day?</p><p>"You think I’m fantasizing like a crazy woman when I talk about how the letter combinations and formulations I place in the book will heal and enlighten people. You don't believe me because you don't understand. But in fact it's very simple.</p><p>"Here I am right now speaking your language, trying to use your turns of phrase and even intonations. It will be easy for you to remember what I've said because this is your language, inherent to you alone, but also understood by many people. It contains no incomprehensible words or rare idioms. It's simple and therefore understandable to the majority.</p><p>"But I'm changing it just a little, maybe introducing a few words, just a little bit. You're in an agitated state right now, so when you remember this state you'll remember everything I told you, and you'll write down what I've said. That is how my letter combinations will wind up in the book you write.</p><p>"They are very important. They could work miracles, like prayer. After all, many of you already know that prayers are specific combinations of specific letters. These combinations have been constructed by enlightened men with God's help.</p><p>"The dark forces were always trying to take away man's ability to make use of the grace emanating from these combinations. For this, they even changed the language, introduced new words and removed old ones, and distorted meaning.</p><p>"Previously, for example, your language had forty-seven letters; now there are only thirty-three left. The dark forces introduced other combinations and formulas of their own, stirring up what is base and dark, and tried to distract man with carnal desires and passions. But I brought the primordialness of the combinations to the fore using only today's letters and symbols, and they will now be effective.</p><p>"I worked so hard to find them! And I did it! I gathered and collected all that was best from different times. I collected a lot. I concealed them in what you will write. As you see, this is simply a translation of a combinations of signs from the depths of eternity and the infinity of the Cosmos, precise in meaning, significance, and purpose.</p><p>"You must write about everything you've seen and hide nothing—not the bad, not the good, not the cherished—and then they will be preserved. You will be convinced of this yourself, please believe me, Vladimir. You will be when you write it.</p><p>"In many who read what you are going to write, feelings and emotions will arise that they still do not understand or grasp completely. They will tell you this. You'll see and hear them tell you this. And they will have feelings of light, and later many themselves will understand with the help of these feelings a lot more than you will have written.</p><p>"Just write a little. When you are convinced that people are feeling these combinations. When ten, a hundred, a thousand people tell you this. Then you'll believe it and write it all. Just believe. Believe in yourself. Believe in me.</p><p>"In the future I'll be able to tell you something even more important, and they will understand and feel it.</p><p>"But even more significant is the rearing of children. You were interested in knowing about saucers and mechanisms, rockets and planets. And I so wanted to tell you more about raising children, and I will, I will tell you this when I've planted more consciousness in you.</p><p>"However, you need to read this when the sounds of man-made, artificial mechanisms aren't getting in the way. These sounds harm man and lead him away from the truth. Let the sounds of the natural world created by God remain. They bear the information of truth and grace, and they help your consciousness. Then the healing will be much more powerful.</p><p>"Once again, of course, you doubt and don't believe in the healing power of the word. You're thinking that I . . . But there is no hocus-pocus or fantasy in this whatsoever, nothing that contradicts the laws of spiritual existence. When feelings of light appear in man, they have to have a favorable influence on absolutely all the bodily organs. The feelings of light are the most powerful and effective means for countering any illness. God healed with the help of these kinds of feelings, and so did the saints. Read the Old Testament and you'll be convinced yourself. Some people of your world can also heal with the help of these feelings. Many of your doctors know about this. Ask them, if you don't believe me. After all, it's easier for you to believe them. The stronger and lighter this feeling, the greater its effect on the person to whom it is directed.</p><p>"I could always heal with my ray. When I was a child, my great-grandfather taught and explained it all to me. I've done this many times with my summer people. Right now my ray is many times stronger than my grandfather's and great-grandfather's. They say this is because the feeling called love has appeared in me. It is very big and pleasant, and it burns a little. I would like to give it to everyone and to you. I would like everyone to feel good and everything to be good, the way God intended."</p><p>Anastasia had delivered her monologue with extraordinary inspiration and certainty, as if she had shot it into space and time. Then she fell silent.</p><p>I looked at Anastasia, stunned by her unusual fervor and certainty, and asked, "Anastasia, is that all? Are there no more nuances to your plans, your dream?"</p><p>"The rest of the details are trivial, Vladimir. Inconsequential. I created them in passing, as easily as two times two. There was just one complication that concerned you, but I've solved it."</p><p>"Please tell me in more detail. What was the complication that concerned me?"</p><p>"You have to understand. I've made you the richest man on Earth. I've also made you the most famous. This will happen in a little while. But when the dream was being specified, before it had taken off, caught up by the forces of light, the dark forces . . . they're always trying to add something harmful of their own—different side effects that ruin those it concerns and various people.</p><p>"My thoughts raced very very fast, but the dark forces caught up anyway. They abandoned many of their earthly affairs and tried to launch their own mechanisms around my dream, and that was when I came up with something. I outwitted them, and I made all their mechanisms work for the good.</p><p>"The forces of darkness were at a loss for less than an instant, but that was enough for my dream, caught up by the forces of light, to race off into the infinity of light, out of the dark forces' reach."</p><p>"What did you come up with, Anastasia?"</p><p>"Unexpectedly for them, I made the dark forces' span of time, during which you will have to overcome various difficulties, a little longer. To do this, I had to deprive myself of the possibility of helping you with my ray. They were perplexed, not seeing any logic in it on my part. Meanwhile, I shone it very very quickly on the people you will be communicating with in the future."</p><p>"What does all this mean?"</p><p>"People will help you and my dream, with their small, almost uncontrollable rays. But there will be lots of them, and together you will make my dream a material reality. You will be transported across the dark forces' span of time, and you will bring others with you.</p><p>"You will not be arrogant and greedy when you're rich and famous because you'll understand that money is not the main thing, that it can never give you warmth or the sincere complicity of a human soul. You will understand this when you go across this span of time and see and meet these people. And they will understand, too."</p><p>"But the bows to the bankers. . . ."</p><p>"Just in case, I devised your relations with the banks as well, because you don't take care of your body at all. At least with the bowing you'll get some exercise when you withdraw money from a bank, and so will some bankers. I don't care if this is a little silly. On the other hand, there will be no sinful pride in you.</p><p>"So it has come to pass that all the difficulties and obstacles the dark forces have come up with in their span of time will temper you and those around you. They will make you more aware and safeguard you later on from the dark temptations they are so proud of. Their very actions will safeguard you, which is why they were at such a loss for a fraction of a second. Now they will never chase down my dream."</p><p>"Anastasia! My sweet dreamer. My fantasizer."</p><p>"Oh! You've done something very fine. Thank you! Thank you. You said it well, 'My sweet.'"</p><p>"You're welcome. But I did also call you a fantasizer. A dreamer. You aren't offended?"</p><p>"Not at all. You still don't know how exactly my dreams always come true when they're vivid and detailed. This one will definitely come true. It is my favorite and most vivid one. And this book will work out. People will find they have unusual feelings and these feelings will summon people to . . ."</p><p>"Wait a minute, Anastasia, You're starting to get carried away again. Calm down."</p><p><div class=section>* * *</div></p><p>Very little time had passed when I cut off Anastasia's fervent speech, which seemed nothing more than a fantasy.</p><p>I didn't quite understand her monologue's meaning. Everything she said seemed too fantastic. Only a year later did the editor of Miracles and Adventures read the manuscript containing that monologue and emotionally present me with the most recent issue of his magazine (May 1996).</p><p>I was gripped by emotion when I read its contents. Two major scientists, Academician Anatoly Akimov and Academician Vlail Kaznacheyev, both spoke in their articles about the existence of a Supreme Reason, the close relationship between man and the Cosmos, and rays that emanate from man but are invisible to ordinary vision. Special instruments were able to register them, and in the journal were two photographs of these rays coming from people. But science had only begun to talk about what Anastasia had not only known since childhood but had simply used in her daily life in her efforts to help people.</p><p>How could I have known a year ago that the woman standing before me wearing her worn and only skirt and clumsy galoshes, fingering the buttons on her top agitatedly, Anastasia, would truly possess tremendous knowledge and the ability to influence human destinies? That her spiritual bursts really were capable of countering what was dark and ruinous for humanity?</p><p>That a folk healer famous in Russia, the chairman of the Russian foundation of healers, would assemble his assistants and say, "We are all bugs before her?" and add that the world had yet to know a power greater than hers. He would regret my long failure to understand her.</p><p>Many would sense an energy of tremendous power emanating from the book.</p><p>Poems would come sprinkling down like spring rain washing away the mud, after publication of the first small print run of the book, whose author, I think, is she.</p><p>Esteemed reader, you are now holding this book in your hands. Reading it. Whether it is summoning up feelings in your soul, only you can judge. What are you feeling? What is it calling you to do?</p><p>Anastasia, left alone there in the taiga, in her glade, will keep using her ray of goodness to dispel the obstacles arising before her dream. She will keep gathering and inspiring more and more new people to make her dream come true.</p><p>Thus, in a difficult moment, three Moscow students would come to stand by my side, without proper monetary compensation for their labor (helping even me materially). Earning money where they could, they—especially Lyosha Novichkov—would spend night after night typing the text of Anastasia on their computers.</p><p>They would not stop typing even when their difficult semester began.</p><p>And Moscow printing press no. 11 would issue a print run of two thousand, bypassing the need for a publisher. Yet even before this, the journalist Evgenia Kvitko from the Peasant Gazette would be the first to talk about Anastasia in the press. Later would come Katya Golovina, from Moscow Pravda, then Forest Gazette, World of News, and Radio Russia. Disdaining tradition, Miracles and Adventures, which published famous luminaries of academic science, would devote several issues to Anastasia and print the following: "In their most daring dreams, academicians have not achieved the insights of Anastasia, the sorceress from the Siberian taiga. Purity of intention makes man omnipotent and omniscient. Man is the pinnacle of creation."</p><p>Only the serious press in the capitals would publish Anastasia. It was as if Anastasia herself chose it, bypassing the tabloids, thus carefully safeguarding the purity of her dream.</p><p>But this became clear only a year after I'd met her, and then, not understanding her, not fully believing her, and relating in a unique way to what had happened, I tried to shift the conversation to a topic closer to me, entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2>29. Strong People</h2>

<p>The highest opinion of you as an individual</p><p>is the opinion held by the people around you.</p><p>Anastasia spoke a lot about the people we call entrepreneurs and their influence on society's spirituality. Then she picked up a twig and drew a circle in the earth. Inside the circle, she drew many more little circles, and in the middle of each of those she put a dot. On either side of this circle, more circles. It was as if she were drawing a map of the planets inside the earthly world and adding a great deal more to it.</p><p>She said, "The big circle is the Earth, the planet people live on. The small circles are small collectives of people who are bound together by something. The points are the people who lead these collectives. Whether or not the people around those leaders are doing well or badly will depend on how these leaders treat the people, what they have them do, and what kind of psychological climate they create through their influence. If the majority are doing well, a light emanation will come from each of them and from the collective as a whole. If they are doing badly, then the emanation is dark."</p><p>She hatched over some of the little circles, making them dark.</p><p>"Of course, many other factors will affect their inner state, but in this span of time, while they're in this collective, the main factor will be their relations with their leader.</p><p>"It is very important for the Universe that light emanate from the Earth as a whole—an emanation of the light of love and good. As the Bible says, 'God is love.' I feel sorry, very sorry, for the people you call entrepreneurs. They are the most unfortunate of all. I so wanted to help them, but it's hard for me to do that alone."</p><p>"You're wrong, Anastasia. We consider the most unfortunate to be the pensioners, people who don't know how to find work and provide themselves with the necessary housing, clothing, and food. An entrepreneur is a person who has all this to a greater degree than others. He has access to pleasures others can't even dream of."</p><p>"What kind, for example?"</p><p>"Well, even if we take the average entrepreneur, he has a modern car and an apartment. He has no problems at all with clothing and food."</p><p>"What about joy? Satisfaction in something? Look."</p><p>Once again Anastasia drew my attention to the grass and, like the first time, when she'd shown me the woman gardener, began showing me other scenes.</p><p>"There, you see? There he is sitting in the car you call stylish. See? He's alone in the back seat, and it's warm and cozy in the car. His experienced chauffeur is driving very smoothly. But look at how tense and pensive the face of the entrepreneur sitting in the back seat is. He's thinking, making plans, he's afraid of something. Look, he's picked up what you call a telephone. He's worried. There! he's received the information. . . . Now he has to assess it quickly and come up with a decision. He's all tense. He's thinking. It's ready, his decision has been made. Now look. Look, he's sitting calmly, apparently, but there is doubt and alarm on his face. No joy at all. Outside his car it's spring, but he neither sees nor feels the spring."</p><p>"It's work, Anastasia."</p><p>"It's a way of life, and there's no break from the moment he wakes up to the moment he falls asleep, and even in his sleep. He doesn't see the budding leaves or the springtime rivulets. He's perpetually surrounded by envious rivals who want to take away what he has. The attempt to wall himself off from them with what you call security and a fortress-like house does not bring complete peace, since the fear and worry are inside him and remain with him always. So it is until he dies, and just before the end of his life he regrets that he had to leave everything behind."</p><p>"The entrepreneur does have joys. They come when he achieves a desired result and carries out a plan he's made."</p><p>"That's not true. He doesn't have time to rejoice in what he's achieved because it's followed by another plan, a more complicated plan, and it all starts in again, only with greater difficulties."</p><p>The forest beauty was drawing me a very gloomy and sad picture about the outwardly prosperous stratum of our society, and I didn't want to believe this picture. I tried to refute her.</p><p>"Anastasia, you forget their ability to achieve the goal they've set and obtain the good things in life, the admiring looks of women, and the respect of those around them."</p><p>"An illusion," she replied. "None of that exists. Where have you seen a respectful or admiring look from someone gazing at the passenger of a stylish car or the owner of the richest dwelling? There's not one person who would confirm what you've said. Those are looks of envy, indifference, and irritation. Even women can't love these men because their emotion is tainted by the desire to possess not only this person, but his property as well. In turn, these men cannot truly love a woman because they can't free up enough space for such a great emotion."</p><p>The search for further arguments was pointless, since what she'd said could only be confirmed or refuted by the people she was talking about. As an entrepreneur myself, I had never given any thought to what Anastasia said, had not analyzed the number of my minutes of joy, and I certainly could not do that for others. Entrepreneurs just don't snivel or complain. Each strives to look successful and content with his life. This is probably why for most people the image of the entrepreneur is someone getting nothing but good things from life.</p><p>Anastasia was picking up not the outward manifestation of feelings but the subtler ones concealed within. She defined man's condition based on how much light she saw. It seemed to me that I could see the scenes and situation she saw more from her voice. I told Anastasia this.</p><p>She replied, "I will help you right now. It's simple. Close your eyes and lie on the grass with your arms out to the sides. You have to relax. Mentally imagine the whole Earth. Try to see its color and the blue glow coming from it. Then narrow your imagination's ray, don't let it take in the whole Earth but make it narrower and narrower until you see specific details. Look for people where there is the most blue light. Narrow your ray even more and you'll see one person or several. Try it again with my help."</p><p>She took my hand and lined her fingers up with mine, resting their tips in my palm. The fingers of her other hand lying in the grass pointed up. Mentally I did everything she said, and there arose before me, though not very distinctly, a scene of three people sitting at a table and conversing excitedly. I couldn't understand what they were saying. I heard no speech of any kind.</p><p>"No," Anastasia said, "these aren't entrepreneurs. We'll find them now."</p><p>She kept leading me on with her ray, going into offices big and small, private clubs, feasts and brothels. The blue glow was either very weak or absent altogether.</p><p>"Look, it's night there already, but he's still sitting alone in his smoke-filled office. Something's not right for this entrepreneur. And this one, look how pleased he is, in a pool, and the girls beside him. He's high, but there's no glow. He's simply trying to forget, and his self-satisfaction is artificial.</p><p>"This one is at home. There's his wife, and his child is asking him something. The telephone rings. There, look, he's serious again, and even the people close to him have receded into the background."</p><p>And again, one after the other, every possible situation was illuminated, some outwardly good and some not very, until we came across a horrifying scene.</p><p>Suddenly, we saw a room, probably in some apartment, a fairly respectable one, but lying on a round table was a naked man. His hands and feet were tied to the table legs, his head dangled, and his mouth was sealed with brown tape. Sitting at the table were two young, solidly built men, one with a buzz cut, the other with slicked-down hair. In an armchair set back under a floor lamp sat a young woman. Her mouth was taped, too, and a fabric cord below her breasts strapped her to the chair. Each leg was tied to a leg of the chair. She was only wearing a torn slip. An emaciated older man was sitting next to her drinking something, probably brandy.</p><p>There was chocolate on the small table in front of him. Those sitting at the round table were not drinking. They poured a liquid—vodka or alcohol—on the lying man's chest and lit it. "They're settling a score," I realized.</p><p>Anastasia moved her ray away from the scene, but I exclaimed, "Bring it back. Do something!"</p><p>She brought the scene back and replied, "I can't. It's all in the past. This can't be stopped. It had to be done before. Now it's too late."</p><p>I watched as if a spell had been cast over me and all of a sudden clearly saw the woman's eyes, which were filled with horror and begging for mercy.</p><p>"Do something! If you have a heart, do at least something!" I shouted at Anastasia.</p><p>"But this isn't in my power. This was preprogrammed, and not by me, and I can't intervene directly. They're stronger now."</p><p>"So where is this goodness of yours, this ability?"</p><p>Anastasia was silent. The terrible scene clouded over slightly. Then the old man drinking brandy suddenly disappeared. Suddenly I felt a weakness through my whole body. I also felt my hand that was touching Anastasia start to go numb. I heard her somewhat weakened voice. She could barely get the words out.</p><p>"Take away your hand, Vladimi ..." She couldn't even say my whole name.</p><p>Rising, I pulled my hand away from Anastasia.</p><p>My hand hung as if numb, the way you get pins and needles sometimes, and it was all white. I wiggled my fingers and the numbness started to pass.</p><p>I took one look at Anastasia and was horrified. Her eyes were closed. The pink had drained from her face. Her hands and face seemed to have no blood at all under the skin. She lay there as if lifeless.</p><p>The grass around her for a radius of about three meters was also white and wilted. I realized something horrible had happened and I shouted, "Anastasia! What's happened to you, Anastasia?"</p><p>She did not react to my cry in any way. Then I grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her no longer resilient but rather limp body. Still her perfectly white, bloodless lips were silent.</p><p>"Can you hear me, Anastasia?"</p><p>Her eyelashes raised a very little and her lackluster eyes looked at me, no longer expressing anything. I grabbed a flask of water, lifted Anastasia's chin, and tried to get her to drink, but she couldn't swallow. I looked at her and thought feverishly about what I should do.</p><p>Finally her lips stirred ever so slightly, and she whispered, "Move me somewhere else . . . to a tree."</p><p>I lifted her limp body, carried her away from the circle of white grass, and lay her next to the nearest cedar. After a while she began to come around a little, and I asked, "What was it that happened to you, Anastasia?"</p><p>"I tried to carry out your request, Vladimir," she answered softly, and a minute later added, "I think it worked."</p><p>"But you look so awful. Did you almost die?"</p><p>"I broke the natural laws. I interfered where I shouldn’t have. This took all my power and energy. I'm amazed it was enough."</p><p>"Why did you take that risk if it was so dangerous?"</p><p>"I had no choice. You wanted it. I was afraid not to carry out your request, afraid you would stop respecting me entirely. You would think I was just talking, always talking, and I couldn't do anything in real life."</p><p>Her eyes looked at me imploringly, and her soft voice shook a little when she said, "But I can't explain to you how it's done, how this natural mechanism works. I feel it, but I can't explain it so you'd understand, and your scientists still couldn't either, probably."</p><p>She lowered her head and fell silent, as if summoning her powers. Once again she looked at me with pleading eyes and said, "Now you'll consider me crazy or a witch even more."</p><p>All of a sudden I had a strong urge to do something nice for her, but what?</p><p>I wanted to say I considered her a normal, ordinary person, a handsome and intelligent woman, but I didn't have the sensation of an ordinary relation toward her, and she with her intuition would not have believed me.</p><p>Suddenly, I remembered her story about how her great-grandfather usually greeted her when she was a child. How her gray-haired great-grandfather had knelt on one knee before little Anastasia and kissed her little hand.</p><p>I went down on one knee in front of Anastasia, took her still pale and slightly cold hand, kissed it, and said, "If you are a crazy woman, then you are the best, noblest, smartest, and most beautiful crazy woman of all."</p><p>A smile finally touched Anastasia's lip again, and her eyes looked at me gratefully. The color began to return to her cheeks.</p><p>"Anastasia, that scene was fairly dreary. Did you choose it especially?"</p><p>"I was looking for at least one example, a good one, but I couldn't find one. They're all in the grip of their worries. They're face-to-face with their problems, and they have almost no spiritual communication."</p><p>"So what can be done? What can you suggest other than pity for them? But I have to tell you, these are strong people, these entrepreneurs."</p><p>"Very strong," she agreed, "and interesting. They seem to be living two lives in the space of one. One life is known only to them, not even to the people close to them; the other is their outward life, for those around them. But I think they have to be helped by strengthening spiritual and sincere communication among themselves. They need to strive openly for purity of intention."</p><p>"Anastasia, I will probably try to do what you've asked. I'll try to write the book and create an association of entrepreneurs with pure intentions, but only as I myself have understood this."</p><p>"It will be hard for you. I won't be able to help you enough, I have so little strength left. It will take me a long time to restore it. For a while now I won't be able to see at a distance with my ray. Even now I don't see you very well with my ordinary vision."</p><p>"You mean you're going blind, Anastasia?"</p><p>"I think it will all be restored. Only it's too bad that for a while I won't be able to help you."</p><p>"You don't need to help me, Anastasia. Try to safeguard yourself for our son and help others."</p><p class=section>* * *</p><p>I had to leave and catch up with the ship. I waited for her to look almost like her former self, at least outwardly, and climbed into my boat. Anastasia grabbed the handle on its bow and gave it a shove. The boat was picked up by the current and carried off.</p><p>Anastasia was standing almost to her knees in the water, and the hem of her long skirt was wet and floating on the waves.</p><p>I pulled the outboard's cord. The engine caught, rending the silence I'd grown accustomed to over the last three days, and the boat jerked forward, gathering more and more speed, moving away from the taiga hermit standing in the water all alone by the shore.</p><p>All of a sudden, Anastasia got out of the water and ran down the shore to catch up with the boat.</p><p>Her hair, streaming in the oncoming wind, looked like a comet's tail. She was trying to run very fast, probably using all her strength in doing so, trying to do the impossible: catch up with a fast-moving boat. But even she couldn't do that.</p><p>The distance between Anastasia running along the shore and the boat slowly increased.</p><p>I felt sorry for her useless efforts, and wishing to put an end to the distressing moment of parting as quickly as possible, I jammed the throttle down with all my might. The thought flashed through my mind that Anastasia might think I had once again been frightened by her and was running away. The engine roaring in anguish made the bow rise above the water as the boat rushed forward, increasing the distance between us even faster.</p><p>While she . . . Lord! What was she doing?</p><p>Anastasia had ripped off her wet skirt, which was getting in the way of her running, as she ran and tossed the torn clothing aside. The speed of her running increased, and something incredible happened. Slowly the distance between her and the boat began to diminish. I could see an almost sheer cliff up ahead in her path.</p><p>Continuing to press the now unyielding throttle, I thought the cliff would stop her and put an end to this tortuous scene. But Anastasia kept up her swift running, and from time to time she stretched her hands out in front of her, as if groping the space with them. Had her vision really deteriorated so much that she didn't see the cliff?</p><p>Without slowing her pace in the least, Anastasia ran up the cliff, fell to her knees, raised her hands to the sky, and began to shout more or less in my direction. I heard her voice through the engine's wild roar and the water's noise, I heard what seemed like a whisper: "Sand-bar a-head, sand-bar, sun-ken logs."</p><p>Quickly turning my head, still not fully realizing what was happen, I turned the wheel so abruptly that the boat heeled sharply and nearly started taking on water.</p><p>A huge submerged log, popularly called a toplyak, one end stuck in the sandbar, the other barely poking out of the water, just grazed the speeding boat. A direct strike would have ripped through its thin aluminum bottom.</p><p>When I had escaped to the river's channel, I looked back at the cliff and whispered in the direction of the lonely kneeling figure, which was becoming an ever littler spot.</p><p>"Thank you, Anastasia."</p>

<h2>30. Who Are You, Anastasia? </h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>
<p>The ship was waiting for me in Surgut. Captain and crew awaited orders. But I just couldn't concentrate enough to decide on our route, so I gave orders to extend our stay in Surgut, have a party for the local population, and hold a consumer goods and services show.</p><p>My thoughts were occupied by the events connected with Anastasia. I bought a lot of popular scientific literature in a store, books about unusual phenomena and people's abilities and the history of the Siberian land. I locked myself in my cabin as I tried to find an explanation in books.</p><p>A few questions arose concerning our life. One of them will not quit me even now: Is our system of education and childrearing sufficient for grasping the essence of being and for each person to set priorities in his life correctly? Does that system help or hinder us in making sense of man's essence and purpose?</p><p>We have created a huge system of education. We teach our children and one another on the basis of this system: in kindergarten, school, higher education, and graduate school. This system has allowed us to invent things and fly into the Cosmos. Following it, we build our own daily life accordingly. With its help we try to construct our own happiness.</p><p>We try to understand the Cosmos, the atom, and various anomalous phenomena, which we love to discuss and describe in sensational articles in the press and scientific publications. Only one phenomenon do we for some reason persist in skirting—and skirting very diligently! We give the impression of being afraid to talk about it, afraid because it so easily demolishes our fundamental system of education and scientific conclusions and laughs at the realities of our daily life! We try to pretend there is no such phenomenon, but there is and will be, no matter how much we turn away from it or evade it.</p><p>Isn't it time we took a closer look at it and perhaps, through the combined efforts of human minds, answer this question: Why have all the great thinkers without exception, the people who have created religious and philosophical teachings, the different teachings that the majority of humanity follow (or at least try to follow) been hermits before creating their teachings? Why have they secluded themselves, and in most instances in the forest? Note, not in some super-academy, but specifically in the forest.</p><p>Why did the Old Testament Moses go alone into the mountain wilderness for so long and then return to reveal to the world the wisdom set forth on the stone tablets?</p><p>Why did Jesus Christ seclude himself even from his disciples in the desert, mountains, and forest?</p><p>Why did a man by the name of Siddhartha Gautama, who lived in India in the mid-sixth century BC, seclude himself in the forest for seven years?</p><p>Then hermit Siddhartha Gautama came out of the forest and gave people his teaching—a teaching that to this day, millennia later, excites so many men's minds. People build large temples and call this teaching Buddhism. Later they called this man the Buddha.</p><p>Why did our not-so-very-distant ancestors, who are now historical figures, like Serafim of Sarov or Sergius of Radonezh, also go into the forest as hermits and after a short period of time attain wisdom of such depth that the kings of the world crossed trackless expanses to go see them?</p><p>Monasteries and magnificent temples were erected on the site of their hermitage. Thus Troitse-Sergiev Lavra, in Sergiev Posad, in the Moscow region, for example, attracts crowds of people even today. And all this began with just one forest hermit.</p><p>Why? What or who helped these people achieve wisdom? What gave them knowledge and brought them closer to understanding the essence of being? How did they live, what did they do, and what did they think about while they were secluded in the forest? Who taught them?</p><p>These questions began suggesting themselves to me a while after my contact with Anastasia. Then I began to read everything I could find about hermits.</p><p>But I have yet to find the answer, because nowhere is it written what happened to them there.</p><p>I think the answers need to be sought through joint efforts. I am trying to describe the events of my three-day sojourn in the Siberian taiga forest and my feelings from my encounter with Anastasia in the hope that someone will be able to grasp the essence of this phenomenon and make sense of our way of life.</p><p>From everything I've seen and heard so far, only one thing is indisputable: people who live as hermits in the forest, including Anastasia, see what is going on in our life from an angle distinct from ours. Some of Anastasia's notions are 180 degrees opposite those commonly accepted. Who is closer to the truth? Who should judge this?</p><p>My task has been merely to set forth what I saw and heard in order to give others the opportunity to respond.</p><p>Meanwhile, I was also interested in whether a feeling of love could truly be born in Anastasia just because, while trying to help a village girl, she had cried out, "I love you, Vladimir!"</p><p>Why did the simple words we utter, often without investing sufficient worthy feeling in them, affect Anastasia, despite the difference in our age, and despite the difference in our views on and way of life?</p><p>The popular scientific literature provided no answers. Then I picked up the Bible and found the answer. At the very beginning of John's gospel, it says, "In the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with God, and the WORD was GOD."</p><p>How many times had that struck me—such a laconic and precise definition of this amazing book!</p><p>A great deal became clear to me all at once. Not knowing cunning or deceit, Anastasia cannot utter words blithely. I remembered what she'd said: "I actually forgot that I can't just say words, that they have to have feelings behind them, a consciousness and authenticity of natural information."</p><p>Oh my God! How unlucky she was! Why say these words to me, a family man, no longer young, subject to the many temptations of our world, ruinous and dark temptations, as she herself said? With her inner purity, she deserved someone completely different, but who could love her, with her unusual way of life, mind set, and intellect? At first glance, she appeared to be an ordinary, only unusually beautiful and attractive young woman, but later, when you started to communicate, she seemed to be transformed into a being living beyond the bounds of the rational.</p><p>These feelings may have arisen in me because I didn't have sufficient knowledge or understanding of the essence of our existence. Others might perceive her differently.</p><p>I recalled that even in parting I had no desire to kiss or hug her. I don't know whether she wanted that. What did she want anyway?</p><p>I recalled her telling me about her dreams. What a strange philosophy of her love: organize a community of entrepreneurs in order to help them. Write a book with her reflections for people. Transport people across the dark forces' span of time.</p><p>And she believed it! She was convinced all this would come to pass. I'm a fine one. I gave her my word I would try to organize a community of entrepreneurs and write a book. Now she was probably dreaming of this even more. She should have come up with something a little simpler and more realistic.</p><p>An incomprehensible compassion for Anastasia arose in me. I imagined her waiting in her forest and dreaming that everything would actually happen. If she was just waiting, just dreaming, that was fine. For all I knew, she might still begin to make certain attempts and direct her ray of goodness, expend her soul's colossal energy, and believe in the impossible. Although she had demonstrated to me the possibilities of her ray and tried to explain its mechanism, my consciousness had not accepted it as a reality. Judge for yourself. According to her, she directed her ray at a person, shone an invisible light on him, and bestowed on him her feelings and desire for what was good and light.</p><p>"No, no, just don't think I’m interfering in the psyche or violating the soul and reason. Man is free to take or reject these feelings, to whatever extent he likes and they're close to his soul, however much of these feelings he can hold inside. Then he will become lighter outwardly, too, and your illnesses will abate, either in part or in full. My grandfather and great-grandfather can do this, and I could always do it. My great-grandfather taught me when he was playing with me in my childhood. But now my ray has become many times more powerful than my grandfather's and great-grandfather's because, they say, this unusual emotion called love has been born in me. It is very bright and even burns a little. I have so much of it and I want to give it."</p><p>"To whom, Anastasia?" I asked.</p><p>"To you and to people, anyone who might accept it. I want everyone to feel good. When you start doing what I've dreamed of, I'll bring many of these people to you, and together you . . ."</p><p>Recalling all this and picturing her, I suddenly realized I couldn't not try at least to do what she wanted. Otherwise, doubts would torment me the rest of my life and I would be left feeling I had betrayed Anastasia's dream. It may not be very realistic, but she wanted it so passionately.</p><p>I made a decision for myself, and the steamer set out straight for Novosibirsk.</p><p>I assigned its unloading and the disassembly of the exhibit equipment to the CEO of my firm. I tried to explain myself to my wife and left for Moscow.</p><p>I left to make—or at least attempt to make, at least in part—Anastasia's dream a reality.</p><p class=tbc>To be continued...</p>

<h2>1. Extraterrestrial or Human?</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>

<p>Before relating further events connected with Anastasia, I want to thank all the religious leaders, scientists, journalists, and ordinary readers for their letters, religious literature, and commentary regarding the events set forth in my first book.</p><p>All kinds of definitions have been applied to Anastasia. The press has called her "Mistress of the Taiga," "Siberian Sorceress," "Soothsayer," "Divine Manifestation," and "Extraterrestrial."</p><p>So to the question of one Moscow journalist, "Do you love Anastasia now?" I replied, "I can't sort out my own feelings." Then and there the rumor went out that I was incapable of understanding her due to my spiritual incompetence.</p><p>But how can you love if you can't figure out whom you're loving? After all, to this day no one definition has been applied to Anastasia. I have attempted, basing myself on her assertion ("I am a human being, a woman"), to convince myself that this is so and to find explanations for her unusual abilities. At first, this all went well.</p><p>Who is Anastasia?</p><p>A young woman born and living as a hermit in the deep Siberian taiga, raised after her parents' death by her grandfather and great-grandfather, who also lead a hermit's life.</p><p>Can the wild beasts' devotion to her be considered unusual? There is nothing unusual about it. All kinds of animals live together peacefully in a peasant's yard and treat their master with respect.</p><p>It was more difficult to define the mechanism that allowed her to see at a distance, know about various events in detail (even those that happened a thousand years ago), and sort through our present-day life freely. How did her Ray work, healing people at a distance, penetrating deep into the past, and gazing into the future?</p><p>In his works devoted to analyzing Anastasia's statements and actions, K. I. Shilin, a philosophy professor and corresponding member of the Moscow Aviation Institute, has written:</p><p>Anastasia's creative potential is universal and not a purely individual gift from God or Nature. Each and every one of us is connected to the Cosmos.</p><p>A solution to the impending disaster can be seen in the harmonious synthesis of cultures and principles. The development of these cultures of a harmoniously pure Childhood yields the "feminine" type of culture. This type of culture has been expressed most fully and vividly in Buddhism, but also in our Anastasia. For this reason, I give the following chain of identities:</p><p>Anastasia = Tara = Buddha = Maitreya</p><p>Anastasia is a perfect human being akin to God.</p><p>Whether or not this is so is not for me to judge. However, I can't understand why then she doesn't write down her teachings, as all enlightened people akin to God have, but instead has spent her twenty conscious years working with her summer people.</p><p>Nevertheless, reading scientists' statements, I was able to conclude that she was not crazy, because scientists have at least hypothesized about what she was saying and are conducting experiments in specific areas.</p><p>For example, when I asked, "Anastasia, how do you discern various situations from a thousand years ago and how are you able to see even the thoughts of the great men of the past?" she replied, "The first thought and first word were the Creator's. His thoughts live on today, surrounding us invisibly and filling the universal dimension, reflected in material living creations, which were created for what is most important, man.</p><p>"Man is the Creator's child, and like any parent, He could not wish less for His child than He himself had. He gave him everything and more: the freedom to choose. Man can create and perfect the world through the power of his thoughts.</p><p>"Any thought produced by man cannot vanish into nothingness. If it is light, it fills the dimension of light and stands on the side of the forces of light; if it is dark, on the opposite side. Today, any person can make use of any thought ever produced by people or the Creator."</p><p>"Why, then, doesn't everyone use them?"</p><p>"Everyone does, but to varying degrees. In order to use them, you need to think, and not everyone can do that because of the daily hustle-and-bustle."</p><p>"You mean, all you have to do is think about it, and everything will work out? You can even know the thoughts of the Creator?"</p><p>"To know the thoughts of the Creator, you have to achieve the purity of intentions inherent in Him and also the speed of His thought. To know the thoughts of the enlightened, you need their purity of intentions and the speed of their thought.</p><p>"If a person's intentions are not pure enough to communicate with the forces of light, the dimension in which shining thoughts live, then that person will draw his thoughts from its dark opposite and will come to torment himself and others as a result."</p><p>I don't know whether the explanation by academician A.E. Akimov, director of the International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics at the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, for these statements of hers is oblique or direct, but in his article "Physics Recognizes the Super Intellect," which appeared in the journal Miracles and Adventures, he writes,</p><p>There have always been two approaches to knowing Nature. One is represented by Western science—that is, knowledge gained by the methodology possessed by the West: proof, experiment, and so forth.</p><p>The other is Eastern—that is, knowledge received from without, by esoteric means through meditation. Man does not obtain esoteric knowledge, it is given him.</p><p>It just so happened that at a certain stage, this esoteric path was lost, and another path arose that was extremely complex and slow. Over the last thousand years we have followed this path and have arrived at knowledge known in the East three thousand years ago.</p><p>I have an intuitive conviction that those were right who said that the matter that fills the entire Universe on the field level is an interconnected structure. In "The Universe as Supercomputer," from his book Summa Technologiae, Stanislaw Lem postulates a gigantic Universal Brain, something like a computer. Imagine a computer that, given a volume of the observable universe (with a radius of about 15 billion kilometers), is filled with elements roughly 10-33 cubic meters in volume.</p><p>Such a brain filling the entire Universe is, of course, equipped with possibilities we can neither picture nor dream of.</p><p>But if you bear in mind that in reality this brain functions according to the principle not of the computer but of torsion fields, then it becomes clear that "manifestations of the Absolute of Schelling or the Sunyata, of ancient Vedic literature, are in fact a computer. Besides that, there is nothing more in the world. Everything else is one form or another of the Absolute."</p><p>Here is what scholars have said about Anastasia's long-distance Ray. In "Living Rays and the Living Field," in the May 3, 1996, issue of Miracles and Adventures, the academician Vlail Kaznacheyev, a fellow of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, wrote:</p><p>Vernadsky was probably correct when he posed the question of how the ideal and the intellectual are moving the planet Earth into its new evolutionary phase. How? This cannot be explained straightforwardly merely through labor, bursts, or technogenic activities.</p><p>The facts indicate that man, the operator, can change many electronic instrument displays remotely. He seems to push down the instrument's scale, moreover from afar.</p><p>We have work under way right now in Novosibirsk on remote communication with Norilsk, Dikson, and Simferopol. Work is also under way with the Tryumen triangle and an American center in Florida, through which remote communication with a man, an instrument, and an operator is being established reliably and precisely.</p><p>We have encountered an unknown phenomenon: the interaction of living substance at tremendous distances.</p><p>Unfortunately, the scientists' articles contain many terms I don't understand and citations of works by other scientists. It's hard to read them all, let alone understand them.</p><p>Nonetheless, I did gather that science knows about man's ability to contact another person or object and to manipulate an instrument at a distance.</p><p>Science also knows about the universal data base. Anastasia probably uses this. She calls it the dimension of the forces of light, or the dimension where all the thoughts humans ever produced reside.</p><p>Modern science talks about this, too, and calls it a supercomputer.</p><p>From there I had to make sense of how I, who had never written in a literary way and who had no education for doing so, had managed to write a book that was exciting people.</p><p>When I was in the taiga, Anastasia had said, "I will make a writer of you. You will write a book, and many people will read it. It will have a beneficial effect on its readers."</p><p>Now, this book has been written, and I must assume this was all her doing. Now we must determine how she influences other people's creative abilities. So far, though, no one has been able to do that.</p><p>One could easily assume, of course, that I myself have a little talent and that once I obtained the interesting information from her, I described it. Then everything seemingly would fall into place. There were explanations for everything.</p><p>No need to spend any more time reading the scientific and religious literature or asking specialists questions. Then Anastasia revealed a new phenomenon which no one who has helped me so far has been able to explain.</p><p>If you remember, in the first book I wrote what she said two years ago: "Artists will paint pictures, poets will write poetry, and a film will be made about me. You will look at all this and think of me."</p><p>When I asked Anastasia's grandfather, "So, can she predict the future?" he replied, "Vladimir, Anastasia does not predict the future. She models it and makes it a reality."</p><p>Words—this is all just words. We say all kinds of things. I did not attach any special significance to them, considering them allegorical, because I couldn't even contemplate just how everything Anastasia said would become a precise reality. But the incredible does happen.</p><p>What Anastasia said is steadily becoming reality.</p><p>First the poems started streaming in. I published some of them in the first Russian edition of the book. Then people also began to open "Anastasia houses" in various cities. In the first of them, in Gelendzhik, paintings devoted to Anastasia and nature by Moscow artist Aleksandra Vasilievna Saenko were exhibited.</p><p>I walked into this house and took a look at a wall hung with large pictures. It was as if the space around me had metamorphosized.</p><p>Anastasia looked at me from many pictures with her good eyes. And the subjects! Some of them came from the as-yet unpublished second book. There was the shining sphere that sometimes appears next to Anastasia.</p><p>Later, I learned that this artist paints with her fingertips rather than a brush. Most of these pictures had already sold but were left at the exhibit because people kept coming to look at them.</p><p>The artist gave me one picture, which depicted Anastasia's parents. I could not tear my eyes away from her mother's face.</p><p>Offers began coming in from various studios to make a movie about Anastasia. I was already beginning to take this for granted.</p><p>Touching the pictures and pages of poetry with my hands, listening to the songs, and viewing the frames of film shot, I attempted to make some sense out of what was happening.</p><p>Here, the Moscow Research Center which studies phenomena connected with Anastasia concludes:</p><p>The greatest spiritual advisors known to humanity through their religious teachings and philosophical and scientific investigations have not affected human potential as rapidly as Anastasia has.</p><p>Their teachings produced a tangible manifestation in real life centuries and millennia after the moment they appeared.</p><p>In mere days and months, in some unknown way, bypassing moral teachings and religious treatises, Anastasia has directly affected emotions and provoked emotional outbursts, a creative surge fulfilled in real creations by all kinds of people who have been in mental contact with her. We can perceive them in the form of the works of art inspired by their impulses toward what is light and good.</p><p>How does this hermit, alone in the deep Siberian taiga, at the same time seem to hover over the real spaces of our life?</p><p>How does she materialize her creations through other people's hands? They are all about the light, the good, Russia, nature, and love.</p><p>"She will strew the world with a great poetry of love. Like a spring rain, poems and songs will wash our entire Earth of its accumulated dirt," Anastasia's grandfather said.</p><p>"How will she do this?" I asked.</p><p>"With the energy of her own aspirations, she will radiate inspiration and illumination through the force of her dream," he replied.</p><p>"What is this force hidden in her dream?"</p><p>"The force of Man the Creator."</p><p>"Man is supposed to receive reward, esteem, money, and status for his creations. Why does she give them away?"</p><p>"She is self-sufficient. Her own satisfaction and the sincere love of just one person are the highest rewards for her," Anastasia's grandfather replied.</p><p>These answers have yet to make complete sense to me. Trying to comprehend who Anastasia is and to determine my own attitude toward her, I continued to listen to various opinions about her and to read about spiritual matters.</p><p>Over the span of a year and a half, I consumed more literature than in all the previous years of my life. But what did that yield? I was able to draw only one indisputable conclusion for myself: "Many intelligent books that lay claim to historical authenticity, spirituality, and sincerity may contain false information."</p><p>I was led to this conclusion by the situation connected with Grigory Rasputin. In my first book about Anastasia, I quoted a historical novel by V. Pikul, At the Final Line.</p><p>The novel talks about the semiliterate muzhik Grigory Rasputin, who came from a remote Siberian village, an area where the Siberian cedar grows, and who traveled to the capital of the Russian Empire in 1907. He amazed the imperial family with his predictions, gained access to the family, and slept with a great many noblewomen.</p><p>When people were trying to kill him, they were amazed that after ingesting potassium cyanide that had been sprinkled into his glass he could still get up from the table and go out to the mansion's courtyard. Then Prince Yusupov fired a pistol at the fallen Rasputin at point-blank range.</p><p>Even riddled with bullets, Rasputin continued to live. They threw his wounded body off a bridge and into the water. Then they fished him out and set him on fire.</p><p>Mysterious and enigmatic Grigory Rasputin, who amazed everyone with his stamina, had grown up in cedar territory.</p><p>This is how journalists of the day evaluated his stamina: "At age fifty he could start an orgy at midday and keep up his carousing until four in the morning. He would go from debauchery and drunkenness straight to church matins, where he would stand in prayer until eight o'clock in the morning. Then, at home, after his tea, Grishka would receive visitors until two in the afternoon, as if nothing had happened. Then he would select ladies and accompany them to the bathhouse, and from the bathhouse he would drive to a restaurant in the country, where he would repeat the previous night. No ordinary person could withstand such a routine."</p><p>I, like many others, formed a dissolute image of Grigory Rasputin that corresponded to these statements. But fate offered other information for me to contemplate.</p><p>Here is what Pope John wrote about Grigory: "Today the Holy Monk's body, which was never found, is emerging from the river unharmed. And his secret sons will enter the Ark with a prayer."</p><p>What does this mean? On the one hand, they write that he is a profligate; on the other, a Holy Monk. Where is the truth? Where is the lie?</p><p>I also happened to come across the text of Grigory Rasputin's notes written during his journey to the Holy Land (they were brought to Paris by a Soviet refugee named Lobachevsky):</p><p>The sea calms you without the slightest effort. When you rise in the morning and the waves "speak," and splash, and gladden you. And the sun shines on the sea as if it were very quietly rising, and at the same time the Soul of man forgets all humanity and looks on the sun's gleam; and man's joy is ignited, and his Soul senses the book of life and the wisdom of life—indescribable beauty!</p><p>The sea arouses us from the dream of vanities and much is thought in and of itself, without the slightest effort.</p><p>The sea is space, but the mind is even more spacious. There is no end to human wisdom; it cannot be contained by all the philosophers. There is also the supreme beauty, when the sun falls past the sea and sets and its rays shine.</p><p>Who can appreciate these glowing rays? They warm and caress the Soul and console by bestowing health. Minute by minute, as the sun goes behind the mountains, man's Soul grieves a little for its marvelous rays. The light fails.</p><p>Oh, what silence! Not even the sound of a bird. Man moves from reflection to pacing the deck, recalling without trying his childhood and all his vanity, and he compares this silence of his with the world of vanities, talks to himself softly, and wishes he had someone with whom to relieve the tedium his enemies have driven upon him.</p><p>So who were you, Siberian? Grigory Rasputin the Russian? Where can I find the truth written about you and where the lie? How can I tell them apart? What should I rely on to make sense of your essence and purpose? With the help of what great works, might I sort out the Truth from the lie?</p><p>Where is the spirituality and sincerity, and where is the claim to omniscience? Perhaps I should try with my own heart. I have never written poetry, but I want to dedicate my first poem to you, Grigory Rasputin.</p><p>People are reading Anastasia, and the poems that have come out of that are sincere. I have tried my hand, too. Here is what I came up with for you. Forgive me if it doesn't always sound like poetry.</p><p> </p><p>Dedicated to</p><p>Grigory Rasputin</p><p> </p><p>Semiliterate? Semiliterate.</p><p>From the cedar forests, and so?</p><p>Well, barefoot. Russia's Siberia</p><p>Will wear out many pairs of boots.</p><p> </p><p>I'm off to see the tsar. To help</p><p>Our Little Father live a little longer.</p><p>I'm off to Russia, Mother Russia.</p><p>To have her sip from the ringing cedar!</p><p> </p><p>What? Hussars? Dissolute, you daring</p><p>Lady killers and men of courage?</p><p>So look, just look, how you should</p><p>Let loose! Oh, you, wise men!</p><p> </p><p>Petersburg in Paris clothes,</p><p>Don't let corsets squeeze your heart!</p><p>The gazes of society ladies trembled</p><p>When the Siberian suddenly appeared.</p><p> </p><p>And when he left for matins</p><p>To pray for others' sins,</p><p>He heard Her whisper low,</p><p>She alone implored him, "Go."</p><p> </p><p>Befuddled, growling like a brute,</p><p>The season of the beast swallows the flesh.</p><p>You held yourself like a Soul aflame,</p><p>And now you can't be doused.

I give you the power!</p><p>Show them the accounts unpaid.</p><p>Perhaps you want to shed a tear?</p><p> </p><p>Grishka spat lead bullets:</p><p>"Oh, he's bad, Satan—first accounts, then a tear."</p><p>So how about it, muzhiks? Time to splash?</p><p>The bathhouse's here.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Grigory Rasputin came out of the cedar forests and entered the life of prerevolutionary Russia. He tried to avert the storm of revolution, and he perished.</p><p>Anastasia lives among the cedars as well and is also trying to do good for people and to avert something. But what destiny has our society prepared for her?</p><p>My frequent thoughts about my time with Anastasia in the taiga were quite unusual. When I recalled individual episodes, my memory reproduced them in fine detail and once again showed me the expression of Anastasia's face, the intonation of her voice, and her gestures.</p>

<h2>2. A Money-making Machine</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>
 <p>In my first days with Anastasia I treated her like a hermit with a unique world-view. Now, after all I'd heard and read about her, after her subsequent inroads into our life, she became an anomaly. My mind got all mixed up.</p><p>Having made an effort to cast aside the flood of information and conclusions, I am trying to return to the simplicity of my first impressions and to answer the question I'm often asked: "Why didn't you bring Anastasia out of the taiga?"</p><p>I very much wanted to bring Anastasia out of the taiga, but I realized I could not do this by force. I had to try to prove to her the logic and utility of a sojourn for her in our society.</p><p>I mulled over which of her abilities could be used to the benefit of her, people, and my firm. Suddenly, I realized that I had before me a beauty, Anastasia, a genuine money-making machine.</p><p>Her abilities could easily heal people with every possible ailment. Moreover, she would not make any kind of diagnosis but simply drive out of the organism at once all the ills that had settled there. By some unknown means, she cleanses man's flesh, removing the dirt that has accumulated in it, including every possible ailment, if there. She doesn't even touch the body. I'd experienced this myself.</p><p>She concentrates completely. She looks with her good gray-blue eyes without blinking. Your body seems to warm from her gaze. Then your feet begin to sweat profusely. All kinds of toxins come out through the sweat.</p><p>People pay a lot of money for medicines and operations. If one doctor doesn't help, they go to another. They go to psychics and bioenergy therapists to be cured of just one illness. They sometimes spend weeks, months, years—and Anastasia's treatment takes just minutes.</p><p>I calculated that if she spent even fifteen minutes per patient and for this charged just 250,000 (although many healers take even more), the fees would come out to a million rubles an hour. But this was far from the limit. There were operations that cost as much as 30 million rubles.</p><p>I thought I had come up with a good business plan in my mind. I decided to clarify a few details and asked Anastasia, "You mean you can drive any ailment out of a person?"</p><p>"Yes," Anastasia replied. "I think so."</p><p>"How much time do you need to spend on each person?"</p><p>"Sometimes a great deal of time."</p><p>"How much is a great deal?"</p><p>"Once I had to spend more than ten minutes."</p><p>"Ten minutes is nothing. People spend years getting cured."</p><p>"Ten minutes is a great deal if you bear in mind that in that time I have to concentrate and stop my mind from reasoning."</p><p>"That's all right, reasoning will wait. You know so much as it is. I've come up with something here, Anastasia."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I'm going to take you with me. I'll lease a fine office in a big city and advertise that you will heal people. You will do people a lot of good, and we will have a good income."</p><p>"But I already do heal people sometimes. When I model different situations with my summer people in order to help them comprehend the world of plants around them, my ray drives out their illnesses, too, only I try to make sure not all of them."</p><p>"So they don't even know it's you doing this. Not only does no one pay you any money, but they don't even say thank you! You get nothing for that work."</p><p>"Yes I do."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Joy."</p><p>"Fine, then. You can feel joyful and nice, and the firm can make money as well."</p><p>"But what if someone doesn't have money to pay for healing?"</p><p>"There you go, getting into all the different little nuances. Thinking about that isn't your business. You'll have secretaries and an administrator.</p><p>"You should be thinking about healing, improving, attending seminars to share your experience. Do you yourself understand how this method of yours, your ray, works or what mechanisms are set in motion?"</p><p>"I do understand. And this method is known in your world, too. Doctors and professional scientists know about it. Or they feel its beneficial effect. In hospitals they try to speak with patients encouragingly, to improve their mood.</p><p>"Doctors noticed a long time ago that if a person is depressed, illness is hard to cure and medicines don't help, but if you treat a person with love, the illness will go away faster."</p><p>"Then why isn't anyone trying to figure this out and develop this method of healing to the degree you have?"</p><p>"Many scientists are. Also, many people you call folk healers use this method, and it works a little for them.</p><p>"Jesus Christ and the holy saints used this method to heal people. The Bible talks a lot about love, because this is an emotion that has a beneficial effect on man. It is the most powerful of all."</p><p>"Why do healers and doctors only do a little, while you do so much and so easily?"</p><p>"Because they're living in your world and, like everyone from your world, they have to let in pernicious emotions."</p><p>"What are these pernicious emotions, and what do they have to do with this?"</p><p>"Pernicious emotions, Vladimir, are spite, hatred, irritation, jealousy, envy . . . and others. They and others like them make man weaker."</p><p>"You mean you're rarely angry, Anastasia?"</p><p>"I'm never angry."</p><p>"Fine, Anastasia. It doesn't matter what leads to this effect. What matters is the final result and the benefit that can be derived from it. Tell me, do you agree to come with me and work healing people?"</p><p>"Vladimir, my home and my land are here. Only by being here will I be able to fulfill my destiny. Nothing gives man more strength than his homeland, the Dimension of Love created by his parents.</p><p>"I can heal people and rid them of physical discomfort at a distance as well, with the help of my ray."</p><p>"Fine, then. If you don't want to go, heal at a distance. You and I can come to an agreement on the place where those wishing to be healed will come. They'll pay their money, and at a specific time you'll heal them. We'll draw up a schedule. How about it?"</p><p>"Vladimir, I understand that you want to have a lot of money, and you will. I'm going to help you. Only there's no need to make it this way.</p><p>"In your world people take money for healing. There's no other way in your world. But I would rather do this for no money. Also, I cannot heal everyone one after the other because I haven't understood in which cases healing brings benefit and in which harm. But I will try to understand this. And as soon as I figure it out . . ."</p><p>"What nonsense is this? How can healing a man bring harm? Or do you mean harm to you?"</p><p>"Healing physical ailments often brings harm to the very person healed."</p><p>"Anastasia, your notions of good and evil have been turned on their head by all your philosophizing. Society has always honored doctors, even though they haven't worked for free. Even the Bible doesn't condemn this. So put your doubts aside. Curing a person is always a good thing."</p><p>"Understand, Vladimir, I have seen. . . . My grandfather showed me by example the harm healing can inflict when it is not well thought out and the patient himself does not take part in the healing."</p><p>"What a unique philosophy you have here. I'm offering you a joint, extremely profitable business. What do examples have to do with this?" However, Anastasia told me the following story, which forced me to think about the necessity of treating everyone indiscriminately.</p>

<h2>3. Healing for Hell</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>
<p>"One day I saw, with my Ray, a solitary old woman working in her plot. Agile, thin, always joyful. She immediately caught my interest. Her plot was very small. Lots of different things grew in it, and grew well, because she did everything with love.</p><p>"Then I found out that the old woman took everything she grew in a basket to busy places and sold it. She herself tried to sell rather than eat her first fruits, when they are more expensive among you. She needed the money to help her son.</p><p>"She had given birth to him at an advanced age and been left without a husband. Her relatives had had nothing to do with her. As a child, her little boy drew, and she dreamed he would become an artist. He tried to go study somewhere a few times, and eventually he did. A couple of times a year, he returned to visit his old mother.</p><p>"For her, these visits were the greatest joy, and each time she saved up money and made provisions. She canned the vegetables she grew on her plot for her son's visit and gave it all to him.</p><p>"She loved him very much, and her dream was that her son would become a fine artist. She lived for this dream. The old woman was good and cheerful. Then I did not look at her for a while. When I saw her again, the old woman was very sick.</p><p>"It was hard for her to bend over to work in her plot with her plants, and stabbing pain shot through her body every time she leaned over. But she turned out to be very inventive. She made her planting beds narrow and long.</p><p>"She had taken the legs off an old stool, placed it between the beds, sat on it, and weeded the beds—moving all over her plot on her seat. She pulled her basket behind her on a rope, and she rejoiced that she was going to have a good harvest.</p><p>"The harvest really did promise to be good. The plants sensed her and reacted accordingly. The old woman realized she was going to die soon, and in order to cause her son the least trouble, she bought herself a coffin and wreath and basically made all the preparations for her own funeral.</p><p>"But she also wanted to bring in her harvest and make provisions for her son for the winter before her death. At the time, I attached no significance to why, with such close contacts with the plants in her garden, she was so ill.</p><p>"I thought it might be because she herself ate almost none of the fruits from her plot. She would sell them and with the money she made try to buy whatever was cheaper.</p><p>"I decided to help her, and one day, when she went to bed, I started warming her with my Ray and driving her ailments out of her body. I could feel something resisting the Ray, but I still tried. I probably did this for more than ten minutes until I got what I wanted, until I healed her flesh.</p><p>"Later, when my grandfather came, I told him about the old woman and asked him why something had resisted my Ray. He pondered this and said I had done something bad. Then I got upset. I asked my grandfather to explain why. He paused and then said, 'You healed her body.'"</p><p>I interrupted. "And what was so bad that you could have done to the old woman's soul?"</p><p>Anastasia sighed and went on.</p><p>"The old woman stopped ailing and did not die. Her son came to see her earlier than usual. He only came for two days and said he had abandoned his studies and didn't want to be an artist and was working at something else that brought him an income.</p><p>"He had married. Now he would have money. And she shouldn't put up all those jars for him because shipping them was more expensive now.</p><p>"'You should eat better yourself, mother,' he told her.</p><p>"He left without taking anything. In the morning the old woman sat down on her porch and looked at her little plot, and her eyes held terrible desolation, sadness, and unwillingness to live. Imagine, a healthy body, but as if there were no life in it. I saw, or rather felt, her terrible desolation in and despair.</p><p>"If I hadn't healed her body, the old woman would have died at the right time, died peacefully, with a beautiful dream and hope. Now she was desolate but alive, and this was many times more terrible than physical death. Two weeks later, she died."</p>

<h2>4. A Private Conversation</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div> <p>"I realized that physical illness is nothing compared with emotional torments, but at the time I still couldn't heal the Soul. I wanted to find out how this could be done, if at all. Now I know that it can.</p><p>"I've also realized that physical illnesses arise in man not only as a result of his removal from Nature or the dark feelings he allows himself. They—illnesses—can also be a mechanism for warning or even saving someone from significantly greater torments.</p><p>"Illnesses are one mechanism, one means of communication between the Great Intellect—God—and man. Man's pain is His pain as well. But there's no other way. How else can you be told, for example, 'Don't throw all kinds of things that aren't good for you into your stomach'?</p><p>"After all, you aren't listening to reason. So reason speaks to you through pain. But you take painkillers and once again go back to doing it your way."</p><p>"So you think, in the end, people shouldn't be treated or helped when they're indisposed?"</p><p>"There should be help, but above all help with a precise understanding of the ailment's primary cause.</p><p>"It is essential to help him understand what the Great Intellect—God—is trying to tell him. But this is very hard. You can make a mistake. After all, pain is a private conversation between two who know each other. The interference of a third party often does more harm than good."</p><p>"Then why did you drive the illnesses out of me? You mean you harmed me?"</p><p>"All your illnesses will return unless you change your way of life and your attitude toward your surroundings and yourself—unless you change some of your habits. They caused your illnesses. I did no harm to your Soul."</p><p>It was clear to me that I could not convince Anastasia to derive income from her powers until she understood something about it perfectly. My business plan collapsed.</p><p>Probably noticing my vexation, Anastasia said, "Don't get upset, Vladimir. I will try to comprehend everything quickly, and right away. If you really want to help people and yourself and not just make money, I will tell you about the ways that man can cure himself of many illnesses, without the undesirable effects that arise when outsiders interfere in his fate. If you want to listen to this. . . ."</p><p>"What else can I do? There's no changing your mind anyway. Tell me."</p><p>"There are several main reasons for illnesses of the human flesh: pernicious feelings and emotions; an artificial routine for eating food; the composition of that food; the absence of short- and long-term goals; and a false notion of one's essence and purpose.</p><p>"One can counter diseases of the flesh by using positive emotions and many plants, and by rethinking one's own essence and purpose one can do a lot to change one's physical and emotional condition as well.</p><p>"I have already told you how to restore the lost link between man and plants in your world, and it's easier to become aware of everything else through personal and direct contact with these plants.</p><p>"The Ray of Love can also heal many illnesses in someone close to you and even extend his life by creating a Dimension of Love around him.</p><p>"But man himself, too, if he has been able to call up positive emotions from within, can with their help dull pain, heal his flesh from illness, and even counter poisons."</p><p>"What do you mean by 'call up,' and how can you think good thoughts if your tooth or stomach hurts?"</p><p>"Pure, vivid moments of life and positive emotions will vanquish pain and disease, like guardian angels."</p><p>"What if someone doesn't have enough pure and vivid moments to call up healing positive emotions, then what should he do?"</p><p>"He needs to come up with something immediately that makes them appear. They will appear when the people around you treat you with sincere Love. Go and create that kind of situation. Create it by performing a deed for those around you. Otherwise, your guardian angel will not be able to help you."</p><p>"I wonder whether I have them and how strong they are? How can I call them up?"</p><p>"You can do this with the help of memories. For example, the memory of something good and pleasant from your own past. Use this memory to feel the grace that was inside you. Do you want to try right now? I'll help. Give it a try."</p><p>"All right, let's try."</p><p>"Lie down on the grass, please, and relax. You can remember starting from the present moment and going backward into the past. You can recall your childhood and proceed up to the present day. You can remember all at once your most pleasant minutes and the feelings linked with them."</p><p>I lay down on the grass. Anastasia lay down beside me and placed her fingers on mine. I thought that her presence would keep me from concentrating on my memories, so I said, "It would be better for me to be alone."</p><p>"I'll be quiet. When you start remembering, you'll forget about me. And you won't feel the touch of my hand. But I'll help you remember everything faster and more vividly."</p>

<h2>5. Guardian Angel, Where Are You?</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>
<p><i>(This chapter has been translated by Susan Downing)</i></p><p>The chronicle of the events of the life I’ve lived began with my childhood. The memories extended up to the moment when I was playing on the sand with the village youngsters, and then broke off. In my soul there was an incomprehensible agitation. Not a single event from the entire life I’ve lived elicited any positive emotions or feelings that resembled those I felt within me the morning after my night spent with Anastasia. Or those that arose in me when she showed me the rhythms of the surrounding natural world by attuning them to the rhythm of my heartbeats. (I have described this situation in the chapter “Touching Paradise.”) But I figured that these splendid sensations had been created in me only by Anastasia, that they were not mine. They were artificial, presented to me by Anastasia. I unconsciously compared them to sensations I’d had in my life, and found nothing analogous. Over and over again, I ran the memories from my life back and forward, like film footage. All the events were connected with aspirations to achieve something, to get something. I would get each thing I wanted, but no satisfaction would ensue. Instead, a new desire would arise… And the most recent years of my life, when those around me figured everything was working out so great for me, agitated me even more. The cars I’d acquired, the women, the banquets, the gifts and the congratulations – they seemed empty and unnecessary.</p><p>I stood up abruptly and said, with irritation – maybe to myself, maybe to Anastasia, “People don’t have these healing sensations in their lives! At least, I don’t have them in mine. And you might not be able to find them in many others’ lives, either.”</p><p>Anastasia stood up, too, and calmly noted:</p><p>“Then you need to create them as quickly as possible.”</p><p>“What do you mean, what do I need to create? What?”</p><p>“First of all, you need to realize where the greatest significance lies, the meaning. Just now you reviewed your life. But even though you had the opportunity to analyze and look at it as if from the outside, you were all the same unable to take note of what is significant. You kept latching onto the ordinary – as you understand them – values. Tell me, in what situation have you managed to even come close to the sensation of happiness?”</p><p>“There were two situations, but something kept me from experiencing them as completely happy.”</p><p>“What situations were those?”</p><p>“Back at the beginning of Perestroika I was able to get a long-term lease of a river liner. It was the best passenger liner in the Western Siberian river fleet. It was called the Mixail Kalinin. The papers for long-term rental of the liner were finalized. I drive up to the pier and there it stands – a beauty! – and I step on the deck of my ship for the very first time.”</p><p>“And did your joyful sensations get much stronger as you stepped onto the deck?”</p><p>“You have to understand, Anastasia – there are many different problems in our life. When I stepped onto the ship, the captain met me. We went to his cabin. We each drank a goblet of champagne. We chatted. The captain said that the water pipes had to be flushed out, or else the Health Department wouldn’t give us permission to set out on our voyage. And the captain also said …”</p><p>“And so, Vladimir, you submerged yourself in all the concerns and problems connected to the liner’s operation.”</p><p>“Yes, I submerged myself. There were a lot of them.”</p><p>“Vladimir, it is characteristic of artificially-created matter and various pieces of machinery to bring more problems than joy. And their aid to man is illusory, as well.”</p><p>“I don’t agree with you. Maybe pieces of machinery do create problems all on their own – they need to be repaired and serviced. But on the other hand, you can achieve a lot with their help.”</p><p>“Such as what, for example?”</p><p>“Even love.”</p><p>“Vladimir, artificially-created objects hold no sway over true love. Even were all of them in the world to belong to you, you would be unable to get your hands on the true love of even one woman with only their help.”</p><p>“Well, you just don’t know women. And yet, you pass judgment. Now me, I actually did get it.”</p><p>“Did get what?”</p><p>“Love. I got it without any trouble whatsoever. I had loved a certain woman very powerfully. For more than a year. But she wasn’t very inclined to go off anywhere alone with me. When the liner came into the picture, I invited her to visit it, and she came. Can you imagine how great that was?! She and I were sitting alone at a table in the ship’s bar. Champagne, fabulous wine, candles burning, music – and not a soul around. Only us in the empty bar of my ship. She alone was before me. I set the ship sailing and didn’t bring anyone else on board, so I could be alone with her. The ship is sailing along the river. Music is playing in the bar. I invited her to dance. She had a fabulous figure and bust. I pressed her to me, and my heart began beating joyfully, and I kissed her on the lips! She didn’t pull away – she embraced me back. Do you understand? She was right next to me, and I could touch her, kiss her. All of this was thanks to the ship, and you say – nothing but problems.”</p><p>“And what happened to you next, Vladimir?”</p><p>“That’s unimportant.”</p><p>“All the same, please recall.”</p><p>“I’m telling you – that’s unimportant. It’s of no consequence.”</p><p>“May I tell you what happened there, on the ship, with you and this young woman?”</p><p>“Give it a shot.”</p><p>“You had a lot of alcohol to drink. You made a point of trying to drink as much as possible. Then you put down in front of her the keys to your cabin, your fabulous quarters, but you yourself – you went down into the hold. You slept for nearly twenty-four hours in a small sailor’s cabin. And do you know why?”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“There came a moment when you saw a strange expression on the face of the young woman you loved, a vacant smile. Intuitively, without yet realizing it, you understood that she, your beloved, was daydreaming: ‘How happy I’d be if it weren’t Megre sitting at the table with me in the bar of this ship, but my beloved.’ The woman you loved was dreaming of another, of someone she liked. She was dreaming that he owned this ship, and not you. You were under the control of dead matter. You had linked your live feelings and aspirations with it and were killing them.”</p><p>“You don’t need to go on, Anastasia. These memories are unpleasant to me. And all the same, the ship played its part. You and I met thanks to the ship.”</p><p>“It is preexisting feelings and flights of the soul which construct the sum events of the present, and only they affect the future. And only their running start and the beat of their wings are reflected in the heavenly mirrors. And only their flights and aspirations will be reflected in the sum events of earthly existence.”</p><p>“How am I to understand that?”</p><p>“Many aspirations of your soul and mine – and perhaps even of our genitors near and distant – might have preceded our meetings. Perhaps one impulse alone of a cherry tree growing in the garden of your country house did this. But not a ship.”</p><p>“What’s a cherry tree in my garden got to do with it?”</p><p>“Upon reviewing your life many times, you assigned no significance whatsoever to this cherry tree and to your own feelings that were connected to it, but precisely these feelings were the major event of the recent years of your life. The Universe did not respond to your ship. Think about it: what in the world could a primitive, creaking mechanism that doesn’t know how to think and self-actualize mean for the Universe? But a cherry tree… A small Siberian cherry tree, for which you didn’t even leave any space in your memories, roused the universal expanses and altered the course of events connected not only to you and to me. Because it is alive and, like all that lives, is inseparably linked with all creation.”</p>

<h2>6. The Cherry Tree</h2>

<p>"Vladimir, remember everything you connect to this little tree. Remember starting from the moment you first touched it."</p><p>"I'll try, if you think it's important."</p><p>"Yes, it's important."</p><p>"I was riding in a car. I don't remember where I was going. I stopped near the Central Market. I asked the driver to get out and buy some fruit. I myself sat there and saw people leaving the market dragging all kinds of saplings."</p><p>"You saw them and were amazed. At what?"</p><p>"Imagine, their faces were so joyous and content. It was raining and cold outside, and they were lugging these saplings with roots wrapped round with rags. The saplings were heavy but their faces were content, while I was sitting inside a warm car feeling sad.</p><p>"When the driver returned I went to the market. I walked and walked among the sellers and bought three small cherry saplings. When I tossed them in the trunk, my driver said one tree wouldn't survive because its roots were chopped off too short and I should throw it out right away, but I kept it.</p><p>"It was the best-proportioned one. Then I planted them myself in the garden of my country house. For the cherry tree with the chopped-off roots, I threw more black earth into the hole, peat moss, and some fertilizer, too."</p><p>"Through your efforts to help it with fertilizers you burned the cherry tree's two other small roots."</p><p>"But it survived! In the spring, when the trees budded out, its branches came to life. Tiny leaves appeared. Then I went away on my commercial expedition."</p><p>"But before that, every day, for more than two months, you drove to your country house and the first thing you did was walk over to the little cherry tree. Sometimes you stroked its branches. You rejoiced in its leaves and watered it. You drove a stake into the ground and tied the trunk to it so the wind wouldn't break it.</p><p>"Tell me, Vladimir, how do you think plants react to people's attitude toward them? Do they sense a good or bad attitude?"</p><p>"I heard or read somewhere that house plants and flowers do. They can even wilt when the person taking care of them goes away. I've heard about scientists' experiments: data sensors were attached to different plants, and the arrows on the instruments went one way when someone approached them with aggression and the other when someone approached with good."</p><p>"Vladimir, that means you know that plants react to manifestations of human feelings. And just as the Great Creator planned, they try to do everything they can to provide for man. Some bear fruits, others try to call up positive emotions in man with their beautiful flowers, and still others balance the air we breathe.</p><p>"But there is one other thing no less important for their purpose. Those plants with which a specific person comes into direct contact form a Dimension of True Love for him—that love without which life on Earth is impossible.</p><p>"Many summer people long for their plots because that's where this Dimension has been formed for them. The little Siberian cherry tree you planted and cared for also tried to do what all plants do to fulfill their destiny.</p><p>"Plants can form a powerful Dimension of Love for man if there are a lot of them, if they are diverse and man is in contact with them and touches them with love. Together they can create for man a significant Dimension of Love that has a propitious effect on the soul and heals the flesh.</p><p>"You see, Vladimir, all of them together, when there are a lot of them. But you were only taking care of one plant. Then the little Siberian cherry tree tried to do alone what only several different plants can do together.</p><p>"Its aspirations were called up by your special attitude toward it. You understood intuitively that out of your surroundings only this one little tree was not asking you for anything, not dissembling, trying just to give back, and that is why, weary after a stormy day, you would visit the cherry tree, stand there and look at it, so the tree tried.</p><p>"Before the dawn's first little ray of sunlight its leaves tried to catch its reflection in the brightening sky. When the Sun went down, it tried to use the light of a bright star. And it did manage in a small way.</p><p>"Its roots, skirting the burning fertilizer, were able to take what they needed from the Earth. And the Earth's sap streamed through the tree's veins a little faster than usual. One day you came and saw little flowers on its delicate branches.</p><p>"There were no flowers on the other saplings, but this one was blossoming. You rejoiced. Your mood lifted, and then . . . Remember what you did when you saw its flowers, Vladimir."</p><p>"I really did rejoice. For some reason my mood lifted, and I stroked its branches."</p><p>"You tenderly stroked its branches, and you said, 'Good heavens, my beauty, you've blossomed!'</p><p>"Trees bear fruit, Vladimir. But they also form a Dimension of Love. The cherry tree very much wanted you to have that.</p><p>"But where was the little tree to get the strength to repay man for what it had received from him? It had already given everything within its powers, but it had also received unusual kindness. That was when it wanted to do more! By itself!</p><p>"You left on your extended expedition. When you returned, you were walking through the garden toward the cherry tree. Walking and eating cherries you'd bought in the market. When you came up to it you saw three red berries also hanging on your cherry tree.</p><p>"You stood in front of it, weary, ate the market cherries, and spat out the pits. Then you picked one berry from your tree and tried it. It was a little sourer than the market ones, so you didn't touch the two that were left."</p><p>"I'd had my fill of the other cherries, and its berry really was sourer."</p><p>"If only you'd known, Vladimir, how much benefit for you those little berries contained. How much energy and Love. It had collected everything beneficial for you both from the bowels of the Earth and from the universe's expanses and put it into these three berries. It had even let one of its branches wither so those three berries could ripen. You tried one and didn't touch the remaining two."</p><p>"But I didn't know. Still I liked the fact that it could bear fruit."</p><p>"Yes, you did. And then . . . do you remember what you did that time?"</p><p>"Me? I stroked the cherry tree's branches again."</p><p>"You didn't just stroke them. You also leaned over and kissed a little leaf of the branch resting in your palm."</p><p>"Yes, I did. Because my mood was so good."</p><p>"And something incredible happened to the tree. What else could it do for you if you hadn't taken the fruits it had cultivated with such love?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"It trembled from the human kiss and thoughts and feelings inherent in man alone but produced by the little Siberian cherry tree flew up into the light dimension of the Universe to give back what it had received from man.</p><p>"To thank man for his kiss of Love and warm him with the light emotions of Love. Counter to all laws, its thought raced through the Universe and did not find embodiment.</p><p>"The realization that embodiment is impossible is death. The Forces of Light returned to the tree the thought it had produced so that it could destroy it in itself and not perish. But it wouldn't!</p><p>"The little Siberian cherry tree's ardent desire remained unaltered, unusually pure, and reverent. The Forces of Light didn't know what to do. The Great Creator did not alter the established laws of harmony. But the cherry tree did not perish.</p><p>"It did not perish because its thoughts and aspirations, its emotions, were unusually pure, and according to the laws of the universe nothing can destroy pure love. It hovered over you and dashed about, trying to find embodiment. Alone in the Universe it tried to create a Dimension of Love for you.</p><p>"I came to your ship in order to try to help somehow and to embody what the tree desired, still not knowing to whom it was addressed."</p><p>"You mean your attitude toward me is due to your desire to help the tree?"</p><p>"My attitude toward you, Vladimir, is just my attitude. It's hard to say who is helping whom, the cherry tree or me? Everything in the Universe is interconnected.</p><p>"You have to perceive reality yourself. But right now, if you'll let me, I'll make what the cherry tree wished a reality. May I kiss you for it?"</p><p>"Of course you may. If that's what's needed. And when I return, I'll eat all its berries."</p><p>Anastasia closed her eyes. She pressed her hands to her chest and softly whispered, "Cherry tree, feel this. I know you can. Right now I'll do what you wanted to do. This will be your kiss, cherry tree."</p><p>Then Anastasia quickly placed her hands on my shoulders without opening her eyes, drew close, touched her lips to my cheek, and fell still.</p><p>A strange kiss, a simple brush of the lips. But it was different from every kiss I had ever known. It called up an unusually pleasant sensation I had never known before. The technique of moving the lips, tongue, or body is probably not important here. The main thing is probably what is concealed inside the person and revealed by the kiss.</p><p>But what was concealed inside this taiga hermit? Where did she get all her knowledge, special abilities, and feelings? Or could everything she said be merely the fruit of her imagination?</p><p>But then where did the unusually mellow and bewitching feelings that warmed my entire insides come from? Maybe, through our joint efforts, we can uncover the secret with the help of the following situation, which I had occasion to witness.</p>  <div class=chapter id=0207>

<h2>7. Who is to Blame?</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>
<p>One day, Anastasia tried to explain to me something about her way of life and faith, but she couldn't find the appropriate and understandable words she must have wanted so very much to find.</p><p>Then Anastasia quickly turned to face the Ringing Cedar and placed her palms on its trunk. Something incomprehensible began to happen. Looking up, addressing either the Cedar or someone high above, she suddenly began speaking with passion and inspiration—first in words, then in sounds.</p><p>She was trying to explain, prove, plead for something. Insistent, demanding notes were interspersed in her monologue. The crackling—the Cedar's ringing—intensified. Its Ray became brighter and thicker. Then Anastasia spoke imperiously:</p><p>"Answer me. Answer! Explain! Give it to me! Give it!" At this she shook her head and even stamped her bare foot.</p><p>The pale illumination from the Ringing Cedar's crown rushed toward the ray, and the ray suddenly broke off from the Cedar and flew up, or dissolved. Right then, though, another Ray appeared that went up toward the Cedar. It appeared as a bluish fog or cloud.</p><p>The Cedar needles pointing down were illuminated by the same kind of cloudlike, barely noticeable little rays, and these rays streamed toward Anastasia but did not touch her. They seemed to disappear, dissolving in the air.</p><p>When she imperiously stamped her foot again and even slapped the Ringing Cedar's huge trunk, the shining needles began to stir and merged their little rays into a single cloudlike ray. But that ray, going down toward Anastasia, did not touch her either. It dissolved in the air as if evaporating, first about a meter away from Anastasia, then half a meter.</p><p>I recalled with horror that her parents had probably died from just this kind of Ray.</p><p>Anastasia stubbornly continued to plead for and demand something, the relentless way a spoiled child asks his parents for what he wants. Suddenly the Ray burst toward her and lit her up like a flashbulb.</p><p>A small cloud formed around Anastasia and melted away. The ray coming from the Cedar dissolved, and the little rays coming from the needles went out. The small cloud around Anastasia melted away. It had either entered her or dissolved in space.</p><p>Beaming and with a happy smile, she turned around, took a step in my direction, and stopped, fixing her gaze past me. I turned around. Anastasia's grandfather and great-grandfather walked out into the glade.</p><p>Taking slow steps and leaning on a stick that looked like a shepherd's crook, her tall, gray-haired great-grandfather, walking slightly ahead of her grandfather, came up to me and stopped. He seemed to be looking through me. I couldn't even tell whether he could see me or not.</p><p>He stood there silently, then he bowed slightly without greeting me or saying a word and headed toward Anastasia. Her grandfather is fidgety but very simple. His entire appearance says that he is a cheerful and good person.</p><p>Coming up to me, her grandfather immediately stopped and shook my hand very simply. He started to say something, but nothing he said then has stuck in my mind. For some reason, both he and I began nervously watching what was happening next to the Cedar.</p><p>Her great-grandfather stopped about a meter short of Anastasia. They stood there for a while, silent, looking at each other. In front of the gray-haired elder, her hands lowered to her sides, like a schoolgirl standing in front of a strict examiner, Anastasia looked like a guilty child, and her agitation was palpable.</p><p>In the tense silence that fell, the deep, velvety, and precise voice of her gray-haired great-grandfather rang out. Without greeting Anastasia, has asked sternly, pronouncing his words slowly and precisely, "Who may bypass the Light and Rhythm we have been given and address Him directly?"</p><p>"Anyone may address Him! Originally, He Himself spoke to man with great joy, and now He wants this," Anastasia replied quickly.</p><p>"Are all paths to Him foreordained? Can many living on Earth know them? Can you see those paths?"</p><p>"Yes. I have seen what has been foreordained for people. I have seen that the future depends on the consciousness of those living today."</p><p>"His Sons and their enlightened followers who have known His Spirit did enough to make the flesh of the living understand?"</p><p>"They did and are doing everything, not sparing their own flesh. They bore and are bearing the Truth."</p><p>"Can he who sees these things doubt in the reason, goodness, and greatness of His Spirit?"</p><p>"He has no equals! He is one! But He wants contact. He wants to be understood and loved the way He loves."</p><p>"Is it permissible to be impertinent and demanding in your contact with Him?"</p><p>"He gave a tiny particle of His Spirit and reason to each person living on Earth, and if the small particle in man, His particle, does not agree with what is generally accepted, that means He, and He specifically, will not accept everything in what is foreordained. He thinks. Can His thinking be called impertinence?"</p><p>"Who is permitted to accelerate the pace of His thinking?"</p><p>"Only the permitter is permitted."</p><p>"What are you asking?"</p><p>"How are we to make those who don't understand, understand, those who don't feel, feel?"</p><p>"Is the fate of those who do not accept the Truth determined?"</p><p>"The fate of those who do not accept the Truth is determined, but who bears responsibility for the failure to perceive the Truth? He who has not perceived it or he who has not delivered it?"</p><p>"What? You mean, you? . . ." her great-grandfather spoke agitatedly and fell silent.</p><p>He stood looking at Anastasia for a while in silence. Then, leaning on his cane-crook, he slowly dropped to one knee, took Anastasia's hand, bowed his gray head, kissed her hand, and spoke:</p><p>"Hello, Anastasia."</p><p>Anastasia quickly knelt before her great-grandfather and began speaking in amazement and agitation.</p><p>"What are you doing, granddad dear, like when I was little? I'm big now."</p><p>Then she put her arms around his shoulders, rested her head on his chest, which was covered by his gray beard, and fell still. I knew she was listening to his heart beat. She had loved listening to his heart beat since she was a child.</p><p>The gray-haired old man, kneeling on one knee and leaning on his cane-crook with one hand, stroked Anastasia's golden hair with his other.</p><p>Her grandfather became agitated and nervous and ran up to his father and granddaughter kneeling there. He stepped lightly around them, spread his arms, and then suddenly also dropped to his knees and embraced them.</p><p>First to rise was her grandfather. He helped his father get up. Her great-grandfather looked closely at Anastasia one more time, slowly turned, and began moving away. Her grandfather quickly began talking, although to whom wasn't clear.</p><p>"Everyone keeps spoiling her. So does He. Look at what she's gotten into. She pokes her nose in wherever she wants. There's no one to teach her better. Who is going to help the summer people now? Who?"</p><p>Her great-grandfather stopped. Slowly, he turned around, and once again his deep, velvety voice spoke precisely:</p><p>"Granddaughter dear, do what your heart and Soul tell you. I will help you with your summer people myself." Turning around, the magisterial, gray-haired old man walked slowly from the glade.</p><p>"I'm telling you, everyone keeps spoiling her," her grandfather began again.</p><p>He picked up a switch saying, "So I'm going to teach her right now," he minced toward Anastasia, swinging the switch.</p><p>"Oh no!" Anastasia clapped her hands, feigning fright, then she burst into laughter and dodged her grandfather as he approached.</p><p>"Now she thinks she can run away, too. As if I couldn't catch her!"</p><p>And he started running toward Anastasia with unusual speed and ease. She ran away laughing, looping through the glade. Her grandfather didn't lag behind, but he couldn't catch up either.</p><p>All of a sudden her grandfather gasped and plopped down, grabbing his foot. Anastasia quickly turned, her face filled with concern. She ran up to her grandfather and held out her hand. There she fell still. Her cascading, infectious laughter filled the glade. I looked closely at her grandfather's pose and understood the reason for her merriment.</p><p>Her grandfather was squatting on one leg and was holding the other stretched out in front of him not resting on the ground. But he was rubbing the leg he was sitting on, as if it were injured. He had outwitted Anastasia but not deceived her.</p><p>As later became clear, he had meant for her to notice the discrepancy, how comic his pose was, right away. While Anastasia was laughing, her grandfather grabbed her by the arm, picked up his switch, and gave Anastasia a light flick with it, as if she were a naughty child.</p><p>Through her laughter, Anastasia tried to playact that it hurt. Despite his unceasing restrained laughter, her grandfather put his arms around her shoulders and said, "All right. Don't cry. Do you catch it? Serves you right. Now you're going to listen. Here I've started training an old eagle. It may be old, but it still has strength and remembers a lot. But she gets into everything, heedless."</p><p>Anastasia stopped laughing, watching her grandfather attentively, and exclaimed, "Granddad dear! . . . My dear sweet granddad! An eagle! . . . You mean you already know about the baby?"</p><p>"There was a star!"</p><p>Anastasia wouldn't let her grandfather finish. She hugged him around the waist, lifted him off the ground, and started spinning. When she put him down on the ground, her grandfather tottered and said, trying to be stern, "Is this how you treat your elders? I'm telling you. A poor upbringing." And waving the switch, he set off quickly to catch up with his father.</p><p>When her grandfather came up to the trees at the glade's edge, Anastasia shouted after him.</p><p>"Thank you for the eagle, granddad dear, thank you!"</p><p>Her grandfather turned around and looked at her:</p><p>"Only, please, dear granddaughter, be . . ."—his tone of voice was too gentle, and breaking off his sentence he added a little more sternly—"Watch out." And he disappeared behind the trees.</p>  <div class=chapter id=0208>

<h2>8. Answer</h2>
************************ ************************ ************************ </br>
</div>
<p>When we were left alone, I asked Anastasia, "Why were you so happy about that eagle?"</p><p>"A little one very much needs an eagle," she answered. "Our child, Vladimir."</p><p>"To play with?"</p><p>"Yes. Only the play has tremendous meaning for his later knowledge and sensations."</p><p>"I see." Although I didn't quite see what kind of play it could be with a bird, even if it was an eagle.</p><p>"But what were you doing by the Cedar? Praying or talking with someone? What happened with you and the Cedar and why did your great-grandfather speak so sternly to you?"</p><p>"Tell me, Vladimir, do you think there is something reasonable? Does Reason exist in the invisible world, the Cosmos, the Universe? What do you think?"</p><p>"I think it does exist, if even scientists talk about it, and mediums, and the Bible."</p><p>"And this 'something'—call it what is closest to you. We need this so we can have an identical definition. For instance, say, Reason, Intellect, Being, Forces of Light, Vacuum, Absolute, Rhythm, Spirit, God."</p><p>"Let's say 'God.'"</p><p>"Fine. Now tell me, does God try to speak to man? What do you think? Not through a voice from the heavens, but through people and the Bible, to suggest how to be happier, for instance?"</p><p>"But God did not necessarily dictate the Bible."</p><p>"Who do you think did?"</p><p>"It could have been people who wanted to devise a religion. They sat down and wrote it collectively."</p><p>"You think it was that easy? People sat down, wrote a book, and came up with topics and laws? This book has lived on for more than a millennium and is the most widespread and widely read book to this day!</p><p>"In the last few centuries many other books have been written, but very few can compare to this. What do you think this means?"</p><p>"I don't know. Ancient books have existed for many years, of course, but the majority of people still read contemporary literature—novels and all kinds of detective novels. Why is that?"</p><p>"Because you barely need to think when you read them. When you read the Bible, you have to think quickly and answer many questions for yourself. Then it becomes understandable. It opens up.</p><p>"If you wittingly treat it like mere dogma, then all you have to do is read and remember a few commandments. But any dogma imposed upon you from without rather than comprehended from within you precludes the possibility of a Man-Creator."</p><p>"What questions do you have to answer when you read the Bible?</p><p>"For a start, try to figure out why the Pharaoh wouldn't let the people of Israel leave Egypt."</p><p>"What's there to think about? The people of Israel were in slavery in Egypt. Who wants to free his slaves? They worked and brought him revenues."</p><p>"The Bible says that the people of Israel had put a curse on the entire Egyptian land more than once. They had even destroyed first-born children and animals. Subsequently those kinds of sorcerers were burned on bonfires, but the Pharaoh would not just free them.</p><p>"Answer another question. Where did the Hebrew slaves get enough goods and chattel and livestock to wander for forty years? Where did they find weapons to capture and destroy cities in their path?"</p><p>"What do you mean where? God gave them everything."</p><p>"You think only God?"</p><p>"Who else?"</p><p>"Vladimir, man has complete freedom. He has the opportunity to make use of everything of the light that God originally gave, but he can also make use of other things. Man is a union of opposites. See, the nice Sun is shining. This is God's creation. It is for everyone. For you and me, for the snake, grass, and flower.</p><p>"But the bee takes honey from the flower and the spider poison. Each has its own purpose. No bee or spider would do otherwise. Only man! One man can rejoice in the Sun's first rays, another curse them. Man can be both a bee and a spider."</p><p>"You mean God did not do everything for the Hebrews? Then how can you determine what God does and what is ascribed to Him?"</p><p>"When man does something significant, the two opposites are always involved. Man exercises his right to choose. What else he takes depends on his purity and consciousness."</p><p>"All right, let's say that's true. Do you mean when you were standing by the Cedar you tried to talk to Him?"</p><p>"Yes, I wanted Him to answer."</p><p>"And your great-grandfather didn't like that?"</p><p>"My great-grandfather believed that I spoke and demanded rather disrespectfully."</p><p>"You really were demanding. I saw it. You stamped your foot and pleaded. What did you want?"</p><p>"I wanted to hear an answer."</p><p>"What answer?"</p><p>"You see, Vladimir, God's essence is not in the flesh. He can't shout to everyone from the heavens, at the top of his lungs, how to live. But He wants everyone to be all right, which is why he sends His Sons, men who could penetrate to some degree to the reason and the Soul.</p><p>"His Sons go on to speak in different languages to other people—sometimes in words, sometimes with the help of music and paintings or in deeds of some kind. Sometimes people listen. Sometimes they drive them out and kill them—like Jesus Christ, for example. And God sends His Sons again. But always only some of the people listen to them. Others don't grasp it, and they break the laws of happiness."</p><p>"I see. Is this why God is going to punish humanity with planetary disaster and Judgment Day?"</p><p>"God doesn't punish anyone, and He doesn't need disasters.</p><p>"God is Love. But this is how it was all planned from the beginning. Created. When humanity reaches the point of failure to grasp the essence of the Truth. When the dark principles manifested in man reach a critical point.</p><p>"To prevent total self-annihilation, a planetary disaster carries away many human lives and destroys the pernicious, artificially created system of life. The disaster is a lesson to those left alive.</p><p>"For a certain span of time after the disaster, humanity lives in a terrible hell, but it is a hell of their own making. It is those left alive who land in hell. Then their children live for a time as in the Primary Sources and reach a point that could be called Heaven. Then there are deviations again, and it all starts over. And so it goes for billions of years in earthly calculation."</p><p>"If everything has been repeated so inevitably for billions of years, what did you want?"</p><p>"I wanted to know how, and with the help of something short of a disaster, I could make people see sense. You see, I've calculated that disasters occur not only through the fault of those who do not grasp the Truth but also from an insufficiently effective means for delivering It.</p><p>"So I asked Him to find that method—to reveal it to me or someone else. It doesn't matter who. What matters is that we have it and it works."</p><p>"What did He tell you? What is His voice like?"</p><p>"No one can say what His voice is like. It's as though His answer is born in the form of your sudden discovery of your own thought. After all, He can speak only through His particle, which is in each person, and this particle transmits information to everything else in man through the rhythm of vibrations.</p><p>"That's why one gets the impression that man alone does everything himself, because man himself really can do a lot. Man is like God, after all. Each person has that tiny particle which God breathed into him at birth. He has given half of Himself to humanity.</p><p>"But the forces of darkness do everything they can to block its effect and distract man from contact with it and, through it, with God. It is easier to struggle with a small particle when it is alone, especially when it has no connection to the Basic Force.</p><p>"When these particles unite and aspire to the light, it is much harder for the dark forces to win and block them. But if just one particle living in just one person has full contact with God, then the dark forces cannot conquer that person—his Spirit, his Reason."</p><p>"You mean you called on Him for the answer born in you as to what to tell people and how to avert a planetary disaster?"</p><p>"Yes, more or less."</p><p>"And what answer was born in you? What words must you speak?"</p><p>"Words. . . . Words alone pronounced in the usual way are simply not enough. So many have them have been said already. Nonetheless, humanity as a whole continues to move into the abyss.</p><p>"Haven't you heard words about how smoking is bad and drinking alcohol is bad? All kinds of people say this all the time, including your doctors, in the language most comprehensible to you, but you persist in doing it.</p><p>"You persist, despite your deteriorating well-being. Even pain does not keep you from these and other pernicious habits. God tells you, 'Don't do that.' He tells you through pain.</p><p>"This isn't even your pain; it's His. Yet you keep taking painkillers and doing what you please. You don't want to think about why you hurt.</p><p>"Humanity knows all the other Truths as well, but it doesn't observe them. The Truths are betrayed for fleeting, illusory pleasure. That means some other way must be found that allows us not only to know, but also to feel other pleasures.</p><p>"The person who knows them can compare and will understand everything himself. He'll unblock his own God-given particle. You shouldn't just frighten man with disaster or blame those who don't grasp the truth. Everyone bearing this particle, this truth, must understand the need to search for a more perfect means of interpretation. My great-grandfather agreed with me."</p><p>"But that's not what he said."</p><p>"There was a lot my great-grandfather said that you didn't hear."</p><p>"If you understood each other without words, then why did you speak the words I did hear?"</p><p>"Don't you find it insulting to hear people in your presence speaking a foreign language you don't understand when they also know yours?"</p><p>I thought it over. "Either I believe everything she says, or I don't. She herself believes it, of course. She doesn't simply believe, she acts. Maybe I can try to cool her ardor somehow, or she's going to knock herself out." So I said to her, "You know, Anastasia, I think maybe you shouldn't knock yourself out like this—you know, demand as intensely as you did by the Cedar. A bluish illumination, or fumes, even fell on you from the Cedar. Your grandfathers had good reason to be upset. This has to be dangerous.</p><p>"If God did not give any of His Sons an answer that explains everything to people most effectively, that means the answer doesn't exist. Planetary disaster may very well turn out to be the most effective means of explanation. Or else He will take offense and punish you, to stop you from butting in, as your grandfather says."</p><p>"He is good. He does not punish."</p><p>"But he doesn't tell you anything either. Maybe he doesn't want to listen to you, and you're just wasting your energy."</p><p>"He listens and answers."</p><p>"What does he answer? Do you know something now?"</p><p>"He suggested where I could find the answer, where to search for it."</p><p>"He suggested? To you? Where?"</p><p>"In the union of opposites."</p><p>"How's that?"</p><p>"Here, for example. The merger of two opposites of human thought into a new dynamic unity in the commentary of the Avatamsaka resulted in the philosophy of Huayun and Kegon, embodying the greatest perfection of world-view elements and parallels to models and theories, as in your modern physics."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Oh, excuse me, please. What am I doing? I let myself get lazy."</p><p>"What are you apologizing for?"</p><p>"Forgive me for saying words you don't use in your own speech."</p><p>"That's it exactly. I don't. They're incomprehensible."</p><p>"I'll try not to do that anymore. Please don't be angry with me."</p><p>"I'm not. Just explain in normal words where and how you'll search for this answer."</p><p>"Alone I won't be able to find it at all. It can only be seen through the joint efforts of the particles in different people with opposite thinking.</p><p>"Only through our joint efforts will it appear in the invisible dimension where thoughts reside. This dimension might also be called the Dimension of the Forces of Light. It is located between the material world in which man lives and God.</p><p>"I will see it and so will many others. Afterward, it will be easier to achieve universal consciousness and to carry humanity across the dark forces' span of time so that the disasters will not reoccur."</p><p>"But more concretely, what should people do now to make it appear?"</p><p>"It would be good if lots of people woke up at an agreed time. For instance, if people woke up at six o'clock in the morning. And thought about something good—it doesn't matter what specifically. What matters is that the thoughts be thoughts of light.</p><p>"You could think about your children, about those you love, and also about how to make things good for everyone. Think like that for just fifteen minutes. The more people do this, the faster the answer will appear.</p><p>"Time zones on Earth are different because of its rotation, but the images created by the light thoughts of these people will merge into a single, bright, and saturated image of consciousness. The simultaneity of the thinking about the forces of light intensifies each person's ability many times over."</p><p>"Oh, Anastasia. You're so naïve. Who is going to agree to get up at six o'clock in the morning in order to think for fifteen minutes? People get up at that early hour if they have a job, for example, or they need to catch a plane for a business trip. Each person will say, 'Let others do the thinking and I'll sleep in.' You'll have trouble finding helpers."</p><p>"Couldn't you help me, Vladimir?"</p><p>"Me? I don't get up that early unless I have to. And if I do somehow, what good would I think about?"</p><p>"Well, the little son I'm going to bear, for instance—your son. How good he will feel when the Sun's rays caress him, the pure and beautiful flowers are near him, and the fluffy squirrel plays with him in the glade.</p><p>"Think about how good it would be if all children were caressed by the Sun and no one ever upset them. Then think about who you're going to say something nice to and smile at that day, how good it would be if this beautiful world lasted forever, and what you, you specifically, need to do to make that happen."</p><p>"I will think about my son, and I'll try to think of something else good. But what's the point? You're here in the forest thinking, and I'm in a city apartment. There are only two of us. You say it takes a lot of people. But until there are a lot more, why should we make this pointless effort?"</p><p>"Even one is more than none. Two together is more than two. Later, when you write the book, people will appear. I will sense that and rejoice in each one. We will learn to sense one another, to understand and help one another through the dimension of the forces of light."</p><p>"Everything you say still requires faith. I don't completely believe in this dimension of light where ideas reside. It cannot be proved because it can't be touched."</p><p>"But your scientists have concluded that thought is material."</p><p>"Yes, but this still doesn't make sense to me, since it can't be touched."</p><p>"But when you write the book you will be able to touch it and hold it in your hands. Like materialized thought."</p><p>"Again about the book! I told you I don't believe in it. Especially in the fact that you, with the help of combinations of letters known to you alone, will be able to call up feelings in readers, feelings of light that will help them comprehend something about this."</p><p>"I've told you how I'll do this."</p><p>"Yes, you did, but I still can't believe it. If I do try to write it, I'm not going to tell everything right away. People will laugh. And you know what I'll tell you honestly, Anastasia?"</p><p>"Tell me honestly."</p><p>"Just don't be hurt, all right?"</p><p>"I won't."</p><p>"I have to verify everything you've told me with our scientists and compare it with what different religions and modern teachings have to say about this. Right now we have a lot of different educational courses and theories."</p><p>"Verify it, of course. You should."</p><p>"Also, I can sense that you are a good person. Your philosophy is interesting and unusual. But if I compare your actions with the actions of other people, those who are concerned about the soul and ecology, then you appear the most backward of them all."</p><p>"Why is that?"</p><p>"Judge for yourself. All the enlightened people, as you call them, have gone into seclusion. Buddha went into the forest for seven years, secluded himself, and created an entire teaching. He has many followers in the world. Christ took to the desert alone for forty days, and now his teaching is admired."</p><p>"Jesus Christ secluded himself several times, and he thought deeply when he was walking."</p><p>"All right, say it's more than forty days. Say it's as much as a year. The elders who are now considered saints were ordinary people. Then they went into the forest as hermits for a while. On those sites, monasteries arose, and they came to have followers, right?"</p><p>"Yes, that is right."</p><p>"But you've been living in the forest for twenty-six years, and you don't have a single follower. You haven't come up with any teaching. You ask me to write a book. You're grasping at it like a straw. You dream of putting your signs and combinations in it.</p><p>"Well, if it hasn't worked out for you as it did for others, maybe that means there's no need to try. Maybe others more capable will think of something, and without you. Let's live in a simpler, way, closer to reality. I'll help you adapt to our life. You aren't hurt?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Then I'll tell you the whole truth, all of it. So you can understand yourself."</p><p>"Tell me."</p><p>"You have unusual abilities, that's without a doubt, and you can obtain any information, as easy as two times two. But now tell me when this Ray of yours appeared."</p><p>"As with all people, it was given to me at the very start. Only my great-grandfather taught me to understand I had it and make use of it when I was nearly six."</p><p>"So that means since you were six, you have been capable of seeing what was going on in our life, right? To analyze and help, even heal at a distance?"</p><p>"Yes, I have."</p><p>"Then tell me what you did for the next twenty years."</p><p>"I've been telling and showing you. I worked with my summer people, as you call them. I tried to help them."</p><p>"All these twenty years, day in and day out?"</p><p>"Yes, sometimes even at night, if I wasn't terribly tired."</p><p>"All this time you've been working hard with your summer people, like a crazy fanatic? Who forced you to do that?"</p><p>"No one could force me. I have done it myself—that is, ever since my great-grandfather suggested it to me and I realized that this was good and very important."</p><p>"I think your great-grandfather suggested that you work with the summer people because he felt sorry for you. After all, you grew up without parents. So he gave you the easiest and simplest assignment. Now he sees you've come to understand something more and has let you work on something else and abandon them."</p><p>"But that something else is connected with the summer people, and I'll keep working to help them. I love them very much and would never abandon them."</p><p>"We call that fanaticism. You lack something a normal person has. You must understand. Summer people are far from the main thing in our lives. They have no influence on social processes. Dachas and gardens are just small farms.</p><p>"The people go there to relax after their main work or when they retire. And that's all. Do you understand? That's all! And if you, with such tremendous knowledge and abilities are working with summer people, that means there is something psychologically deviant about you.</p><p>"I think you should see a psychotherapist. If this deviance can be cured, then you may truly prove useful to society."</p><p>"I want very much to be useful to society."</p><p>"Then let's go. I'll take you to a psychotherapist at a good private clinic. You yourself say there could be a planetary disaster. Then you could help ecological societies and science."</p><p>"Being where I am now will make me more useful."</p><p>"Fine, then you'll return and take up a more serious matter."</p><p>"What kind of more serious matter?"</p><p>"You'll decide for yourself. I think something connected with averting ecological disaster, for example, or some other planetary disaster. By the way, when do you think it will happen?"</p><p>"There are already local hot spots at several points on Earth. Humanity has long been readying more than enough of everything for its own destruction."</p><p>"But when will it be global? When will the disaster come to pass?"</p><p>"This might happen in roughly 2002. But it could be averted or postponed, as it was in 1992."</p><p>"You mean it might have happened in 1992?"</p><p>"Yes, but they postponed it."</p><p>"Who are 'they'? Who postponed it?"</p><p>"Disaster on a planetary scale of 1992 was averted, thanks to the summer people."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"All over the world many different people are fending off the Earth's disaster. The disaster of 1992 did not come about, thanks primarily to the summer people of Russia."</p><p>"And you. . . . That means you! . . . At age six you understood their significance? You foresaw it? You acted diligently. You helped them."</p><p>"I knew the significance of the summer people, Vladimir."</p>

<p>"But why thanks to the summer people, and Russia's specifically? What's the connection here?"</p><p>"You see, Vladimir, the Earth may be big, but it is very, very sensitive.</p><p>"Although you're bigger than a mosquito, too, if one lands on you, you feel its touch. The Earth feels everything, too—when It gets sealed in concrete and asphalt, when the forests growing on It are chopped down and burned, when its bowels are gouged out and powdered fertilizer is sprinkled on It.</p><p>"It can hurt. But It still loves people the way a mother loves her children. The Earth tries to bury its malice deep down. Only when It runs out of strength does that malice burst out in volcanoes and earthquakes.</p><p>"We must help the Earth. Kindness and considerate treatment give It strength. The Earth is big but extremely sensitive. It senses when It is touched gently by even one human hand. Oh, how It senses and longs for that touch!</p><p>"For a long time, people in Russia considered the Earth the property of everyone and of no one in particular. People did not perceive of It as their own. Then in Russia, things changed. The government began giving people small plots of the Earth for dachas.</p><p>"It is no accident that these plots were very, very small and that large machinery could not be used on them. But Russians, who had longed for the Earth, received them joyfully, rich and poor alike, because nothing can break the human tie with Earth!</p><p>"After receiving their small plots, people began to sense this intuitively. Millions of pairs of human hands touched the Earth with love. It was with their hands, not machinery, that people gently touched the Earth at their small plots.</p><p>"And It sensed this. It sensed the touch of each individual hand and found the strength to hold on."</p><p>"So what does this mean? Should we put up a statue to each summer person as the planet's savior?"</p><p>"Yes, Vladimir, they are saviors."</p><p>"But you don't need to build so many monuments. Better you should declare a universal holiday—or at least a day off or two—and name it 'Summer People Day' or 'Whole Earth Day' on the calendar."</p><p>"Oh! A holiday!" Anastasia clapped her hands. "What a wonderful idea. A holiday! We absolutely must have a cheerful and joyous holiday."</p><p>"Just shine your Ray on our government and on the deputies in the State Duma. Let them pass a law."</p><p>"I won't be able to get through to them. They're in their daily grind. They have many decisions to make and no time at all to think. Also, it doesn't make much sense to raise their consciousness.</p><p>"It would be hard for them to become aware of the full reality. They wouldn't be allowed to make decisions that are more correct than the ones being made now."</p><p>"Who wouldn't allow the government and president?"</p><p>"You. The masses. Most of the electorate. You call correct decisions 'unpopular measures.'"</p><p>"Yes, you're right. We do have a democracy. The most important decisions are made by the majority. The majority is always right."</p><p>"The greatest consciousness has always been reached first by individuals, Vladimir, and the majority only after a while."</p><p>"If that's true, then why have democracy and referendums?"</p><p>"They're needed as shock absorbers, to prevent any sudden jolts. When the shock absorbers fail, there is revolution. Revolution is always hard on the majority."</p><p>"But a holiday for summer people isn't a revolution. What's bad about it?"</p><p>"That kind of holiday is a good thing. It's definitely needed. It must be created as quickly as possible. I'll try to think how to make it happen faster."</p><p>"I'll help you. I have a better idea of which levers in our life will be effective. I'll write in the newspaper . Better, I'll write about summer people in your book and ask people to send telegrams to the government and State Duma: 'We request that you declare a Summer People Day and a Whole Earth Day.' Only what date?"</p><p>"July 23rd."</p><p>"Why the 23rd?"</p><p>"It's the appropriate day. Also because it's your birthday. After all, this marvelous idea is yours."</p><p>"Fine. So let people send in their telegrams. 'Make the 23rd of July a legal holiday: Summer People Day and Whole Earth Day.'</p><p>"As soon as government officials and Duma deputies start reading these messages, they'll begin to think about the reasons why people are sending them. Then you zap them with your Ray!"</p><p>"I will! I'll zap them as hard as I can! The holiday will be light and beautiful. Everyone! Everyone will rejoice and the whole Earth will fill with joy!"</p><p>"But why should everyone rejoice? The holiday is just for summer people."</p><p>"We have to make sure that everyone rejoices and feels good. This holiday will begin in Russia, and it will become the most beautiful holiday on Earth—a holiday for the Soul."</p><p>"How will it be celebrated the very first time in Russia? After all, no one will know how."</p><p>"On that day, each person's heart will suggest to him what to do. But I'll create a general model right away."</p><p>Anastasia went on to speak, precisely pronouncing each letter. Inspired, she spoke quickly and with inspiration. Her speech rhythms, her sentence structure, and her pronunciation were unusual:</p><p>"Let Russia rise at dawn that day. Let all people as families, with friends, and singly approach the Earth and stand on It with feet bare. Those who have their own small plots where they cultivate fruits with their own hands, let them greet the Sun's first ray among their plants and touch each kind.</p><p>"When the Sun rises, let them pick and eat one of each kind of berry. They won't need anything more until the midday meal. Let them tend their plots until their meal. Let each think about life and where his joy and purpose lie.</p><p>"Let each think lovingly of those dear to him and of friends and of why his plants grow and give each its own purpose. Before the meal, each should have at least one hour of seclusion. It doesn't matter where or how, but it must without fail be in seclusion, where he can be alone and look inward for at least an hour.</p><p>"Let the entire family gather for a meal—those living together and those who have come from far away that day. Let them prepare the midday meal from what the Earth has yielded for that hour. Let each place on the table what his heart and Soul desire.</p><p>"Then let the members of the entire family tenderly look each other in the eye. Let the oldest and youngest say grace, and let calm conversation flow around the table. The conversation must be about the good and about whoever is by their side."</p><p>Anastasia drew the scene extraordinarily vividly. I could feel myself sitting at the table with people beside me. Caught up in the holiday, believing in it—or rather that it had already taken place—I added, "The first toast should be made before the meal. Everyone should raise their glass and drink to the Earth and to Love." I felt as though I were already holding a glass.</p><p>And all of a sudden she said, "Vladimir, let there be no intoxicating poison at the table."</p><p>The glass disappeared from my hands. And the entire holiday scene vanished.</p><p>"Anastasia, stop it! Don't spoil the holiday!"</p><p>"Oh well, if you want it, let there be wine from berries on the table, and it should be sipped."</p><p>"Well, all right, let it be wine, just so we don't change all our habits right away. What will we do after the meal?"</p><p>"Let people return to their cities. They can harvest the fruits of their small plots of the Earth, carry them in baskets, and share with those who have none.</p><p>"Oh, how many positive emotions there will be on that day! They will conquer many diseases, those diseases that mean death and those that have lingered for years will go away. On that day, let he who is incurably or slightly ill greet the stream of people returning from their little plots.</p><p>"Their rays of Love and Good and their fruits will heal and vanquish diseases. Look! Look! A train station! A stream of people with colorful baskets! See how people's eyes are shining with peace and good."</p><p>All of Anastasia seemed to be beaming as she became more and more inspired by the holiday idea. Her eyes no longer simply gleamed joyfully, they seemed to shoot off blue sparks. Varied but always joyful nuances changed her facial expression, as if scenes from the Great Holiday were streaming tumultuously through her mind.</p><p>Suddenly, she fell silent. Bending one knee and raising her right arm up, she pushed off the ground with one foot and shot up like an arrow over the Earth. She jumped nearly to the Cedars' first branches.</p><p>When she descended, she waved her arm and clapped, and a bluish illumination flooded the entire glade. What Anastasia went on to say seemed to be echoed by each tiny bug and blade of grass and each majestic Cedar.</p><p>Anastasia's sentences seemed to be strengthened by a great invisible force. They weren't loud, but I had the impression that each and every vein of the vast Universe heard them. I too interjected my own phrases, because I couldn't stop myself, as she began.</p><p>"On that day, visitors will come to Russia! All who were born by the Telamons of the Earth! The prodigal sons will return! Let people all over Russia wake at dawn on that day.</p><p>"And let the strings of the Universal harp sound a happy melody throughout the day. Let all the bards on the streets and in homes play guitars. And let he who is very old be young again that day, as he was many, many years ago."</p><p>"Will I be young, too, Anastasia?"</p><p>"You and I will be young, too, Vladimir, as people will be young for the first time. Old people will write their children letters, and children will write to their parents. Let babies take their first step in life and enter a joyous, happy world. On that day there will be nothing to upset children. Let the grownups be their equals.</p><p>"And the Gods will drop to the Earth. On that day, let all the Gods be embodied in simple images. And God—the one, Universal God—will be happy. On that day may you be very happy with love and the shining Earth!"</p><p>Anastasia was carried off by her scenes of the holiday. Becoming more and more inspired, she spun through the glade, as if in a dance.</p><p>"Stop! Stop!" I shouted to Anastasia, suddenly realizing she was taking this all seriously. She was not just saying words. I realized that she was modeling scenes of the holiday with each word and oddly constructed sentence.</p><p>With her characteristic persistence, she would go on modeling and dreaming of it until her dreams became a reality. She would dream like a fanatic! She would try for her summer people as she had been for the twenty years before this. I shouted in order to stop her.</p><p>"Haven't you realized? This is a joke, this holiday! I was joking!"</p><p>Anastasia stopped short. The moment I looked at the expression on her face, my Soul felt a pang. Her face was as distraught as a child's. Her eyes looked at me with pain and regret, as if I were some kind of destroyer. And she spoke in almost a whisper.</p><p>"I took you seriously, Vladimir. I've already modeled it all. And a link has been woven into the chain of events of people's upcoming telegrams. Without them, the sequence of events will be destroyed. I accepted what you said, believed in it, and produced it.</p><p>"I felt you were speaking sincerely about the holiday and telegrams. Don't take back what you said. Just help me with the telegrams so that I can help with my Ray, as you said."</p><p>"All right, I'll try. Please calm down. Maybe no one will want to send those telegrams."</p><p>"There will be people who will understand. People in your government and Duma will feel it, too. And there will be a holiday! There will! Look."</p><p>Once again the scenes of the holiday went racing off. Now I have written about this. Go and act as your heart and Soul command.</p>

</div> <p>"Why did you construct your sentences so oddly when you were talking about the holiday, Anastasia? And you pronounced the words so that each letter sounded so distinct."</p><p>"I was trying to reproduce the picture of the holiday in its details and in detailed images."</p><p>"But what do the words have to do with this? What is their significance?"</p><p>"Behind each word I reproduced numerous events and joyous scenes. And now they will all become a reality. After all, thought and word are the Great Creator's main instrument, and of all those made flesh, only man has been given this instrument."</p><p>"Then why doesn't everything people say come to pass?"</p><p>"When they break the thread between Soul and word, when the Soul is empty and the image faded, then the words are empty, like noise, and they foretell nothing."</p><p>"This is some kind of fantasy, and, really, you believe it all like a child."</p><p>"What fantasy, Vladimir, if I could cite masses of examples from your own life of the power the word assumes if an intrinsic image is formed behind it?"</p><p>"Give me example I can understand."</p><p>"An example? As you wish. A man stands on stage in front of an audience and speaks words. For example, an actor says the same words, and people hear them more than once. But people are only going to listen to a certain actor with bated breath. Another they won't. The words are the same, but the difference is enormous. What do you think? Why this happen?</p><p>"The same goes for the actors. They study at the institute for a long time—some with top grades, some just so-so. Later in rehearsal, they memorize texts so they can say them expressively.</p><p>"They're taught at school how to enter into the image behind the word. Later, in rehearsal, they try to reproduce it. If an actor knows how to form the invisible images behind ten percent of the words he utters, the audience will pay close attention.</p><p>"But if he can insert an image into half the words he utters, you call that actor brilliant, for his Soul will speak directly to the Souls of his audience. People will cry or laugh when their Soul feels everything the actor hoped to convey. That is what the Great Creator's instrument is."</p><p>"But you, when you say something, how many words can you invest with images? Ten percent or fifty?"</p><p>"All of them. My great-grandfather taught me that."</p><p>"All of them? Wonderful! All the words?"</p><p>"My great-grandfather said that an image can be inserted into all the letters, so I learned to construct an image behind each letter."</p><p>"Why each letter? A letter has no meaning."</p><p>"A letter does have meaning! In Sanskrit, each letter has sentences and words behind it. There are letters in them too, and behind those many more words, and so infinity is concealed in each letter."</p><p>"Well that's just great. So here we are, just mumbling all our words."</p><p>"Yes, very often the words that have come down through the millennia are spoken just like that. They come down, cutting through time and space, and the forgotten images that stand behind them to this day yearn to touch our Souls. They safeguard our souls and fight for them."</p><p>"What words are these? Do I know even one of them?"</p><p>"You do—as sound, I think. But people have forgotten what stands behind it."</p><p>Anastasia lowered her eyelashes and was silent for a while. Then very quietly, almost in a whisper, she asked, "Vladimir, pronounce the word 'Bard.'"</p><p>"Bard," I said.</p><p>She winced, as if in pain, and said, "Oh, the indifference and banality with which you spoke that great word! You blew your forgetfulness and emptiness on the candle's flickering flame, a flame carried through the ages and perhaps addressed to you or distant relatives living today. Neglect of the Sources is the desolation of the present day."</p><p>"What didn't you like about my pronunciation? And what should I remember that's connected with the word?"</p><p>Anastasia was silent. Then in a softly resonant voice she began pronouncing sentences that seemed to come out of eternity:</p><p>"Long before the birth of Christ, people lived on Earth, our forefathers known as Celts. They called their wise teachers druids. Many peoples who inhabited the Earth then honored the druids' knowledge of the material and spiritual worlds.</p><p>"The Celts' warriors never bared their weapon in a druid's presence. In order to attain the initial druid level, you had to study individually with the Great Spiritual Preceptor—a druid priest—for twenty years.</p><p>"He who had been initiated was called a 'Bard.' He had a moral right to go among the people and sing, to instill Light and Truth in people with his song, using his words in order to shape images that healed the Soul.</p><p>"Roman legions attacked the Celts. The final battle took place by a river. The Romans saw women with their hair loose walking among the Celtic warriors. The Roman military leaders knew that when those women walked among them, they had to outnumber the Celts sixfold in order to defeat them.</p><p>"Neither those Roman military leaders nor present-day historians have been able to figure out why this was so. But they knew it had something to do with those unarmed women with loosened hair.</p><p>"The Romans advanced a host outnumbering the Celts ninefold. Backed up to the river, the last family of Celts were perishing.</p><p>"They stood in a semi-circle, and behind their backs a young woman was nursing a tiny baby girl and singing. The young mother was singing a light and not sad song, so that fear and sorrow would not settle in the little girl's soul and so that she would have images of light.</p><p>"When the little girl broke away from her mother's teat, their gazes would meet, and the woman would break off her song, each time tenderly calling the little girl 'Barda.'</p><p>"There was no more defending semi-circle. A bloodied young Bard holding a sword stood on the path between the Roman legionaries and the nursing woman. He turned to the woman, their eyes met, and they smiled at each other.</p><p>"The wounded Bard was able to hold off the Romans until the woman had descended to the river, placed the tiny girl in a boat, and pushed the boat from shore.</p><p>"With his last effort of will, the bloodied Bard threw his sword at the young woman's feet. She raised the sword, and she fought the legionaries on the narrow path for four hours straight, not letting them through to the river. As the legionaries tired, they spelled each other on the path.</p><p>"The Roman military leaders watched in silent astonishment but could not understand why strong and experienced soldiers were unable to so much as scratch the woman's body.</p><p>"She battled for four hours. Then she burned up. Her lungs dried out from dehydration, for she hadn't had so much as a drop of water, and blood spewed from her beautiful cracked lips.</p><p>"Slowly dropping to her knees and falling, she was able to send one more faint smile after the boat carrying Barda, the little singer of the future, downstream. The word and the word's image she saved have been carried down through the millennia to us today.</p><p>"The human essence is not only in the flesh. Immeasurably greater and more significant are invisible feelings and aspirations, and sensations are only partly reflected in what is material, as in a mirror.</p><p>"Little Barda became a young woman, then a woman and mother. She lived on Earth and sang. Her songs gave people only light emotions, and like an all-healing Ray, they helped disperse the Soul's gloom.</p><p>"Many mundane hardships and deprivations sought to extinguish the source of this Ray. Invisible, dark forces tried to break through to it, but they could not overcome the sole obstacle—those standing on their path.</p><p>"Human essence is not in the flesh, Vladimir. The Bard's bloodied body sent into eternity a smile from the light of his Soul, reflecting the Light of the invisible human essence. The lungs of the young mother holding the sword burned up, and blood spewed from the cracks in her lips that had received the Bard's smile.</p><p>"Vladimir, believe me now. Understand. Hear the ringing of the Bard's invisible sword deflecting the onslaught of that which is malicious and dark on the path to his descendants' Souls. Please, Vladimir, pronounce the word once more: 'Bard.'"</p><p>"I can't. I can't say it with the proper significance yet. Later I definitely will."</p><p>"Thank you for not pronouncing it, Vladimir."</p><p>"Tell me, Anastasia, since you can say. Who today directly descends from that nursing woman and the young woman, the songstress Barda? And the warrior Bard who fought on the path? Who could forget such a thing? Whose stock is it?"</p><p>"Vladimir, think about why this question arose in you."</p><p>"I want to have a look at him or at those who have failed to remember such a thing, to remember or sense their kinship."</p><p>"Maybe you want to make sure it isn't you who has failed to remember?"</p><p>"What do I have to do with . . . I see, Anastasia, don't answer. Each person should think about it."</p><p>"Good," she replied and then fell silent, gazing at me.</p><p>I, too, was silent for a while under the impression of the picture Anastasia had drawn, then I asked her, "Why did you choose this particular word?"</p><p>"To show you how the images that stand behind the words in the real world will soon become a reality. Thousands of guitar strings are going to sound now under the fingers of Russia's present-day bards. Also, when I dreamed all this, in the taiga, they were the first to feel it. Their Souls. . . .</p><p>"At first a flame flickered in just one, and a delicate guitar string trembled, and then the Souls of others picked it up and responded. Soon many people will hear their songs. They—the bards—will help see a new dawn. A dawn of enlightenment for men's Souls. You will hear their songs. New songs, songs of dawn.</p>
 
<div class=chapter id=0211>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>11. A Sharp Turn</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>After my three-day stay with Anastasia I returned to the ship, and for a few days I was in no condition to get into my firm's affairs. I could neither decide on the ship's further route nor reply to the radiograms receive d from Novosibirsk.</p><p>Both the hired workers and some of the crew took note of my neglect and began stealing. My guards and the police of Surgut, where the ship had docked, detained the thieves and drew up the reports, but I had no desire to attend to these situations properly.</p><p>It's still hard to say why my contact with Anastasia had such a powerful effect on me.</p><p>I'd had visits from many representatives of the most varied religious sects before. They told me they wanted to do something good for society, and they always asked for money.</p><p>Sometimes I donated just to get rid of them, without particularly grasping what they were about. Why bother, if the conversation always ended with a request for money?</p><p>Unlike all those "religious," Anastasia did not ask for money. Moreover, I couldn't imagine what, if anything, I might give her. Outwardly she seemed to have nothing, but she gave the impression that she had everything. I ordered the steamer to head straight for Novosibirsk. I locked myself in my cabin and thought long and hard.</p><p>More than ten years in business and directing collectives had taught me a great deal. The ups and downs had developed my ability to find solutions to many different situations. This time, though, the situation was worse than ever before. All my misfortunes came crashing down simultaneously. My firm's collapse seemed inevitable.</p><p>One of my "well-wishers" at the firm had already spread a rumor that kept mounting: "Something happened to him. He's lost his ability to make effective commercial decisions." That is to say, "save yourself if you can." And they did. Upon my return, I saw how they had. Even my relatives had joined in the general pilfering. "It's all going under, anyway!" they reasoned.</p><p>Only a small ineffectual group of old workers tried to counter the collapse, but when my ship returned and they saw the kind of literature I'd started to read, my psychological condition frightened them.</p><p>I evaluated the situation that had come about perfectly soberly. I realized full well that I could not correct the situation with this group of people. Even those who had once hung on my every word would doubt any decision I made.</p><p>I very much wanted to tell someone about Anastasia, but it didn't seem possible that they would understand. Doing that might land me in the loony bin. As it was, my family had started talking about treatment.</p><p>My milieu tacitly demanded commercial projects from me, and they had to be successful. My new enthusiasms were viewed as insanity or a nervous breakdown. I really did begin thinking about different things in our life.</p><p>"What is happening in it?" I thought. "You roll out a commercial operation and make money, but there's no satisfaction. You immediately want more. It's been like this for more than ten years! Where is the guarantee that this rat race won't continue to the end of my days and that satisfaction never will come?</p><p>"One person doesn't have a ruble for a bottle of vodka, and he gets upset. A billion isn't enough for a billionaire to acquire something new—and he gets upset, too. Maybe it's not a matter of how much money you have."</p><p>One morning, two of my old entrepreneur colleagues, directors of large commercial firms, came to see me in my office. We began talking about a society of entrepreneurs with pure intentions and of our own aims. I wanted to share it all with someone.</p><p>They kept the ball rolling and agreed here and there. We talked for a long time, and I already began to wonder whether they had really understood everything right away, since they had spent so much time on the conversation.</p><p>Then my driver told me, "Vladimir Nikolayevich, they came to you at the request of people who are worried about your health. They wanted to find out what you were thinking about all the time, what's bothering you. In short, whether you're crazy or not. Whether they should call in doctors or wait for this to pass."</p><p>"And what do you think of me?"</p><p>For a while he didn't say anything, and then he spoke softly.</p><p>"You worked well for ten years. Lots of people in town thought you a great success. Now everyone in the company is afraid of being left without any salary at all."</p><p>That was when I realized how far the concern about me had gone, and I told the driver, "Turn the car around."</p><p>I returned to the firm. I called an emergency meeting. I appointed directors for different areas. I gave them full freedom to act in my absence. I told the driver to pick me up early in the morning for a trip to the airport. At the airport, he handed me a warm bundle. I asked, "What is this?"</p><p>"Pirozhki."</p><p>"You mean, you feel sorry for me because I'm crazy, so you're giving me pirozhki?"</p><p>"It's my wife, Vladimir Nikolayevich, she couldn't sleep. She spent all night cooking. She's never baked before, she's still young, but she got it into her head. She insisted I give them to you. She wrapped them in a towel, they're still warm. She says you're not coming back soon. If you come back at all. . . . Farewell."</p><p>"All right, thank you."</p><p>A few days later, he left the firm.</p><p class=section>* * *</p><p>I shut my eyes in my plane seat. The plane was heading straight to Moscow, while I had yet to determine the route of my life from now on.</p><p> </p><p>Only when I arrived at Moscow's Vnukovo airport did I realize that I had enough money in my wallet to spend ten modest days in the capital.</p><p>The workers at my firm and my family were hardly going to be able to deal with the debts that had mounted, and they would have to sell my property, which meant I could expect no help from home.</p><p>Of course, I could have righted things myself had I stayed in Novosibirsk. But that would have meant concentrating on the firm's daily affairs, and I didn't see how I could do that after the events in the taiga and the promise I'd made to either Anastasia or myself.</p><p>Even now it's hard to tell whether Anastasia's influence or my own consciousness and desire guided my actions.</p><p>I was aware that I was ruined. I knew from the many examples of my colleagues that in this kind of situation there was no point relying on relatives, friends, or former workers. Everyone was going to treat you like a leper.</p><p>You could win for ten years and then make a mistake—just one—and receive the contempt and neglect of your milieu. This had happened to many well-known entrepreneurs.</p><p>In this situation, you must count only on yourself and find a solution to your seemingly hopeless situation.</p><p>Dropping off my suitcase—which held a sweater, a few shirts, and a few other small items—at a hotel, I headed out to wander through Moscow. I tried to comprehend the significance of what Anastasia had said about Russia's entrepreneurs.</p><p>I arrived at the Russian League of Cooperators and Entrepreneurs, which had been headed up by Vladimir Alexandrovich Tikhonov, an academician at the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Science whom we had elected back at the beginning of perestroika. The building where the league's presidium was based still stood, but many offices were vacant.</p><p>Vladimir Alexandrovich had died a year and a half before. I was told that six months before, the chairman of Russia's business roundtable, Ivan Kivilidi, and his secretary had been poisoned. Membership in the League had dropped off sharply.</p><p>One of the three remaining workers from the League office knew me and, at my request, gave me one of the unused offices, two telephones, a computer, and a fax machine. The league had no money for organizational work, so I had to act independently.</p><p>I spent the night in this office in order to save time and money on a hotel. The cleaner's arrival woke me at six in the morning. The lack of a TV set allowed me to work until midnight.</p><p>The drastic shift in my circumstances—from my comfortable cabin (where at my ring, they'd bring me anything I wanted to eat or drink) to an office unequipped for living—did not bother me in the slightest and even created greater opportunities for work.</p><p>I thought through and wrote out provisions for the society of entrepreneurs, composed letters of appeal, and sent faxes in the mornings, when the communications systems at other companies weren't overloaded.</p><p>By various means—newspaper announcements and chance meetings, for example—I assembled a secretariat made up of Muscovites from various professions who had grasped the significance of the imminent new Russian society of entrepreneurs.</p><p>The secretariat included three Moscow students as well. The first was Anton Nikolaikin, who had come to repair a broken computer. Later, when he learned about the work organizing the society, he brought his friends, Artyom Semyonov and Alexei Novichkov.</p><p>They began work on an electronic version of "Russia's Gold Catalog" and were able to write a highly professional program.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0212>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>12. The Russian Society of Entrepreneurs</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>The idea of the society was to include entrepreneurs from firms that had worked in the Russian market for at least a year and were sincerely interested in honest partnership, both with each other and with those for whom they were working, as well as with their own collective.</p><p>Representatives from several public entities tried to convince me that entrepreneurs today had become passive toward any kind of association, that the euphoria of faith had passed, and that membership in various associations that anyone could join simply by paying a small dues had declined catastrophically.</p><p>They thus tried to prove to me that organizing a society in which membership required heightened demands on both the individual entrepreneur and the enterprise itself was an absurd idea altogether.</p><p>The problem was that getting information about the society's organization, principles, and structure to regional entrepreneurs in Russia would take about half a billion rubles for printing and postage, since only ten percent of the materials received would yield a positive response.</p><p>There was no such sum. The league leadership took some of the dues they received and used it for leasing their offices, but they had no other source of income.</p><p>Seeing the discrepancy, the league had stopped paying anything at all for organizational expenses, even though the sums contributed by entrepreneurs were intended specifically to finance organizational expenses.</p><p>The league leadership was forced to use the money that came in from entrepreneurs for overhead. The society's office workers had started being paid late. I had to leave the league, abandoning the second computer, bought with the funds of entrepreneurs who had joined the society.</p><p>"How can that be?" The students were perplexed, having written several computer programs basically at their own expense. "We're doing work that this public organization's own charter says it's supposed to perform, but they're treating us like tenants and couldn't care less about entrepreneurs."</p><p>The league had its own arguments: "We have to pay the lease on the offices." I tried to continue the work from the entrepreneurs' trade unions using what was left from paying the office workers, but ran into the same problem.</p><p>Then, after learning about several other public associations, I suddenly saw that they all had a name but no membership. They were like private clubs and cared only about their own internal needs.</p><p>At this point, Russia had no public organization that served a significant number of entrepreneurs, and those organizations it did have were like private clubs. The reasons? Among other things, I thought about the depersonalization of dues.</p><p>For some reason, each organization, after its creation, subsequently began to act in the name of entrepreneurs without consulting the majority.</p><p>I left the trade unions and ended up without any means of communication or money to survive.</p><p>The Muscovites who had worked in the office on the promise of pay were forced to quit.</p><p>I was on my own now. Or so I thought. But the three Moscow students—Anton, Artyom, and Lyosha—had no intention of abandoning what they had started. Anton took his own money, which he had saved up for his vacation, and paid the month's rent for the apartment I'd rented.</p><p>They waited for me to find a solution to the fix we were in and continued their work creating the society. They were caught up by the idea itself. They believed in it. But all I could see was an impasse. Then news arrived from Novosibirsk.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0213>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>13. Toward Suicide</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>Someone from Novosibirsk who had come to Moscow on business of his own came to see me one evening. He brought a bottle of vodka and some snacks. As we sat in the kitchen of the one-room apartment I'd rented, he told me about the state of affairs in my family and firm.</p><p>They were deplorable. My firm had been forced to give up one of its offices downtown because it couldn't pay the rent.</p><p>The auto parts store had gone out of business. The firm's workers had tried to switch to selling shoes, but all they netted was more debt. Full responsibility lay with me.</p><p>"And you're here doing no one knows what. Many people believe you've lost your mind. You should have first put your affairs in order at the firm and then got involved in this incomprehensible business of yours. No one believes in you anymore."</p><p>As we were finishing off the bottle, he asked me, "Do you want me to tell you honestly what I think people expect of you?"</p><p>"Tell me," I replied.</p><p>"They want you to commit suicide or disappear for good. Judge for yourself. Without start-up capital right now, you can't start any business at all, and you not only don't have start-up capital now, you can't even feed yourself. Not only that, your debts are piling up. There is no example in the world of anyone digging himself out of this kind of situation.</p><p>"But if you were gone, it would all be written off with your death, and they would divide up what remains of your property. Your wife says you're a Leo and have always led an extravagant life, but your horoscope says you're supposed to die in poverty. Why did you go on that second expedition? No one can understand it."</p><p>Even though we had done some serious drinking, when I woke up the next morning I remembered every detail of our conversation. His arguments had been weighty and convincing. An impasse in Novosibirsk, an impasse here in Moscow. The people working alongside me everywhere were suffering, and so was my family.</p><p>I couldn't fix everything because there was no solution. My death could end these sufferings. Of course suicide is a bad thing. But the logic of events dictated that my suicide would make the lives of others easier. If that was true, then it was justifiable, and I had no right to live.</p><p>So I decided to kill myself. This actually reassured me. Gone was the need for a tortuous search for a way out of my current situation, since I'd agreed that death was that way out.</p><p>I gave the apartment a quick cleaning and wrote my landlady a note saying I wasn't coming back. I decided to go to the trade union office to put the society's papers in order. Perhaps someone would pick up this work at some later date. But how was I going to commit suicide if I didn't even have the money for poison?</p><p>Then I thought, so it wouldn't look like suicide, I would make it look as though I'd gone for a swim. Like a walrus, I'd dive in and drown. I set out. However, in the connecting passage at the Pushkinskaya subway station, I suddenly heard two young women playing a familiar melody on their violins.</p><p>Before them lay an open case into which people were tossing money. Musicians earn money that way in lots of subway passages. But these two young women, their violins, and the melody floating in the rumble of trains and noise of the passages made lots of people slow their step.</p><p>It made me stop altogether. Their bows were playing the melody that Anastasia had sung in the taiga.</p><p>In the taiga, when I had asked her to sing something of her own, not one of the tunes I knew, I had heard this unusual, strange, and enchanting song without words. At first, Anastasia cried out like a newborn child. Then her voice became very soft and very gentle.</p><p>She stood under a tree, her hands pressed to her chest, and her voice seemed to be lulling and caressing a tiny infant and telling him something. Her very soft voice made everything around us hush and listen.</p><p>Then Anastasia seemed to be rejoicing at a child just awakened, and her voice rose exaltedly. Incredibly high notes hovered smoothly, modulated, and then flew up and filled the space, delighting all around.</p><p>I asked the young women, "What were you playing?"</p><p>They exchanged looks and one of the women replied, "I was improvising."</p><p>The other added, "And I was following her."</p><p>Here, in Moscow, in the grip of the idea of creating a society of entrepreneurs, which seemed to have become my main step in life, I had barely thought about Anastasia. Now, on the last day of my life, as if saying goodbye, she had reminded me of herself.</p><p>"Please, play a little more of what you were playing," I asked the girls.</p><p>"We'll try," the older one replied.</p><p>I stood in the subway passage, listened to the violins' entrancing melody, recalled the taiga glade, and thought, "Anastasia! Anastasia! It's just too hard to do what you contemplated in real life.</p><p>"Dreaming is one thing, but making your dream a reality is quite another. You made a mistake in structuring your plan. Organize a society of entrepreneurs and write a book. . . ."</p><p>I felt as if I'd been hit with an electric shock. As I repeated these words to myself over and over, I sensed something wrong in them, something broken. There, in the taiga . . . in the taiga . . . Anastasia had said them a little differently—but differently how?</p><p>Switching the words around, I came up with this: "Write a book and organize a society of entrepreneurs."</p><p>Of course! I had to write the book first. The book was supposed to solve all my problems and, most of all, spread information about the society. How much time I'd wasted! Furthermore, my personal life had become so complicated. Fine! I would act.</p><p>Now it was at least clear how to act. Of course, someone who doesn't know how is unlikely to write a book that people would read, but Anastasia believed it would work out. She kept trying to convince me of this. All right. I must try, I must. I have to follow this through.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0214>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>14. The Ringing Cedars of Russia</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><img src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ringing-cedars-of-russia-vk.com-kumar82.jpg></div> </p><p> </p><p>I went back to my apartment. Spring was already caressing Moscow. There was half a bottle of sunflower oil and sugar in the kitchen. I had to replenish my pantry so I decided to sell my mink cap. A real fur cap, not a molded one, costs considerable money.</p><p>Of course, the season was over, but I could still get something for it, I thought, as I headed toward one of Moscow's many markets. I approached fruit sellers and goods sellers.</p><p>They looked at the cap but were in no hurry to buy. I had decided to lower the price when two men walked up to me. They twirled the cap in their hands and touched the fur.</p><p>"I should try it on. Why don't you ask someone for a mirror?" one of them said to his comrade, and he suggested we step aside. We moved into a secluded spot at the end of a row of stalls and started waiting for his comrade and the mirror. We didn't have long to wait.</p><p>He came up quietly from behind, and the blow to the back of my head made me see stars. Everything grew hazy. Braced against the fence, I managed not to fall, but when I came to, my buyers were gone, and so was the cap. Two women clucked solicitously.</p><p>"Are you all right? Those pigs. You should sit, here's a box."</p><p>I stood by the fence a little longer and slowly walked away from the market. There was a fine spring rain. Trying to cross the road, I stopped at the curb to look around. My head was roaring with pain.</p><p>I wasn't paying attention, and a car passing close by doused my trousers and jacket hem with muddy water. Dazed, without moving from where I was, I got splashed again—this time even in the face—when the wheels of a truck hit that same puddle.</p><p>I stepped away from the curb and took shelter from the rain under a kiosk awning, trying to decide what to do next.</p><p>They wouldn't let me on the subway looking like this, of course. I could walk the three stops to the apartment were I was staying, but the police might pick me up looking like this, taking me for a drunk, a bum, or simply a suspicious individual. Just talk your way out of that and try to prove your innocence while they're clarifying things. What would I tell them anyway? Who was I now?</p><p>Right then I saw this man. Stepping slowly, he was carrying two boxes with empty bottles and looked like the homeless men and drunks who often hang around commercial stands pouring alcohol. Our eyes met and he stopped, set his boxes on the asphalt, and started talking to me.</p><p>"What are you standing there for, scoping things out? This is my territory. Off you go," he told me calmly but authoritatively.</p><p>Not wishing, not even strong enough, to argue with him or wrangle, I replied, "I don't need your territory. I'll come around soon and leave."</p><p>But he continued the conversation.</p><p>"Where will you go?"</p><p>"Where I go is none of your business. I'll go, and that's that."</p><p>"But will you make it?"</p><p>"Yes, if no one stops me. Stand back."</p><p>"You're not going to stand or walk anywhere for long in the shape you're in."</p><p>"What business is it of yours?"</p><p>"Homeless?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Oh, a newbie. All right, you can rest here for now."</p><p>He picked up his boxes and walked away. He came back with a bundle and began talking to me again.</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"You'll be my guest for a few hours or 'til morning. Dry out. Then you'll be on your way."</p><p>Following him, I asked, "Is your apartment far?"</p><p>He replied without turning around.</p><p>"You'll be dead before you get to my apartment. I don't have an apartment here. I have my deployment."</p><p>We walked up to a door that led to the cellar of an apartment building. He told me to stand to one side, looked around, and when none of the residents was nearby, opened the lock with something resembling a key.</p><p>It was warmer in the cellar than outside. Hot water pipes specially stripped of their insulation, probably by homeless men, heated it. A heap of rags lay in one corner.</p><p>On this pile fell the dim light that penetrated the dusty glass of the cellar window. We proceeded to the far, empty corner.</p><p>He got a water bottle out of his bundle, opened the top, took some water in his mouth and sprayed it all around, like an atomizer. He explained:</p><p>"That's to keep the dust down." Then he moved aside a board standing in the corner. From the gap that formed between the building wall and the partition, he pulled out two sheets of plywood covered with a big piece of cellophane and then a few more pieces of cardboard, also covered in cellophane. He used them to set up two improvised cots on the floor.</p><p>He took a tin can out of the corner and lit the candle set inside it. The can's half-opened lid was clean and slightly bent in a semi-circle and served as a reflector.</p><p>This simple device shone light on the edge of the plywood and the small space between them. He spread a newspaper and began to take from his bundle a piece of cheese, bread, and two boxes of kefir. Neatly slicing the cheese, he said, "You're still standing? Have a seat. Take off your jacket, hang it on the pipe, and when it dries out, you can clean it. I have a brush. Let the pants dry on you. Try not to get them too wrinkled."</p><p>He also took out two sealed hundred-gram cups of vodka, and we sat down to eat. There was cellar dirt all around, but the corner he had fitted out was quite clean and cozy.</p><p>When we clinked glasses, he introduced himself.</p><p>"Call me Ivan. We dispense with patronymics here."</p><div class=img><img src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/in-the-basement-of-anastasias-dream-vk.com-kumar82.jpg></div><p>His maneuvering with the improvised cots and the food neatly laid out on the newspaper, despite the cellar's dirty floor, created an atmosphere of cleanliness and coziness in his cellar corner.</p><p>"Do you have anything softer to sleep on?" I asked after our supper.</p><p>"You can't keep rags here, they get dirty and start to stink. Over in that corner my neighbors . . . Two of them, they come sometimes. They've created a pigsty with their rags."</p><p>In talking with him and answering his questions, without even noticing it I had told him about meeting Anastasia and her way of life and abilities. About her ray, her dreams, and her aspirations.</p><p>He was the first person I'd told about Anastasia! Even I don't understand why I told him about Anastasia's eccentricities, her dream, and how I'd given her my word to help her. I had tried to organize a society of entrepreneurs with pure intentions but had made a mistake. I should have written the book first.</p><p>"Now I'll write it and try to publish it. Anastasia said she needed the book first."</p><p>"Are you really sure you can write it, and then publish it on top of that, without any money?"</p><p>"Whether I’m sure or not, I don't know. But I'm going to act along these lines."</p><p>"So there is a goal and you're going to move toward it?"</p><p>"Yes I am."</p><p>"And you're sure you'll reach it?"</p><p>"I'm going to try."</p><p>"Yes. . . . A book. . . . You need a good artist to design the cover and design it from his Soul, consistent with its intention and goal. Where are you going to find an artist without money?"</p><p>"I'll have to get along without an artist or a design."</p><p>"You need to do this right, with a design and according to your intention, properly. If only I had paper, brushes, and good paint. I could help you. Only all that's expensive nowadays."</p><p>"You mean you're an artist? A professional?"</p><p>"I'm an officer. I've liked to draw since I was a child. I belonged to all kinds of clubs. Later, when I carved out the time, I painted pictures and gave them to friends."</p><p>"Then why did you become an officer if you wanted to draw all the time?"</p><p>"My great-grandfather was an officer, my grandfather, too, and my father. I loved and respected my father. I knew, felt, how he wanted to see me, and that's what I tried to become. I made it to colonel."</p><p>"Which service?"</p><p>"Mainly the KGB. That's what I left."</p><p>"Because of cutbacks or were you fired?"</p><p>"I resigned, I couldn't take it."</p><p>"Take what?"</p><p>"You know, there's this song. The words go, 'Officers, officers, your heart is in their sights."</p><p>"Someone tried to kill you? An attempt on your life? They fired at you, as payback for something?"</p><p>"Officers get shot frequently. But officers have always headed toward the bullets, in defense of those behind, never suspecting that their hearts were in their sights and the fatal shot would be fired from the rear. With accuracy. An exploding bullet. Straight for the heart."</p><p>"How's that?"</p><p>"Remember the pre-perestroika days? The holidays—May 1st, November 7th—and the tremendous columns of people shouting 'Hurrah,' 'Glory,' and 'Long live?'</p><p>"I and other officers, not just from the KGB, we were proud that we were the shield for these people. We protected them. This was the meaning of life for the majority of officers.</p><p>"Then came perestroika and glasnost, and we began to hear other shouts. It turned out we were pigs, we KGB officers. Executioners. We were defending the wrong people and the wrong system. Those who had marched in columns under red flags formed up into other columns and started marching under other flags, and they decided we were to blame.</p><p>"I have a wife, nine years younger, a beauty . . . I loved her . . . I still do. She was proud of me. We had a son, just the one. What's called a late-in-life child. He's seventeen now. He was proud of me too at first—respected me.</p><p>"Later, when all this started, my wife became cold. She wouldn't look me in the eye. My wife became ashamed of me. I turned in my badge and took a job as a guard for a commercial bank. I hid my uniform as far back as I could. But my wife and son's unspoken questions hung in the air all the time.</p><p>"You can't answer unspoken questions. They saw the answers in the newspapers and on the television screen. Apparently, we officers didn't care about anything but our own dachas and repression."</p><p>"But they did show the elegant dachas of military leaders on television, not touched up."</p><p>"Yes, they did—untouched-up dachas. Only those dachas would look like pathetic henhouses compared to what many of their accusers have now.</p><p>"You had a ship over there. And a lot more than a general's dacha. But that general first went to military school and dug trenches. Then he moved from barracks to barracks as a lieutenant.</p><p>"He wanted to have a dacha, a house, for his children—the same as everyone. Who knows how many times during the night he had to jump out of his warm bed in that same dacha to end up in field conditions?</p><p>"Russia used to value its officers. It gave them estates. Now they've decided a dacha with fifteen hundred square meters of land is too much for a general."</p><p>"Everyone used to live differently."</p><p>"Differently. Everyone. But on top of everything else, they always accused officers first of all.</p><p>"Officers went out on Senate Square. They were thinking about the people. Those officers later went to the gallows, the mines, Siberia. No one rose up in their defense.</p><p>"They fought the Germans in the trenches for tsar and Fatherland. Safe behind the lines, the revolutionary patriots were already preparing their welcome home by loading their guns with bullets for their hearts worse than lead ones.</p><p>"'White Guards, brutes'—that's what they called the officers who returned from the war, after trying to bring about order. Chaos all around, everything collapsing. All the old values—material and spiritual—torched and trampled.</p><p>"It was hard for them, those officers, and so they went, putting their officer's uniform on over clean linen. They went on the psychological attack. Do you know what a psychological attack is?"</p><p>"It's when they try to frighten the enemy. I saw it in a movie. In Chapaev, the White Guard officers are marching in formation, and they're being strafed by machineguns. They fall, but they close ranks again and go on the attack."</p><p>"Yes. They fall and go. But the problem is they weren't doing the attacking."</p><p>"So why did they go then?"</p><p>"In military practice, the goal of any attack is the capture or physical annihilation of the enemy, preferably with minimal losses for your own side. You could head into machineguns and take cover in trenches only when you had consciously or unconsciously set a different goal."</p><p>"What goal?"</p><p>"Maybe, counter to the logic of the military art, at the price of your own life, to show, to call on those shooting to think, while they were killing the marchers, to understand them rather than to fire on them."</p><p>"But then their death resembles the death of Jesus on the cross, doesn't it?"</p><p>"It does. We'll have cause to remember Christ again. The beardless cornets and the generals marching in formation were forgotten. Perhaps even now their Souls, wearing clean linen and an officer's uniform, are facing the bullets we've let loose and calling on us to think it over."</p><p>"Why call on us? When they were shot at, we didn't even exist."</p><p>"You didn't then. But the bullets are flying today, too—new bullets. Who is firing them, if not us?"</p><p>"It's true. The bullets are flying today, too, and why for so many years? Why did you leave home?"</p><p>"I couldn't take the looks."</p><p>"What looks?"</p><p>"We were watching TV one night. My wife was in the kitchen. My son and I were watching together. Then one of those political broadcasts began and they started talking about the KGB. Obviously, they laid it on thick. I picked up a newspaper, pretending I had no interest in the broadcast.</p><p>"I wanted my son to switch to another program. He wasn't interested in politics at all. He loves music. But he didn't. I rustled the newspaper and stole a look at him. I saw my son sitting in the chair. He'd dug his nails into the arms so hard that his hands were white. I myself didn't move a muscle.</p><p>"I realized he wasn't about to change channels. I held out as long as I could, hidden behind the paper. Finally I couldn't take it. I crumpled the newspaper, cast it to one side, stood up abruptly, and said, shouted, 'Will you finally turn it off? Will you?'</p><p>"My son stood up, too, but he didn't make a move toward the television. He was facing me, silently looking me in the eye. But the broadcast continued, and my son was looking at me.</p><p>"That night I wrote him a note. 'I'm leaving for a while. I think this is how it has to be.' And I left for good."</p><p>"Why for good?"</p><p>"Because."</p><p>We were silent for a long time. I tried to get more comfortable on the plywood and drift off, but he started talking again.</p><p>"You mean, Anastasia says, 'I'll carry people across the dark forces' span of time? I will and that's that!'"</p><p>"Yes, she does. And she believes she will."</p><p>"She needs an elite regiment. I'd be a soldier in that regiment."</p><p>"What regiment? You misunderstood. She rejects violence. She wants to convince people somehow. She's trying to do something with her ray."</p><p>"I think—I have a feeling—she'll do it. Lots of people will want to be warmed by her ray. Only a few will understand that they need to exercise their own brain a little, too. We need to help Anastasia. She's alone. She doesn't even have a platoon. Look, she summoned you and asked you, and you're lying around a cellar like a bum. Some entrepreneur!"</p><p>"You're lying around here, too, Mr. KGB."</p><p>"All right, sleep, soldier."</p><p>"It's kind of cold in your barracks."</p><p>"So, that can happen, too. Curl up and conserve your warmth."</p><p>Then he stood up, pulled a cellophane packet out of the crack, and covered me with what had been in the package. The three stars on his tunic's epaulette gleamed next to my face in the candle's dim light. I warmed up under the tunic and fell asleep.</p><p>Through my sleep, I heard the homeless men go to their corner with the rags and demand a bottle from the colonel for my lodging, and he promised to pay them back the next day, but they insisted he pay up immediately and threatened him.</p><p>The colonel moved his plywood cot, placing it between me and the homeless men, and said, "Touch him over my dead body." With that, he lay down on his plywood, shielding me from the homeless men. Then everything quieted down. I felt warm and peaceful. I woke up to the colonel shaking me by the shoulder.</p><p>"Up and at 'em! Rise and shine! We've got to get out of here." Dawn had barely broken outside the dingy cellar window. I sat up on the plywood. My head hurt badly, and I was having a hard time breathing.</p><p>"It's early still. It's not even dawn."</p><p>"A little longer and it'll be too late. They set fire to cotton wool with powder. It's an old trick. A little longer, and we'd have passed out from suffocation."</p><p>He walked over to the window with some kind of rod and started prying out the frame. The bums had locked the door from the outside. He pulled out the frame, smashed the window, and climbed onto the windowsill. The cellar window let out onto a concrete recess and was covered by a grate.</p><p>He started working on the grate, trying to wrest it from its mounting, but was having no luck. I stood there leaning against the wall. My head was spinning. The colonel poked his head through the window and ordered, "Squat. There's less smoke down low. Try not to move. Breathe in as little air as you can."</p><p>He pushed out the grate with his shoulders. He moved it aside and helped me out.</p><p>We sat on the concrete pavement next to the cellar window, silently breathing the pre-dawn air of awakening Moscow. Gradually, the dizziness passed. It was cold, and each of us was silently thinking his own thoughts. Then I said, "Your neighbors aren't very friendly. You mean they're the bosses here?"</p><p>"Here everyone's his own boss. They have this racket. They bring in a new guy and take a payment from him for the billet. If he refuses to pay, they slip something in his glass or smoke him out while he's asleep, they way they tried to do us, and then they take what they want for themselves, if there's anything to take."</p><p>"So you, Mr. KGB, you look on all this indifferently. You could have smacked them good over things like this. Or did you just sit in offices shuffling papers the whole time, as an official, and know nothing about intake?"</p><p>"I had to sit in offices and not sit in offices, both. Knowing about intake is one thing. Doing it is very different. An opponent or enemy is one thing. A person is another. And I can choose to ignore it, if it gets to be too much."</p><p>"You call these guys people? While you're ignoring them, they rob people. They're prepared to kill."</p><p>"They are prepared to kill. But you can't stop that by physical means."</p><p>"You philosophize while we nearly died. We barely scrambled out, but others might not."</p><p>"Yes, others might not."</p><p>"There, you see? So why are you philosophizing instead of acting?"</p><p>"I can't beat people. I'm telling you, I can ignore it. Why don't you get going to your deployment. It's dawn already."</p><p>I stood up, shook his hand, and left. After a few steps he called out to me.</p><p>"Wait up! Come back for a second."</p><p>I walked over to the homeless colonel sitting on the concrete paving. He was sitting there, his head hanging, silent.</p><p>"Why did you call me?" I asked.</p><p>After a pause he began, "You think you can get there?"</p><p>"Yes, I can. It's not far. Just three stops. I'll get there."</p><p>"I mean, can you achieve your goal? Are you certain? Write a book and publish it?"</p><p>"I'm going to act. First, I'll try to write it."</p><p>"Anastasia said you were supposed to be able to?"</p><p>"Yes, she said that."</p><p>"Then why didn't you do that right away?"</p><p>"I thought the other was more important."</p><p>"So, you can't carry out her orders exactly?"</p><p>"Anastasia didn't give orders. She asked."</p><p>"She asked. . . . So she worked out the tactics and strategy herself. But you went and decided to do it your own way and just mucked up everything."</p><p>"That's what happened."</p><p>"That's what happened. You need to pay better attention to your orders. Here, take this."</p><p>He held out something wrapped in a small cellophane packet. I unwrapped it and saw through the cellophane a gold wedding ring and a silver cross on a chain.</p><p>"Dealers will pay you half its value. Give it to them for that. It might keep you going. If you need somewhere to stay, come here. I'll deal with them."</p><p>"What are you doing? I'm not going to take this!"</p><p>"Don't think about it. It's time. Go. Come on! Forward!"</p><p>"I'm telling you I won't take it!" I tried to give him back the ring and cross, but I ran into his commanding and at the same time beseeching look.</p><p>"About face. Forward! March!" He spoke in a constricted whisper that brooked no argument, and after a pause, as I was leaving, he whispered, "Just get there."</p><p>When I reached my apartment, I wanted to go to sleep or even just lie down. But I couldn't get the homeless colonel off my mind. I put on clean clothes and started out to see him. On my way I thought, "Maybe he'll agree to stay with me. He's equipped for anything. He's practical and neat. Not only that, he's an artist. Maybe he'll draw a picture for the book's cover. It would be easier to make the rent money together. I don't have anything to pay next month's."</p><p>At the approach to the cellar window we had crawled out of at dawn, I saw a cluster of people—building residents, a police car, and an ambulance.</p><p>The homeless colonel lay on the ground with eyes shut and a smile on his face. He was smeared with wet earth. His dead hand grasped a piece of red brick. A wooden box lay smashed next to the wall.</p><p>A forensics man was writing in his notebook. He stood next to the corpse of another man with a twisted face and crumpled, threadbare clothing.</p><p>In the small crowd, probably of building residents, a woman kept chattering excitedly.</p><p>"I was taking my little dog for a walk, and he, the one smiling, was standing on the box facing the wall, and three of them, bums they looked like, two men and a woman with them, walked up to him from behind. One of the bums jerked the box out, and the man crashed from the box to the ground. They started kicking him and cursing at him. I shouted at them. They stopped beating him.</p><p>"This smiling one stood up. He had a hard time standing up. He told them to leave and that he didn't want to lay eyes on them ever again. They started cursing him again and made for him. When they got close, he just karate-chopped the one who had jerked out the box in the throat, without even taking a swing.</p><p>"I didn't see him take a swing, but he hit him so hard that the other man doubled up and started choking. I started shouting again. The other two fled immediately. First the woman and then the man ran after her. This smiling one was clutching his heart. He should have sat or lain down then and there if he was having a heart attack, but he went back to his box.</p><p>"He walked slowly and moved it to the wall. Holding onto the wall, he climbed onto the box. He stood up on it. He was in such a bad way, you could see it. He started sinking.</p><p>"He was sinking and still drawing on the wall with his red brick, and he kept drawing to the ground and lay face up next to the wall. I ran up to see. He wasn't breathing, but he was smiling."</p><p>"Why did he climb on the box?" I asked the woman.</p><p>"Yes, especially if he was having a heart attack?" someone in the crowd echoed.</p><p>"You see, he still wanted to draw. When those three bums crept up on him, he was drawing. That must be why he didn't notice them. My little dog and I were out walking for a long time, but he stood on his box the whole time drawing. He didn't turn away from his drawing once. There's the drawing, higher up." The woman pointed to the building's brick wall.</p><p>Written in red brick on the building's gray wall was a circle for a sun, a cedar branch in the middle of it, and along the edges of the round sun, around the circle, some uneven letters.</p><p>I got a little closer to the wall and read, "The Ringing Cedars of Russia." There were also little rays coming from the Sun. There were only three of them. The homeless colonel hadn't had the time to draw more. Two short rays and a third ray extended, twisting and fading, to the very base of the wall on the ground where the dead homeless colonel lay smiling.</p><p>I looked at his smiling, dirt-smeared face and thought, "Perhaps at the last moment of his life, Anastasia was able to touch him with her Ray and warm the Soul of this man a little at least and carry it into the infinity of light."</p><p>I watched them load the bodies of the dead into the van. They tossed "my" colonel in like a sack. His head struck the floor of the truck. I couldn't take it. I tore off my jacket, ran up to the van, and demanded that they lay my jacket under his head.</p><p>One paramedic swore at me, but the second silently took the jacket and placed it under the colonel's graying head. The vans left. I felt empty, as if nothing had happened. I stood and looked at the drawing and writing, illuminated by the morning sun. My thoughts were confused.</p><p>I had to do something for my KGB man, this officer of Russia who had died here. But what? Then I decided, "I'll put your drawing on the cover of my book, officer.</p><p>"I will definitely write it. Even though I still don't know how to write, nevertheless I'll write it, and not just one. I'll put your drawing on all of them, as an emblem. I'll appeal to all Russians in the book:</p><p>"'Russians, don't fire your invisible, exploding, bullets, your bullets of cruelty and callousness, into the hearts of our officers.</p><p>"Don't shoot your White, Red, Blue, or Green soldiers, your warrant officers and generals in the back. The bullets you fire from the rear are worse than lead ones. Don't fire at your officers, Russians!"</p><p><div class=section>**************</div></p><p>I wrote quickly. Every once in a while, Anton, Artyom, and Lyosha, the student programmers, would stop by with something to eat.</p><p>They didn't know about Anastasia yet, but I explained to them that the problem of organizing the society could be solved with the help of the book I had to write. So they went ahead and typed the text on computers.</p><p>Lyosha Novichkov did most of this work. He would come every few days, bring back typescript, and pick up a new chapter. This went on for two months.</p><p>One day Lyosha returned with the final typed chapter of the first book, a disc with the complete text, two bottles of beer, a small sausage and something else to eat, and twenty thousand rubles and set it all out on the kitchen table.</p><p>I asked him in amazement, "Where did you get this kind of money, Lyosha?"</p><p>He lived with his mama on extremely limited means and didn't always have enough for the subway and sandwiches.</p><p>"The semester's started, Vladimir Nikolaevich," Aleksei replied. "I've done drawings for a few students and various programs for some who either are too lazy or can't. This is what I've been paid."</p><p>"And are you passing the semester yourself?"</p><p>"Yes. I have one more exam left, and in two days they're taking me to muster for a month, to Kineshma. I'm glad you were able to write Anastasia. Now if you correct anything, Artyom will finish up the typing, but Anton's already mustered."</p><p>"Lyosha, how did you ever take your exams, do drawings for other people, write programs, and also type and print Anastasia every day?"</p><p>Lyosha was silent. I turned to the kitchen table to put the cooked sausages on the table. Lyosha had laid his arms and head on the pages of the typescript about Anastasia that were lying on the table and was sound asleep.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0215>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>15. Guessing the Secret</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>Standing in the kitchen of a small Moscow apartment in front of a table with lukewarm sausages and Lyosha Novichkov sleeping on the pages of my book about Anastasia, I promised myself I would find a way to accumulate capital again and get back my ship so that I could send it on the same route that first led me to Anastasia.</p><p>But it wouldn't be for trade, as before. I'd send the ship during the White Nights, so that Lyosha Novichkov, Anton and Artyom, and everyone who had worked so hard, despite the confusion, often neglecting their own material good, to organize the society of entrepreneurs with the purest intentions could enjoy a nice vacation in the very best cabin.</p><p>What sort of idea is this, and why does it grip people so? Why had it become so dear to me, too? What secret did it hold? I had to sort this out and pin it down, try to solve its mystery and purpose. Why were people so lit up by the dream of this taiga hermit? What was hidden in it? How could I guess its secret?</p><p>Moscow Truth reporter Katya Golovina tried to get to the bottom of it by asking the students, "What moves you? What do you get out of this?" But they couldn't give her a clear answer. They merely said, "This is something worth my while." They too are acting intuitively. But what stands behind this intuition?</p><p><div class=section>**************</div></p><p>Two thousand copies of the first slim volume about Anastasia were printed at Moscow Printing Press No. 11 at the press's expense.</p><p>Why did Gennady Vladimirovich, general director of the Grutsya Press, decide to print the book of an unknown author? Furthermore, why did he, despite the financial difficulties, use higher-grade offset paper instead of newsprint?</p><p>I sold the first volumes myself near the entrance to the Taganskaya subway station. Later, my first readers began to help me. An elderly woman sold it every day near the Dobryninskaya subway station. She explained in detail to everyone who came up to her that it was a good book. Why?</p><p>Later readers began selling it as well at vacation resorts outside Moscow. They wrote announcements themselves and organized meetings with readers vacationing there.</p><p>Yuri Nikitin, the commercial director of the Moscow Publishing Sales Concern, suddenly for some reason decided to prepay the press for another two thousand copies. His actions were odd.</p><p>He drove to see me and said, "My son and I are going abroad for a tennis tournament. The plane's this evening. I needed to bring in my payment before then." He paid for the new print run. When the time came to pick it up, Nikitin announced, "We don't sell books at all in the summer. I'll take a few bundles and you can deal with the rest yourself. If any money comes of it, you'll give it to me."</p><p>Ever since work on the manuscript began and up to the present day there have been many why's connected with this book. It is like a living thing. It drew people to it and with their help forced its way into public life.</p><p>I wrote off the events connected with it as coincidences. Nevertheless, all these coincidences fit into a chain of logically structured links. Now I can't distinguish coincidence from the logical result of events. It's become hard to tell them apart.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0216>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>16. Father Feodorit</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>The moment came when I felt I could meet with Father Feodorit. In the taiga, I had asked Anastasia, "Are there people in our world who have the same abilities and knowledge as you, but who don't live as far away?"</p><p>"In various corners of the Earth there are people whose way of life is different from the technocratic one," Anastasia replied. "They have different abilities. But even in your world, there is someone you could easily reach winter and summer. The strength of his Spirit is great."</p><p>"Do you know where he lives? Can I see him and talk with him?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Who is he?"</p><p>"He is your father, Vladimir."</p><p>"What? Oh, Anastasia, Anastasia. . . . I so wanted to hear proofs that you were right, but it's all come out just the opposite. My father died eighteen years ago and is buried in a small town in Bryansk Province."</p><p>Anastasia was sitting on the grass and leaning against a tree, her knees pulled close. Silently looking me in the eye, her gaze was a little sad and regretful. Then she dropped her head to her knees. I thought she was upset over her mistake regarding my father, so I tried to console her.</p><p>"Anastasia, don't get so upset. You probably made that mistake because, as you yourself said, you have so little strength left." (This conversation occurred after she had lost consciousness trying to save a man and a woman from retribution, an incident I described in the first book.)</p><p>Anastasia was silent a little longer, then she lifted her head and once again looking me in the eye, said, "I do have less strength, but not so much less that I could make a mistake."</p><p>Then she went on to relate events that had occurred twenty-six years before, to set forth the past accurately and in detail, while lending it the nuances of private feelings.</p><p>Somehow, I was able to understand that from the outward, barely noticeable facial expression, posture, and eyes, you can determine the thoughts of whoever you're talking to. But how she viewed the past as if it were a documentary remains a mystery.</p><p>Anastasia herself could not explain this in normal, understandable language either.</p><p>She said, "Not far from Moscow is the Troitse-Sergiev Monastery, located in Sergiev Posad. Behind its thick ancient walls there is a seminary, an academy, churches, and an abbey.</p><p>"The churches are open to the public, and anyone who wants to can come and pray in this holy place of ancient Russia. Even in the days when believers were persecuted, they were not destroyed and there was the seminary, academy, and abbey, where co-partaker monks served God behind these walls.</p><p>"Twenty-six years before, on the day I came into this world, a young man walked through the gates of the Troitse-Sergiev Monastery. He visited the museum and then proceeded to the main church. A tall, gray-haired monk was reading the homily in the church. Both his height and his rank were exalted.</p><p>"This was Father Feodorit, the archpriest of the Troitse-Sergiev Monastery. The young man listened to the homily, and when Father Feodorit moved away, he followed him into the treasury. The church's servants did not stop the young man. Walking up to Father Feodorit, he began talking to him about the homily.</p><p>"Father Feodorit spoke with him for a long time. The young man had been baptized, but he did not possess sufficient faith, did not observe the fasts, did not take communion, and did not attend church regularly, but that day a friendship began between Father Feodorit and the young man.</p><p>"When the young man would come to the abbey, Father Feodorit would talk to him and show him holy objects to which ordinary parishioners did not have access. The monk gave him books, which he lost. The monk put a cross around the young man's neck, but the cross was lost as well.</p><p>"The monk gave the young man a second cross, an unusual one—the cross opened up like a locket—but it too was lost. The monk even brought the young man to his meal and sat him down at the same table with the abbey's monks. Each time, he gave him a little money. He never reproached him for anything and indeed always looked forward to his visit.</p><p>"This went on for a year. The young man spent time at the abbey every week, but one day he left and a week later had still not come. The monk waited. A month passed and then a year, and still the young man did not come. The monk waited.</p><p>"Now twenty-five years have passed. The monk has been waiting. For twenty-five years, Vladimir, your spiritual father, the Great Monk of Russia, Father Feodorit, has been waiting for you."</p><p>"I went far away from the abbey. To Siberia. I've thought about Father Feodorit from time to time," I replied as if trying to justify myself to myself or someone else.</p><p>"But you didn't write him a single letter," Anastasia noted.</p><p>"I want to see him."</p><p>"And what will you tell him? Maybe how you made money, were lucky in love, and simply lost your way? How many times were you on the brink of ruin but at the last moment disaster pulled back?</p><p>"He himself will see all this when he takes one look at you. He has been praying for your sins and has saved you so many times with his prayers. He still believes the way he did twenty-five years ago. He wanted something else from you."</p><p>"What, Anastasia? What does he know? What does he want?"</p><p>"I haven't been able to sort that out. He sensed it intuitively. Tell me, Vladimir, do you remember your conversations with him? Do you remember what you saw in the monastery treasuries?"</p><p>"I remember it all very vaguely. It was a long time ago, after all. I can only remember individual episodes."</p><p>"Try to remember them, and I will help you."</p><p>"Each time, Father Feodorit talked to me in different places in the abbey. I remember certain underground or half-underground rooms. I remember the dining hall, the long table, the monks eating dinner at it, and me with them. This was during some fast. The food was Lenten, but I liked it."</p><p>"Did you have unusual sensations or feelings when you visited the abbey?"</p><p>"Once after dinner, I went out through an abbey passage into the monastery's inner courtyard and headed for the gates. They were closed to parishioners. The courtyard was empty. The thick high walls kept the noise of the town out. All around there was nothing but churches and silence.</p><p>"I stopped. I thought I heard magnificent music. I needed to leave. A monk was standing on duty by the gates in order to let me out and draw the bolts on the gates. But I kept standing there listening to this music, and then I walked slowly toward the gates."</p><p>"Did you ever hear that music again? Did you ever experience that feeling?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Did you ever try to hear the music again and call up this sensation?"</p><p>"Yes, but I never could. I even stood in that same spot when I went the next time, but unfortunately . . ."</p><p>"Try to remember something else, Vladimir."</p><p>"You're interrogating me. You told that part of my life twenty-six years ago so accurately, you tell me what I felt then."</p><p>"That's impossible. Father Feodorit did not make specific plans, but he was counting on something intuitively and did something great and significant for you, something known only to him. I too only sense it intuitively: he was thinking of something significant and did a great deal for that—a very great deal.</p><p>"But why he associated what he desired with you, who hadn't even the elementary abilities for quickly arriving at faith remains a puzzle. Why twenty-five years of this dissolute life of yours did not break this faith is also a puzzle.</p><p>"And why do you, who was given so much, continue to do nothing? I can't understand it. After all, nothing in the Universe vanishes without a trace. Please try to remember at least a few individual episodes from the meetings and conversations with your Father."</p><p>"I remember a hall or some kind of treasury in the religious academy or seminary, but maybe this was one of the abbey's underground rooms. Some monk opened a door for Father Feodorit, but he himself did not go in. Father Feodorit and I went in together. There were pictures on the walls and things on the shelves."</p><p>"You expressed surprise there twice. At what?"</p><p>"Surprise? Yes, of course, it did surprise me. Amazed me, in fact."</p><p>"What did?"</p><p>"One picture. It was black and white, as if it had been drawn with pencil. It was a very precisely drawn portrait of a person."</p><p>"So what surprised you so much?"</p><p>"I don't remember."</p><p>"Try to remember, Vladimir. Please try to remember and I'll help you. A small room, you and Father Feodorit are standing together in front of this picture—you a little in front—and the father says to you, 'Step a little closer to the picture, Vladimir.' You took a step forward, then another step . . ."</p><p>"I remember! Anastasia!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"The picture of this person was drawn with just a single line. A pulsing, spiraling line. Drawn as if he had placed his pencil, or whatever people draw pictures with, in the middle of a sheet of white paper and drawn his instrument in a spiral without picking up, but pressing on it to broaden the line, or barely touching the page, which made the line very fine, but never breaking off.</p><p>"The line-spiral ended at the edge of the page, and the result was an amazing picture, the portrait of some person."</p><p>"That picture needs to be exhibited for viewing by everyone who wishes to see it. Someone may be able to decode the information put into it. Through the pulsing line that depicts a person people are supposed to become aware of something."</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"I don't know yet. Well, for example, the dots and dashes might look like some kind of alphabet or musical notation. I'm only suggesting. Either one is possible or even something else. When you go back, ask them to exhibit it for general viewing or to publish it somewhere. The person who can decode this line-spiral will turn up."</p><p>"But who is going to listen to me?"</p><p>"They'll listen to you. But that time you experienced something else very unusual. Can you remember what it was?"</p><p>"In that room or an adjoining space. . . . Yes, in a very small space there was a handsome raised carved wooden chair, or maybe it was an armchair, that looked like a throne. Father Feodorit and I stood there looking at it. Father Feodorit said no one ever touched it."</p><p>"But you did. You even sat on it."</p><p>"Father Feodorit himself suggested I do that."</p><p>"And at that moment something happened to you."</p><p>"Nothing. I sat there and looked at Father Feodorit, and he stood there and silently looked into my eyes. He just looked."</p><p>"Please remember, Vladimir, try to remember your inner feelings. They are what is most important."</p><p>"Nothing special, just these thoughts racing through my mind, very quickly, like a cassette tape on fast forward so that the words blurred into unintelligible sounds."</p><p>"Did you ever try to make sense of them, Vladimir? Afterwards, did you ever feel like stopping that tape in order to hear it at normal speed and understand the sound it was making?"</p><p>"How's that?"</p><p>"To give some thought to the essence of being."</p><p>"No, I didn't. You're not making sense."</p><p>"Did you understand everything Father Feodorit said to you? Could you remember precisely just one sentence, even if it has no connection to all the rest?"</p><p>"Yes, but I really can't remember what it's connected with."</p><p>"Tell me."</p><p>"'You will show them.'"</p><p>Anastasia, who had been sitting under the tree, suddenly stood up, her face beaming. She placed her palms on the Cedar's trunk and pressed her cheek to it.</p><p>"Yes! Of course!" Anastasia exclaimed. She clapped her hands and began speaking joyfully.</p><p>"Truly you are great, monk of Russia! You know, Vladimir, there is one thing I can definitely say now about Father Feodorit. He made many of the world's teachings ridiculous by pointing to the main thing."</p><p>"We didn't talk about any teachings at all. We discussed ordinary everyday topics."</p><p>"Yes! Of course! Ordinary ones! Father Feodorit talked to you about what was bothering you. He showed you sacred creations, treating them with respect but not servile, ostentatious veneration.</p><p>"Given high rank, he was simple and, most important, reflective, perhaps especially in your presence. He didn't express a single dogma. Compared to him, aren't the proselytizers ridiculous—those who have flooded into Russia expounding their dogmas and taking people away from the main thing?</p><p>"He walled you off so well from dogmas that you take even me for a naïve hermit. But it doesn't matter who I am. What matters is not to get away from the main thing."</p><p>"What main thing?"</p><p>"What there is in each person."</p><p>"But how can each person know the teachings of the sages of the West or East, India and Tibet, if he's never even heard of them?"</p><p>"Absolutely all the essential information is placed in the human being, Vladimir, in each person, from the very beginning. He is given it immediately at birth. Like his arms, legs, heart, and hair. All the teachings of the world, all the discoveries, derive only from this Source.</p><p>
<p>"Just as parents try to give each child of theirs everything, so too the Great Creator gives each person everything immediately. Nothing made by man—not the mountains of books, not the most modern and future computers, all taken together—will ever be able to hold even a portion of the information contained in a single person. You just have to know how to use it."</p><p>"Then why don't people make all these discoveries? Why doesn't each person create a body of teachings?"</p><p>"Someone will receive a grain of Truth from the total volume. He will repeat It admiringly and believe that It has been given to him alone, and that It holds the foundation.</p><p>"He will repeat It to others and try to force them to think about It alone as fundamental and singular. Consequently, he shuts himself off from the complete body of basic information. Knowledge of Truths does not lie in your profession of them, but in your way of life."</p><p>"And what way of life is characteristic for those who know the Truth best?"</p><p>"A happy one!"</p><p>"But knowing the Truth requires awareness and purity of intentions."</p><p>"Mysticism! Fantasy!" Anastasia laughed and added through her laughter, "Were you reading my thoughts?</p><p>"There is no mysticism here—simply an attentive attitude toward the person. You always reduce everything to purity of intentions and awareness."</p><p>"Mysticism! Mysticism!" Anastasia repeated, laughing. "You're reading my thoughts. This is fantastic!"</p><p>I couldn't resist her amusement and burst out laughing, too. Then I asked, "What do you think, Anastasia. Will my spiritual Father Feodorit receive me if I go to see him? Will he talk to me? Won't he be upset?"</p><p>"Of course he'll receive you and rejoice in your coming! He will receive you however you are. Only he will experience greater joy if you have grasped and done at least something with the information you possess. Stop the fast-forwarded tape, Vladimir, and you'll understand a lot."</p><p>"Is my Father still living in the same abbey? At the Troitse-Sergiev Monastery?"</p><p>"Your Father, this great elder of Russia, now lives in a small hermitage in the forest not far from the Troitse-Sergiev Monastery. The hermitage's rules are stricter than the abbey's, and your Father is the hermitage's abbot. The hermitage lies in the forest, in an uncommonly beautiful place.</p><p>"There are just a few small buildings with cells, as well as a small wooden church in this forest hermitage. It's unpainted and its cupola ungilded, but it is very, very beautiful, comfortable, and clean, and it has two heating stoves. Unlike most other churches, candles are neither bought nor sold there.</p><p>"Nothing there is bought or sold. No one and nothing has defiled it, and parishioners have no access to the hermitage. Father Feodorit is praying in this church right now. He prays for the salvation of the Souls of all people and you.</p><p>"He is praying for offspring who have forgotten their parents, praying for parents forgotten by their children. Go to him and bow. Ask him for absolution. The strength of his Spirit is great. Bow to Father Feodorit for me as well."</p><p>"Fine, Anastasia, I will. And you know, first I will probably try to do what you've asked."</p><p class=section>* * *</p><p>When I arrived at Sergiev Posad, the little town outside Moscow previously called Zagorsk, I walked through the gates of the Troitse-Sergiev Monastery, as I had twenty-seven years before. I headed immediately toward the entrance to the active abbey.</p><p>Before, when I introduced myself I could easily summon Father Feodorit. But now the monk on duty replied that Father Feodorit was not the archpriest. There was a Father Feodorit in the abbey, but he lived in the forest apart from the abbey.</p><p>Parishioners did not go there. I told the monk that I knew Father Feodorit, and to convince him I named the sacred objects of the monastery that Father Feodorit had shown me.</p><p>He then told me where the forest hermitage was located. I was inexplicably agitated as I approached the small wooden forest church. It was unusually beautiful, blending harmoniously into its natural environment. Paths led to the church from the few small wooden monk cells situated not far from it.</p><p>Father Feodorit and I met on the forest church's wooden porch. I became flustered even as I recalled Anastasia's words: "Don't be embarrassed and try not to be surprised when you meet your Father." However, the vague sense of confusion would not pass.</p><p>Father Feodorit was old and gray, but no older than twenty-seven years before. We sat on blocks of wood, on the forest church porch, and were silent. I tried to say something, but I couldn’t find what I needed to say.</p><p>He seemed to know everything anyway and it made no sense to utter the words. It was as if we had parted only yesterday, not twenty-seven years before.</p><p>I had brought Father Feodorit my book about Anastasia, but I hadn't given it to him. I'd shown the book to various priests. Some had looked at it and said they didn't read such books. Others asked what it was about and, after my brief story, pronounced Anastasia a pagan.</p><p>I didn't want to distress Father Feodorit, and I didn't want him to reject her. Whenever anyone tried to say anything bad about Anastasia, a feeling of antagonism arose in me.</p><p>I had even argued with a priest at the Novospassky Monastery. He pointed out two women in black scarves and dark clothing to me and said, "That is how God-fearing women behave."</p><p>I answered him, "If Anastasia is cheerful and full of life, that may be what God wants. It is more pleasant to look at people full of life than on downcast people like those two."</p><p>Agitated, I took out my book and handed it to Father Feodorit. He took it calmly and placed it in his open hand. Slowly he stroked it with his other palm, as if sensing something with his hands, and said, "Do you want me to read it?" Without waiting for my answer, he added, "Fine, leave it with me."</p><p>Two days later, in the morning, I went to see Father Feodorit again. We sat in the forest on a very small bench, near Father Feodorit's cell. We were talking about everything. His conversational manner hadn't changed from twenty-seven years before, but one very strange circumstance would give me no rest. Why did Father Feodorit look even a little younger than he had twenty-seven years before? Suddenly, interrupting his own thoughts, he spoke.</p><p>"Vladimir, your Father Feodorit died."</p><p>At first I was upset. Then I asked, "Who are you, then?"</p><p>"I am Father Feodorit," and he looked at me with a barely noticeable smile.</p><p>Once again I asked, "Tell me, where is his grave?"</p><p>"In the old cemetery."</p><p>"I want to see it. How do I find it?"</p><p>He did not answer about the grave, saying only, "Come see me when you have the time."</p><p>And then something completely incomprehensible began to happen.</p><p>"It's time for dinner," Father Feodorit said. "Let's go, and I'll feed you." I sat at the table in the small dining house. There was a pot of borscht on the table, mashed potatoes with fish, and stewed fruit. He ladled out the borscht for me, and I began to eat. Father Feodorit himself did not eat. He just sat at the table.</p><p>When I started eating the potatoes, I liked them very much. Then I remembered—they tasted exactly as they had at the abbey dining hall twenty-seven years before. I had remembered that all my life. My head was spinning.</p><p>On the one hand, this was another Father Feodorit next to me; on the other, he was speaking and behaving exactly as he had before. I remembered how once, many years before, when we were in one of the abbey's rooms, Father Feodorit had suggested we have our photograph taken together. I'd agreed.</p><p>He called in a monk with a camera who took our picture. I decided to clarify the situation. I knew that monks did not like to pose.</p><p>I thought that now I would suggest that Father Feodorit and the forest church be photographed on color film. If he refused, that would mean he was the wrong Father Feodorit, not mine. So I suggested, "Let's take our photograph together."</p><p>Father Feodorit did not refuse, and we took our picture. I photographed that beautiful church, too. It turned out well, even though my camera was quite basic.</p><p>As I was leaving, Father Feodorit gave me a small travel Bible. Inside it was written not in verse, as in most Bibles, but as prose, as in books. He explained, "When you quote the Bible in your book, you have to specify the chapter you're quoting."</p><p>To my request that he receive and speak to people wishing to meet with Anastasia, so they would not have to travel so far into the Siberian taiga, Father Feodorit replied, "You know, I still haven't sorted this out entirely for myself. Come alone for now, when you have the time."</p><p>Father Feodorit's refusal disappointed me, but I did not insist. Talking with him about different things, I concluded that in Russia's monasteries there are elders whose wisdom and simplicity of explanation greatly exceed the many proselytizers of both imported religions and our own.</p><p>Yet why are you silent, you wise elders of Russia? Because of your own understanding, or do dark forces prevent you from speaking? You come to church for a service in a language people don't understand.</p><p>This drives crowds to pay money to hear missionaries speaking in a language they don't understand. Maybe that's why swarms of Russians travel to sacred places overseas, forgetting their own.</p><p>I always felt very good after being with Father Feodorit. He spoke more simply, clearly, and understandably than the many missionaries I'd heard since meeting Anastasia in order to understand what she said. I wanted others to feel good, too.</p><p>When will you speak up, wise elders of Russia?</p><p><div class=chapter id=0217>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>17. The Dimension of Love</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p>After the first printing of my book about Anastasia sold out, I received a royalty. I went to what is now the All-Union Exhibition Center. For some reason, I liked spending time there.</p><p>I walked past the many snack bars and open shashlyk stands luring me with delicious smells, and I fought the desire to buy all this delicious food. Although I had money in my pocket—and a considerable sum, to boot—I decided to be thrifty.</p><p>Then something incredible happened. I heard Anastasia's voice, not loud, but perfectly distinct: "Buy yourself something to eat, Vladimir. Buy what you want. You don't need to deny yourself nourishment."</p><p>I took a few more steps past open shashlyk stands and once again the voice asked, "Why are you walking by? Eat a little, please, Vladimir."</p><p>"Good heavens, what an hallucination!" I thought.</p><p>I walked toward a bench on the promenade, a little away from people. I sat there and quietly whispered, leaning over, so people wouldn't think I was talking to myself.</p><p>"Anastasia, am I really hearing your voice?"</p><p>In reply I heard right then, distinctly and clearly, "You are hearing my voice, Vladimir."</p><p>"Hello, Anastasia. Why haven't you spoken to me before? I have so many questions. Readers ask questions at gatherings, and there are a lot I can't answer."</p><p>"I have spoken. I have been trying to speak to you the whole time. But you don't hear me.</p><p>"The day you decided to commit suicide, I even shouted, I was so upset. It didn't help. You didn't hear me. Then I had an idea and started singing. Two young women started playing this song on their violins in the subway. They heard it and began to play along.</p><p>"As soon as you heard the melody of the song I sang for you in the taiga, you thought of me. I was so upset then, I nearly lost my milk."</p><p>"What milk, Anastasia?"</p><p>"My breast milk. The milk for our son. I've given birth to him, Vladimir."</p><p>"Given birth . . . Anastasia, are you having a hard time? How are you doing alone with the child in the taiga? How is he? I remember you said, 'But it won't be at the right time.'"</p><p>"Everything's fine. Spring awoke early and is helping me now. Our son is fine. He's a sturdy boy. He's already smiling. His skin is a little dry, like yours, but that's all right. It will pass.</p><p>"Everything will be fine. You'll see. It's going to be harder for you now than us. But take another step. Finish writing.</p><p>"I know how hard it was for you, and there are some hard times yet to come. But you must continue. Continue on your path."</p><p>"Yes, Anastasia."</p><p>I wanted to tell her that writing the book was harder than doing business. I wanted to tell her about the situation in my family and firm—basically, about all the unexpected reversals of the previous year.</p><p>I wanted to tell her how I nearly ended up in the loony bin. I wanted to give my opinion that she shouldn't lure people with her dreams anymore, but I thought, Why upset a nursing mother? She might lose her milk.</p><p>So I said to her, "Don't you worry over trifles, Anastasia. I'm not having any particular difficulties whatsoever. Just think, I wrote a book. That's easier than compiling a business plan.</p><p>"When you compile a business plan, you have to anticipate so many different nuances. But here you take a seat and describe what's already happened. Like in the joke about the Chukchi: 'I sing what I see.'</p><p>"And also . . .</p><p>"You know, Anastasia, they may seem mere fantasy, but your dreams are coming true. It's hard to believe, but they are.</p><p>"Here it is, the book has been written. You dreamed of it, and now it exists. People truly are reading it with interest. The big city newspapers are writing about it now.</p><p>"Readers are composing poems about you, nature, and Russia. I found the painting in the Troitse-Sergiev Monastery treasury you and I spoke of. The picture has survived and is called 'One as One.' I'm going to publish it.</p><p>"Imagine, the bards—you remember telling me about the bards?"</p><p>"Yes, I remember, Vladimir."</p><p>"Just think, that's starting to come true, too. At one readers' conference, a dark blond man came up to me, handed me an audiocassette, and said curtly, military fashion, 'Songs for Anastasia. I beg of you, accept them.'</p><p>"Journalists, readers, and associates of the Moscow Research Center who had come to the conference listened to the cassette in silence. Then different people started copying it. Copying it and searching for the short, dark blond man, who wasn't much to look at but who had turned up so suddenly and left just as suddenly.</p><p>"He turned out to be a submarine officer from St. Petersburg—the scholar Aleksandr Korotynsky.</p><p>"He later told me how their submarine had been raised after an accident. How a chain of coincidences had confidently led him to the cassette so that he could hand it to me.</p><p>"Aleksandr Korotynsky turned out to be a bard as well. His song 'Temple' contains entire sentences spoken by you. Like these, remember?</p><p>Don't believe what others tell you</p><p>When they say all this will pass.</p><p>Many are those who see the Temple,</p><p>But few will go inside.</p><p>Our life may race</p><p>Through different stages,</p><p>But each and every one of us</p><p>Has made his own choice.</p><p>"Also, Korotynsky doesn't have a singer's voice. He practically speaks the lyrics. But it is this that confirmed what you said about the power of words connected to the soul by invisible threads. The bard Korotynsky demonstrated this in real life."</p><p>"Thank you, bard, for the light joy you have brought people, for the cleansing of souls, thank you," Anastasia said.</p><p>"Imagine, another officer! Grutsya is an officer, too, and he was the first to print the book. Furthermore, a homeless colonel drew the picture for it.</p><p>"And the pilot, the regimental commander, who helped sell the books.</p><p>"Now the first to bring songs was an officer, too. Why does your Ray set fire to officers' souls? Do you shine it more on them than others?"</p><p>"My Ray has touched many, but aspirations are ignited only where there is something to burn."</p><p>"Your dream, Anastasia, is becoming a reality after all. People are picking up on it, understanding it. The homeless colonel understood. I met him by chance, and I'm sorry he died.</p><p>"I saw him lying there, dead. His whole face was smeared with dirt, but he was smiling. Dead, but smiling. Was it you who did something with your Ray? What does it mean when a man dies with a smile?"</p><p>"That man who was with you—he's with the bard right now, on the invisible path. His smile will save many hearts from bullets more terrible than lead."</p><p>"Your dream is entering our world, Anastasia, and the world seems to be starting to change. Some people have sensed and understood you. Powers have appeared in them out of somewhere, and they are making changes.</p><p>"The world is getting a little better. But you're still there, in the taiga, in your glade. I couldn't live in the conditions you do, just as you couldn't live in our world.</p><p>"Then why is your love needed? Your love makes no sense, and to this day I can't understand my own relationship to you. Why should I, when it's clear as it is that we will never be together? Side by side."</p><p>"We are together, Vladimir. Side by side."</p><p>"Together? Where are you? When people love, they try to stay by each other's side always, to embrace and caress. You're unusual. You don't need that."</p><p>"I do need that—the same as everyone—and I have it."</p><p>"But how?"</p><p>"Like right now. Don't you feel the breeze's gentle touch and its fond embrace? And the warm touch of the Sun's ray? How the birds sing for you, and the leaves rustle on the tree you're sitting under! Listen closely. Isn't it an unusual rustling?"</p><p>"But this—everything you've named—is for everyone. You mean this is all you?"</p><p>"Love that has dissolved in space for one person can touch many souls."</p><p>"Why dissolve love in space?"</p><p>"So the Dimension of Love will always be near your beloved. Here lies love's essence and purpose."</p><p>"All this doesn't seem to make sense. And your voice . . . I've never heard at a distance before, and now I do. Why?"</p><p>"It's not the voice you're hearing at a distance. You have to listen with your heart, not your ears, and you will learn to with your heart."</p><p>"Why learn that when you can always speak with your voice, like now?"</p><p>"I won't always be able to."</p><p>"But you're speaking right now. I can hear you."</p><p>"My grandfather is helping us now. Talk to him for a while. I need to go feed our son and I have many other things to do. I so want to do it all."</p><p>"So your grandfather can, but you can't. Why?"</p><p>"Because my grandfather is somewhere nearby right now. Very close to you."</p><p>"Where?"</p><p><div class=chapter id=0218>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>18. Anastasia's Grandfather</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p>I looked from side to side. Anastasia's grandfather was standing almost next to a shop pushing a piece of paper someone had dropped on the lawn toward the trashbin with his stick. I leapt up. He and I shook hands.</p><p>His eyes were cheerful and good, and he was easy to be with. Not like her great-grandfather. When I saw her great-grandfather in the taiga, he was silent the entire time, and his eyes looked into space as if he were looking through you.</p><p>Her grandfather and I sat down on the bench and I asked him, "How did you get here and find me?"</p><p>"It's not so difficult with Anastasia's help."</p><p>"My goodness, she gave birth. She said she was going to, and she did—alone, in the taiga, not a hospital. It must have hurt, right? Did she cry out?"</p><p>"Why do you think it should have hurt?"</p><p>"Well, when women give birth, it hurts. Some even die in labor."</p><p>"It only hurts when the person is conceived in sin, as a result of carnal pleasures. The woman pays for this with labor pains and the torments of life thereafter. If the conception came about with other aspirations, the pain merely intensifies the birthing woman's sense of the great joy of creation."</p><p>"What happens to the pain? How can it intensify joy?"</p><p>"When a woman is raped, what does she experience? Pain, of course, and revulsion. But when she gives herself freely, the same pain shifts into other sensations. It's the same kind of difference in labor."</p><p>"You mean Anastasia gave birth without pain?"</p><p>"Naturally without pain. And she chose an appropriate day, warm and sunny."</p><p>"How did she choose? After all, women give birth unexpectedly."</p><p>"Unexpectedly when they conceive inadvertently. The mother can always delay or speed up the baby's appearance by a few days."</p><p>"Didn't you know when she was supposed to give birth? Didn't you try to help her?"</p><p>"We sensed it that day. It was a beautiful day. We went to her glade. At the edge of the glade, we saw the bear. The bear was roaring in insult. Roaring and pawing the earth as hard as it could. Anastasia lay on the same spot where her mother had given birth to her, and the little bundle was alive on her breast. The wolf cub was licking him."</p><p>"But why was the bear roaring? What was it angry about?"</p><p>"Anastasia had called for the wolf cub, not the bear."</p><p>"It could have approached itself."</p><p>"They never approach without being asked. Imagine the pandemonium there would be if they approached without being asked, whenever they wanted."</p><p>"I wonder how she's doing with the child now?"</p><p>"You could go and take a look, if you're wondering."</p><p>"She said I shouldn't be around him until I cleanse myself of something here. First, I must travel to holy places, but I don't have the money."</p><p>"What do you care what that alogical woman said? You're the father. You should act as you see fit. You could buy him all kinds of rompers and diapers, little jackets, and rattles, and you could demand she dress the child normally and not torment him. Otherwise he's completely naked in the forest."</p><p>"I wanted to see my son as soon as I heard about him. That's what I'll do. You hit the nail on the head about her being alogical. That must be why I have these incomprehensible feelings for her—first amazement, now respect—but still there's something else I don't understand.</p><p>"But it's not like love for a woman. I remember what it felt like before when I would fall in love with a woman. Now it's something else. It's probably impossible to love her in an ordinary way. Something interferes. Maybe it's her being alogical that interferes."</p><p>"Anastasia is alogical, Vladimir, not stupid. Her apparent alogic derives from forgotten spiritual laws from the depths of the Universe and may also create new ones.</p><p>"The forces of light and darkness fade away sometimes because she seems to stand outside the bounds of logic, but later the simple Truth of being known to all suddenly flares up more brightly. We can't always understand our Anastasia either, even though she is our granddaughter. She grew up before our eyes. But since we don't always understand, we can't help in any substantial way.</p><p>"Because of that, she is often alone in her aspirations, completely alone. She met you and opened up to you and others completely through the book. We wanted to prevent that. We wanted to prevent her love. Her choice seemed incomprehensible and absurd."</p><p>"Even now I don't understand her choice. Readers ask questions, too. 'Who are you?' 'Why did Anastasia choose you?' I can't answer. I realize that it would be more appropriate for her to have a scientist or a religious man by her side.</p><p>"He would be able to understand and love her. Together, they would bring about much more good, while I have to change my life and sort out many issues that have long been clear and understandable to others more enlightened."</p><p>"Do you regret that your life has changed?"</p><p>"I don't know. I'm still trying to make sense of it all. As to why she chose me, I just can't say. I've searched for an answer but haven't found one."</p><p>"How have you searched for the answer?"</p><p>"I've been trying inwardly to figure out who I am."</p><p>"You may be outstanding in some way. Am I right?"</p><p>"I think there may be something. They say like attracts like."</p><p>"Vladimir, did Anastasia talk to you about pride and egotism? Did she talk about the consequences of that sin?"</p><p>"Yes, she said it was a mortal sin that led man away from the Truth."</p><p>"She didn't choose you, Vladimir. She picked you up. She picked you up as something no one needed and that had had its day. We didn't figure this out right away either. Are you hurt?"</p><p>"I don't quite agree with you. I had a family, a wife and daughter, and my business affairs were going fairly well. I might not be outstanding, but I'm not so bad that I had to be picked up like a bum or someone unneeded and abandoned."</p><p>"Lately there had been no love between you and your wife. You had your own life and interests, and she had hers. Only daily life kept you together—or rather, the inertia of past feelings that had faded more and more with time.</p><p>"You and your daughter had nothing to talk about. Your business did not interest her. Only to you did it seem important. It brought in material income. Today income, tomorrow nothing or a loss, ruin.</p><p>"And you were ill. You had nearly destroyed your stomach. With your dissolute way of life you would never have scrambled out of your illness. It was all over. There was nothing left."</p><p>"What's it to you? What does she need me for? An experiment? Had she done some kind of calculation?"</p><p>"She simply came to love you, Vladimir, sincerely, as she does everything. And she's happy she did not take anyone from your world who was capable of bringing joy to another woman. She did not put herself in a privileged position. She is glad to be like all women."</p><p>"You mean this is her whim? She wants to be like all women? I smoked, I ran around. . . . Just think! What self-sacrifice for a whim!"</p><p>"Her love is sincere, without whim or calculation. At first, her acts appeared alogical to the forces of light and dark, to us and others, but in reality she shed a bright light on the concept and meaning of Love—not with words, teachings, or moral admonitions, but by the real accomplishments in your life.</p><p>"The forces of light and the Creator speak through her Love. They don't just talk, they demonstrate it in waking life in a way no one ever has before. See what the power of woman, the power of pure Love, is like.</p><p>"In the moment before death, she can give new life. She can lift up her beloved, tear him from the tenacious paws of darkness, and carry him into the infinity of light. She can surround him with the Dimension of Love and give him a second life, eternal life.</p><p>"Vladimir, her Love will restore your wife's love and your daughter's respect. Thousands of women will gaze at you ardently. You will have complete freedom of choice. And if, out of all the diversity of the outward manifestation of love, you are able to see and understand this one, she will be happy.</p><p>"In any event, you will be famous and rich and nothing will be able to ruin you. The book you wrote will fly over the world and not only make you money but give you and others strength greater than material or physical strength."</p><p>"The book truly is beginning to sell well. But I wrote it myself, though some people say that Anastasia helped, too, in some way. What do you think? Is this my book alone, or did I write it with her participation?"</p><p>"You went through all the motions of a writer. You chose the paper and ran a pen over it, describing what had happened. You set forth a few of your own conclusions in language characteristic of you alone. You arranged for the book's publication. Your actions in no way differed from a writer's usual actions."</p><p>"You mean the book is mine alone? Anastasia did none of it?"</p><p>"No, she didn't. She didn't run the pen over the paper."</p><p>"You talk as if she nonetheless did help in some way. If that's the case, say so more clearly. What did she do?"</p><p>"Anastasia gave up her life so you could write this book, Vladimir."</p><p>"There, you see? This is all completely incomprehensible. Why? How could she, while living in the forest, give up her life for some book? Who is she? She says, 'a human being.' Others call her an extraterrestrial, a goddess. You can get totally mixed up. I wish I could reach some sort of clarity for myself."</p><p>"It's all very simple, Vladimir. Man is the only creature in the Universe who lives on all levels of existence at once. Most people in their earthly essence see only the earthly, materialized manifestation. There are those who sense other invisible essences as well.</p><p>"The people who call Anastasia a goddess do not sin before the Truth. The main difference between man and everything else that exists is that man has been given the ability to create the present and future with his thoughts by creating shapes and images that subsequently materialize.</p><p>"The future depends on vividness and harmoniousness, how swift the Man-Creator's thought is, and how pure his intentions. In this sense Anastasia is a goddess, for the speed of her thought and the images she shapes are so vivid and pure that she alone has proved capable of countering the entire dark mass of opposites.</p><p>"Alone. However, we have no idea how long she is going to be able to withstand this. She keeps waiting and believing that people will grasp this and help her, that they will stop producing darkness and hell."</p><p>"Who is producing darkness and hell?"</p><p>"The soothsayers who believe and talk about disaster and the end of the world are themselves producing thoughts and shapes of the end of the world. Many predictions of the universal demise of humanity indeed bring it closer by their thoughts and shapings. There are a great many of them, and as they search for salvation and the promised land themselves, they never suspect that hell has been prepared specifically for them."</p><p>"But those people who talk about and believe in Judgment Day and disaster, don't they sincerely pray for the salvation of their Souls?"</p><p>"This is belief not in light and love, which God is and moves by, but in fear. Furthermore, they are readying this fearful thing for themselves. Think about it, Vladimir. Try to imagine. Here you and I are sitting on this bench. You see lots of people in front of you.</p><p>"All of a sudden, some double up with painful seizures. Supposedly, they are sinners. Around us on the ground are many decomposing bodies, but you and I are sitting here untouched, observing.</p><p>"Our bench seems to be in heaven. But won't your Soul explode from the horrible picture before you? Isn't it better to die, to fall asleep the moment before that insight?"</p><p>"But what if all the saved righteous men are taken to the promised land, which is free of decomposing bodies and horrific scenes?"</p><p>"When news arrives from the far end of the earth about the death of someone dear to you, don't you feel sadness and grief in your Soul?"</p><p>"Probably anyone would get upset."</p><p>"Then how you can you conceive of a heaven for yourself when you know that most of your fellow countrymen, friends, and relatives have already perished and others are dying in terrible suffering?</p><p>"To what degree does a Soul have to harden, what abyss of gloom does it have to plunge into, in order to rejoice while being aware of what is happening? Souls like that aren't needed in the kingdom of light. For it is they who create darkness."</p><p>"Then why do humanity's great teachers, who have written all kinds of teachings, talk about the end of the world and Judgment Day? Who are they then? Where are they leading people? Why do they speak this way?"</p><p>"It's hard to tell what they intend. Perhaps, having assembled crowds around themselves, they will produce a turnaround in consciousness due to the attractiveness of their ideas."</p><p>"People can produce a turnaround now. Yet those who came before, did they leave behind their teachings?"</p><p>"They, too, could have prepared a shift in thinking in hopes that their followers would carry it out and reveal the Truth. They may be waiting for events to teach the majority the dead end their path leads to, and events may help them turn those who come with and believe in them toward the light."</p><p>"If you knew all this, why did you keep silent in the forest for so many years? Why didn't you try to explain this to someone before? Anastasia said your clan has led this unique way of life for millennia, preserving the Truth of the Primary Sources, from generation to generation."</p><p>"In the different corners of the world there are people who have preserved a nontechnocratic way of life, preserving the abilities inherent in man alone.</p><p>"At various times, they have tried to share their awareness, but they have always perished before they could say the essential thing. They produced powerful shapes and images, but too many opposed them."</p><p>"You mean they would trample and destroy Anastasia, too?"</p><p>"In some incomprehensible way, Anastasia has been able to oppose them—at least, so far. Perhaps due to her being alogical or . . ." The old man fell silent, running his stick pensively over the ground, drawing incomprehensible symbols.</p><p>I thought a while and then asked him, "Why did she keep repeating to me, 'I am a human being, a woman,' if she is a Goddess, as you say?"</p><p>"In her earthly, materialized life, she is simply a person, simply a woman. Although her way of life is somewhat unusual, she, like all people, can be full of joy and sorrow, can love and want to be loved. All she possesses is inherent in man. Man in his original form.</p><p>"Her abilities that struck you as so strange do not seem so fantastic now that you have learned what your science says about them. Scientists will find explanations for many more of her currently incomprehensible abilities. They will all be trying to prove that she is simply a human being, simply a woman.</p><p>"There is one phenomenon you cannot understand merely by encountering it, although this awaits you. Science will not be able to explain it. My father doesn't even know what it is. We call something like this an anomaly. But I beg you, Vladimir, don't identify this phenomenon with Anastasia.</p><p>"It can occur alongside, but not in her. Try to find the strength inside yourself to see and feel the human being in her. She is trying to be like everyone else. For some reason, she feels it is important and necessary to prove she is a human being.</p><p>"This is hard for her because in doing this she cannot violate her principles. But doesn't each person have principles of his own?"</p><p>"What is this phenomenon you haven't defined and science cannot make sense of?"</p><p><div class=chapter id=0219>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>19. An Anomalous Phenomenon</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><img class=kumar src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Nastenkas-birthday-vk.com-kumar82.png></div> </p><p>"When we buried Anastasia's parents, she was very little. She couldn't walk or talk at all. My father and I dug the earth with the wild animals' help. We spread twigs over the bottom of the pit, laid the bodies of Anastasia's parents in it, covered them with grass, and sprinkled them with earth.</p><p>"We stood silently over the funeral mound. Little Anastasia was sitting close by in the glade, examining a bug crawling over her hand. 'It's good she can't yet comprehend the grief that has come to her,' we thought. Then we quietly left."</p><p>"What do you mean 'left'? You're telling me you abandoned a little girl who still didn't have her wits about her?"</p><p>"We didn't abandon her. We left her where her mother had given her birth. We have a concept: Shambala, Homeland. Homeland—rodina—comes from rod, 'birth' or 'kin.' Mother.</p><p>"Before a child appears in the world, his parents must shape a Dimension for him, a world of Good Will and Love, and give him a small piece of homeland—a rodina—which, like the womb, both protects the body and bestows kindness on the Soul. It gives him the wisdom of the universe and helps him acquire the Truth.</p><p>"What does a woman who gives birth inside stone walls give her child? What kind of world has she prepared for him? Did she even think about the world in which her child would have to live? The world will treat him as it pleases.</p><p>"It will try to subject the little human being to itself and make a slave of him, a cog. The mother becomes nothing more than an observer because she did not prepare a Dimension of Love for her child.</p><p>"You see, Vladimir, Anastasia's mother was treated by the Nature that surrounded her and the wild animals big and small the same as anyone who lived the way she did: as a friend, a wise and good Divinity who had created around herself a world of Love.</p><p>"Anastasia's parents were cheerful and good people. They loved each other very much, and they loved the earth. The Dimension that surrounded them returned their Love. Little Anastasia was born in the Dimension of this Love and became its center.</p><p>"Many wild animals do not harm newborns. A cat can nurse a puppy and a dog a kitten. Many wild animals are capable of feeding and nursing a human offspring. But these animals have become wild for you.</p><p>"For Anastasia's mother and father, they had a different purpose. The wild animals treated them differently. Anastasia's mother gave birth to her in the glade, and many animals observed the birth. They saw the human woman they respected becoming a mother and giving birth to another human.</p><p>"When they observed the birth, their feelings for their human friend—their love for her—became intertwined with their own maternal instinct, giving birth to something new, elevated, and light.</p><p>"The entire, absolutely the entire surrounding Dimension, from the tiniest bug and blade of grass to the outwardly menacing wild animal, was prepared to give its life without thinking for this little being.</p><p>"Nothing could threaten her in this Dimension of Homeland that was created and given by her mother and was all around her. Everyone would nurse and cherish this human being.</p><p>"For Anastasia, the little glade was like her mother's womb. The little glade was her living Homeland, mighty and good, and indissolubly linked to the Universe—to all the Great Creator's creation—by a living thread not made by human hand.</p><p>"The little glade was her living Homeland, her inheritance from her mother and father and from the One and First Father. We could not take its place. So after we buried Anastasia's parents, we left. Three days later, on a hike to the glade, we sensed a tension in the air and heard the wolves whining. Then we saw . . .</p><p>"Little Anastasia was sitting quietly on the burial mound. One cheek was dirty. We realized she had been sleeping on the grave. Tears were slipping from her eyes and falling on the mound. She was weeping almost without a sound, just letting out a sob once in a while. She kept stroking the burial mound with her little hands.</p><p>"Unable to speak, she said her first words at this mound. We heard them. First she said them syllable by syllable: 'Ma-ma,' and then, 'Pa-pa.' She repeated them a few times.</p><p>"Then she uttered more complicated words: 'Ma-moch-ka, pa-poch-ka, ma-moch-ka, pa-poch-ka. I'm Anastasia. I'll be here without you now. Right? Just with my grandfathers? Right?'</p><p>"My father was the first to realize that back when we were burying her parents, little Anastasia, sitting in the glade and examining the bug, had grasped the full depth of the grief that had befallen her. By an effort of will, she had not shown her feelings, so as not to upset us.</p><p>"She had taken in the wisdom and strength of the Primary Sources with her mother's milk. Nursing mothers have that opportunity, Vladimir. They can give their infant, while they are nursing, not only their milk but understanding and the wisdom of the ages, all the way back to the Primary Sources.</p><p>"Anastasia's mother knew how this was done and made full use of this method. The very fullest.</p><p>"Since Anastasia did not want us to see her crying, we did not go out into the glade or approach the grave, but we could not move from that spot. So we stood there, watching what was happening.</p><p>"Little Anastasia, resting her little hands on the burial mound, was trying to stand on her little legs. It didn't work the first time, but she did eventually manage to stand.</p><p>"She stood there swaying, her arms held out slightly to the sides, and finally took her first timid step from her parents' grave, and then one more. Her little feet got tangled in the grass, and her little body lost its balance and started to fall. But her fall . . . it was unusual.</p><p>"At the moment of her fall, suddenly, a barely visible bluish illumination flooded the glade, altering the Earth's gravitation locally. It touched us with a blessed languor as well.</p><p>"Anastasia's little body did not fall but rather dropped slowly and smoothly to the ground. When she got back up on her feet, the blue light disappeared, and gravity returned to normal.</p><div class=img><img src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ill-be-without-you-now-vk.com-kumar82.jpg></div><p>"Taking cautious steps and with periodic halts, Anastasia walked up to a small twig lying in the glade and was able to pick it up. We realized she had decided to tidy the glade the way her mother used to.</p><p>"The still tiny little girl carried the dry twig to the edge of the glade. But once again she lost her balance, started falling, and dropped the twig.</p><p>"As she fell, the blue light flared again, altering the Earth's gravity once more, and the twig flew off to a stack of dried branches lying at the edge of the glade.</p><p>"Anastasia stood up, looked for the twig, and couldn't find it. Then she held her little arms out to the side and slowly tottered toward another twig. Before she could lean over, the twig began to rise, as if a breeze had blown it aside.</p><p>"It cast the dry twig to the edge of the glade. But there wasn't enough wind around for that to happen. Some invisible someone was carrying out little Anastasia's desire.</p><p>"But she wanted to do everything herself, the way her mama had. Probably in protest against the help from her invisible ally, she raised her little arm up and waved it slightly.</p><p>"We looked up and saw it. Hanging over the glade, pulsing and radiating blue light, was a small spherical cluster. Many fiery charges, like multicolored lightning, darted inside its translucent covering. It looked like ball lightning, but big. But it was intelligent!</p><p>"We couldn't understand what its intelligence consisted of or what it was.</p><p>"In it we sensed a hitherto unknown and unseen might, yet we felt no fear. On the contrary, from it came a pleasant, languorous Grace, and we had no desire to move. We felt only like being."</p><p>"What made you decide it possessed unprecedented might?"</p><p>"My father noticed it. Even though the day was clear and the sun shone, the leaves on the trees and petals on the flowers had turned toward it rather than the Sun. Its bluish illumination held more power than the Sun's rays.</p><p>"It also changed the Earth's gravitation at the moment Anastasia's little body was falling, locally and precisely—so precisely that she dropped smoothly without losing contact with the Earth.</p><p>"Anastasia spent a long time collecting twigs, sometimes crawling, sometimes taking small, slow steps, walking through the glade, until she had picked them all up herself. The fiery, pulsating sphere directed itself toward the tiny child, but it no longer helped her clear the twigs. It was as if the mighty sphere had understood and obeyed the gesture of the child's little hand.</p><p>"Expanding and dissolving in the Dimension, contracting and producing flashes inside itself that looked like energy produced and extinguished by something unknown, it would vanish for an instant and then reappear, as if agitated and having rushed through the Universal Dimension with unimaginable speed.</p><p>"The time came when Anastasia usually fell asleep. We never force children to sleep, rocking them to the point of dizziness. At that time Anastasia's mama would simply lie down at the edge of the glade in the same place and seem to fall asleep, showing her by example.</p><p>"Little Anastasia would crawl over to her, press up against her warm body, and calmly fall asleep. This time, too, Anastasia went over to where she usually took a nap with her mother. She stood there and looked at the spot where her mother had always slept at that time, but now her mama wasn't there.</p><p>"We didn't know what she was thinking about at that moment, but once again a teardrop gleamed in a sunbeam on little Anastasia's cheek. The blue light immediately began to pulse through the glade, blinking irregularly.</p><p>"Anastasia looked up, saw the pulsing cloud, sat down on the grass, and watched it steadily. Under her gaze, it fell still. She looked at it for a while. Then she held both arms out to it, as she did when she summoned one of the wild animals.</p><p>"Right then, the sphere blazed with a great many powerful lightning bolts, which broke the bounds of the blue covering, and flew like a fiery comet toward her little hands.</p><p>"Able to clear everything in its path, it appeared by Anastasia's face in an instant and began to turn and with its lightning bolt seemed to tear away the teardrop shining on her cheek. All the flashes were immediately extinguished, and the sphere in the hands of the child sitting on the grass now glowed blue.</p><p>"For a while Anastasia held it, examined and stroked it. Then she stood up, lifted the blue sphere, stepping carefully, carried it a ways and placed it where she had slept with her mama. She stroked it again.</p><p>"It lay there and seemed to fall asleep, as Anastasia's mama used to. And Anastasia lay down on the grass beside it. She was sleeping on the grass, curled into a ball, when it suddenly flew up, vanishing into the heavens and then dissolving low over the glade, as if covering her with itself.</p><p>"Then, once again contracting into a small, pulsing sphere, it ended up next to Anastasia sleeping on the grass and stroked her hair. This was a strange and unusual stroking. It took and lifted each strand separately with its delicate, shining, quivering lightning-rays.</p><p>"Subsequently as we were arriving to visit Anastasia in her glade, we saw it several times more. We realized that for Anastasia it was something natural, like the Sun, the Moon, the trees, and the animals all around her.</p><p>"As with everything about her, she talked to it, but she also distinguished it from everything else, although this distinction had few outward signs.</p><p>"We felt she treated it with slightly more respect than everything else, but sometimes she gave it a little trouble. She never gave anyone any trouble, but with it, for some reason, she allowed herself to. It reacted to her mood and satisfied her whims.</p><p>"When Anastasia turned four, on her birthday, at dawn, we stood at the edge of the glade and waited for her to wake. We wanted to observe quietly as she rejoiced at the dawning of the spring day.</p><p>"It appeared a moment before her awakening, glowing blue and then dissolving throughout the glade. We saw a living picture, enchanting and beautiful, not made by human hands.</p><p>"The entire glade and the surrounding trees, grass, and bugs were transformed. The Cedars' needles were illuminated in different soft colors. The squirrels leaping on the branches trailed melting rainbows of light. The grass shone a gentle green.</p><p>"An even more vivid, multicolored illumination came from the many bugs moving in the grass, and together they comprised a living, flowing carpet of extraordinary beauty constantly transforming its beautiful, elaborate patterns.</p><p>"When she awoke, Anastasia opened her eyes, saw the extraordinary living picture full of enchantment, and jumped up, looking around.</p><p>"She smiled the way she always smiled in the morning, and her surroundings reacted to her smile with an even brighter illumination and quickening. Then Anastasia dropped carefully to her knees and began to examine closely the grass and the bugs moving and shining in different colors.</p><p>"When she looked up, she seemed both to be concentrating and a little worried. She looked up, and even though there was nothing overhead, she stretched her little arms to the sky. The still air instantly stirred, and the blue sphere appeared in her hands.</p><p>"She held it near her face, placed it on the grass, and stroked it tenderly. We heard their conversation. Only Anastasia spoke, but there was the full sense that it understood what she said and was silently trying to respond. Anastasia spoke tenderly to it and a little sadly.</p><p>"'You are good. You are very good. You wanted to please me with beauty. Thank you. But put it back, please. Put everything back the way it was before. And never change it again.'</p><p>"The blue sphere started pulsing, rose slightly above the ground, and lightning bolts flashed within it. But the shining picture did not disappear. Anastasia looked carefully at the sphere and spoke again.</p><p>"'Each little bug, beetle, and ant has a mama. Everyone has a mama. Mamas love their children just the way they're born. It doesn't matter how many legs they have or what color their body is. You changed everything. How are the mamas going to recognize their children now? Put it all back the way it was, please.'</p><p>"The sphere blinked slightly, and everything in the glade returned to the way it had been. It dropped by Anastasia's feet again. She stroked it and said, 'Thank you!' Then she fell silent, gazing attentively at the sphere. When she spoke, her words struck us.</p><p>"'Please don’t visit me anymore. I'm happy with you. You always try to do only good and to help, but don't visit me. I realize you have your own very big glade.</p><p>"'You think very fast, so fast I can't understand you right away. Only later do I understand just a little. You move faster than everyone, lots faster than the birds and the breeze. You do everything very fast and well, and I realize this is because you have to get everything done and do something good in your own very big glade.</p><p>"'But when you're with me, that means you're not there and there's no one to do good in the other glade. Go. You need to look after your own glade.'</p><p>"The blue sphere contracted into a very small mass and flew up. It dashed around the space, flared more brightly than usual, and once again sped like a fiery comet toward Anastasia, who was seated, and fell still next to her head. Many trembling rays reached toward Anastasia's long hair and stroked each strand individually to the very tip.</p><p>"'Well, what's keeping you? Hurry to those who are waiting for you,' Anastasia said softly. 'I will do everything good here myself. It will be nice for me to know that everything is good in the big glade, too. I will feel you. And you must think of me, but only sometimes.'</p><p>"The blue sphere rose up, but not with ease, as usual. It rose from Anastasia in irregular bursts, vanishing in the space. But it left something invisible around her.</p><p>"Any time something negative happens, something Anastasia doesn't want, the surrounding dimension falls still, as if paralyzed.</p><p>"You lost consciousness when you tried to touch her against her will. She halts this phenomenon by raising her arms, whenever she can do so in time. As before, she still wants to do everything herself.</p><p>"We used to ask little Anastasia a question: 'What was that shining thing that dropped to the glade, what do you call it?' She thought for a short time and replied, 'You could call it Good, dear grandpas.'"</p><p>The old man fell silent, but I wanted to hear more about how little Anastasia lived in the forest, and I asked him, "What did she do afterward? How did she live?"</p><p>"She just lived," the old man replied. "She grew up, like everybody else. We suggested that she help the summer people. Since she was six, she could see people at a distance, to sense and help them. The summer people fascinated her. Now she believes that the summer people phenomenon is a smooth transition toward comprehending the essence of earthly being.</p><p>"She has been shining her ray diligently for twenty years. She has warmed the plants in their small gardens. She has healed people. She has tried to explain to people in a low-key way how they need to treat their plants, and it's all worked out wonderfully for her.</p><p>"Then she began observing other aspects of human life. It was fate that brought her together with you. It also created this idea: 'Carry people across the dark forces' span of time.'"</p><p>"Do you believe she can succeed?" I asked.</p><p>"Vladimir, Anastasia knows the power of Man-Creator's thought and would not allow herself to declare herself just like that. That means she has some kind of power. Now she will not veer from this path or retreat. She's persistent. That's from her father."</p><p>"That means she's taking action. She's trying to produce her own thought-images, and we here are merely discussing the spiritual. We're like children wiping our runny noses. Some people ask me, 'Does Anastasia exist or did I dream her up?'"</p><p>"People cannot ask such a thing. People immediately sense her when they come in contact with the book. She is in it, too. Only illusory people can ask those questions, not genuine ones.</p><p><div class=chapter id=0220>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>20. Illusory People</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p>"I'm talking about perfectly genuine people, like those two young women. See?" I pointed to two young women standing five or six meters from our bench.</p><p>The old man looked at them closely and said, "I think one of them, the one smoking, isn't genuine."</p><p>"What do you mean, not genuine? I'll go up to her right now and do some harm to her rear end, and you'll hear a plenty genuine howl or curse."</p><p>"Vladimir, what you see before you right now is merely an image, one created by the postulates of the technocratic world. Look closely. The young woman is wearing uncomfortable high-heeled shoes that pinch.</p><p>"She is wearing those shoes only because someone else dictates the kind of shoes she should now wear. She has on a skirt made of a material that resembles leather but isn't. It even harms the body, but she wears it, submitting to a dictate, creating the image it desires.</p><p>"Look, she is brightly made up and arrogant, outwardly independent, but only outwardly. Her whole appearance doesn't match the genuine her. The image dictated by other people's thoughts and shapes have jammed her genuine self. The illusion has no soul and blocks out the living Soul. Her soul remains captive to this image."</p><p>"You can say all you like about the Soul, captivity, and the dictate of some image. The truth of it is hard to sort out."</p><p>"I'm old now and I can't keep up with your thoughts. I can't speak convincingly, the way Anastasia can." The old man sighed and added, "Will you let me try to show you?"</p><p>"Show me what?"</p><p>"I'm going to try to destroy the illusory, nonliving image, just for a while. To free the young woman's soul. Observe closely."</p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p>The smoking young woman was haughtily telling her girlfriend something cruel. The old man observed them closely and intensely. When the young woman looked away from her girlfriend and fastened her gaze on a passerby, the old man's eyes followed her gaze.</p><p>Then he stood up, gestured to me to follow him, and headed for the young women. I followed him. The old man stopped half a meter from the young women and began to stare at the one smoking. She turned her head toward him, blew cigarette smoke in the old man's face, and said with some irritation, "What do you want, granddad? Doing some begging are you?"</p><p>The old man sustained a pause, probably gathering his wits from the smoke cloaking his face, and said in a tender and calm tone, "Take the cigarette in your right hand, daughter. You need to try to hold it with your right hand."</p><p>The young woman obediently switched the cigarette to her right hand. But that wasn't the main thing. Her face suddenly changed completely. The haughtiness vanished. Everything in the young woman changed: her face, her posture. She even spoke in a completely different tone of voice.</p><p>"I'll try, grandfather."</p><p>"You should have a child, daughter."</p><p>"It would be hard for me on my own."</p><p>"He will come to you. Go and think about your hand, think about your baby, and he will come. Go, daughter, you must hurry."</p><p>"I will." The young woman took a few steps, then stopped and, turning to her girlfriend, called to her in a calm voice unlike her previous irritated one.</p><p>"Come with me, Tanechka."</p><p>They left.</p><p>"That's really great! You could tame any woman that way," I said when we sat back down on the bench. "Terrific. Just like some kind of super-hypnosis. Mysticism!"</p><p>"It isn't hypnosis, Vladimir, and there's no mysticism to it whatsoever. This is simply paying close attention to the person. The person, not the artificial image that overshadows the genuine person. The real self responds immediately and gathers strength when people address it specifically and ignore the illusory image."</p><p>"But how were you able to see the invisible person behind the visible image?"</p><p>"It's all very simple, I assure you. I merely observed a little. The young woman was holding the cigarette in her left hand. She searched for something in her purse with her left hand, too. That means she's left-handed, and if a little child holds his spoon or does something else with his left hand, his parents try to explain to him that he must do it with his right.</p><p>"She was happy with her parents. I realized that when she let her eyes linger on the man and woman walking along holding a little girl by the hands. So I said something to her that her parents might have said when she was a child.</p><p>"I tried to say it in the same tone and voice her parents might have used, when she was little and direct and still not covered up by an imposed image. She—that little girl, the genuine person—responded immediately."</p><p>"But you talked about giving birth. What was that about?"</p><p>"She's pregnant. More than a month pregnant already. This child does not need an alien image. The little girl inside this young woman wants the child very much, so she and her illusory self are battling it out. Now the little girl will win!"</p><p><div class=chapter id=0221>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>21. Why Doesn't Anyone See God?</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p>"Anastasia told me when she and I were in the taiga together that no one sees God because his thoughts work with such great speed and density. It makes me wonder why He doesn't slow them down so that people can look at Him."</p><p>The old man lifted his stick and pointed to a bicyclist riding by.</p><p>"Look, Vladimir. The bicycle wheel is spinning. The wheel has spokes, but you don't see them. They're there, you know that, but the speed of revolution keeps you from seeing them.</p><p>"To put it another way, the speed of your thoughts and your visual perception won't let you see them. If the bicyclists were to go slower, you would see the wheel's spokes blurred.</p><p>"If he stopped, you would see them clearly, but the bicyclist himself would fall. He would not reach his goal, since he had stopped his movement, and all for the sake of what? So that you could see that they were there? But what does this give you? What does it change in you? Around you?</p><p>"You would know for sure they were there, and that's all. The bicyclist could get up and continue his movement. But others would also want to see, and for their sake he would have to fall over and over. To what end?"</p><p>"Well, to be able to look at him just once."</p><p>"What would you see? After all, the bicyclist lying on the ground would no longer be a bicyclist. You would have to use your imagination.</p><p>"When God changes his speed of thought, he is no longer God. Wouldn't it be better for you to learn to speed up your own thought? When you speak with someone who thinks very slowly, doesn't this irritate you? Isn't it tortuous to slow down your thinking to match his?"</p><p>"You're right. To adjust to a fool you have to become a fool yourself."</p><p>"It's the same for God. For us to see him, he needs to slow his own thinking to our level, to become like us. But when He does this and sends his sons, the crowd, gazing on them, says, 'You're not God or the son of God. You're a pretender. Either perform a miracle or you'll be crucified.'"</p><p>"But why shouldn't a son of God perform a miracle, if only to get the unbelievers to leave him alone and not crucify him?"</p><p>"Unbelievers aren't convinced by miracles. They are tempted. They burn the creators' miracles in bonfires, shouting, 'We burn the works of the forces of darkness!' Not only that, if you look around, God has created countless miracles. The Sun rises, and in the night we have the Moon. The bug in the grass is also miraculous, after all, and the tree . . .</p><p>"Here we are, you and I, sitting under a tree. Who could invent a mechanism more perfect than this tree? It's just a particle of His thought—and there are materialized particles of thought, alive, moving about underfoot, flying above us in the blue, singing for us, caressing our body with a ray of warmth. They are His, they are all around, they are for us.</p><p>"But how many are incapable not just of seeing but also of feeling and understanding? Not even perfectly, maybe only making use of it, but at any rate not distorting or destroying miraculous living creations.</p><p>"As for His Sons, they have but one lot: to raise man's consciousness through their words by slowing down their thought and daring to be incomprehensible."</p><p>"But here Anastasia said, 'Merely uttering words will not raise man's consciousness to a significant level.' I agree. Humanity has uttered many words, but what has come of it? There are more than enough unfortunate destinies around us, and we might see a disaster on Earth."</p><p>"That is quite correct. When words are not from the Soul, when the threads connecting them to the Soul are broken, words are empty, featureless, faceless. My granddaughter Anastasia has the ability to create images not only in each word but also in the sound of each letter.</p><p>"Earthly teachers, His sons, alive and incarnate today, will acquire such power that the human Spirit will beam over the darkness."</p><p>"What do sons and teachers have to do with this? Only she has these abilities, after all."</p><p>"She has already begun passing them all out. After all, even you were able to write a book. Readers showered poems on the world, and new songs have been heard. Have you heard them?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"So you see all this will be multiplied many times over in spiritual teachers if only they come in contact with the book. Where for you it may merely be words, they will feel living images, and the power will be multiplied in them."</p><p>"They'll feel it, but I don't? Am I completely insensitive? Why did she talk with me, then, and not them?"</p><p>"You are not capable of distorting what you've heard, and you have nothing you might add. Writing is set out more clearly on a blank sheet. But even your thought will speed up, too."</p><p>"All right, say it does, so I don't lag behind the others. Basically, everything you're saying seems correct. Here in Russia, we have one religious leader—followers call him their teacher. He told them, 'Read the book about Anastasia. It will stir you,' and many of them did buy the book."</p><p>"So, you see, he understood it, sensed it, and for that reason he could help Anastasia and you. Did you even thank him for his help?"</p><p>"I never met him."</p><p>"You can say thank you with your Soul."</p><p>"Silently, you mean? Who's going to hear that?"</p><p>"He will hear with his Soul."</p><p>
"There's one other nuance here, too. He spoke well about the book, and also about Anastasia, but he said I wasn't a real man. 'A real man did not meet with Anastasia,' he said. I heard this myself on television and then read it in the newspaper."</p><p>"And who do you think you are, perfection?"</p><p>"Well, maybe not quite perfection . . ."</p><p>
"Then there's no point taking offence. You should try to be a real man. My granddaughter will help you. Whoever Love is capable of lifting will rise to the heights. Not everyone is fated even to contemplate such a thing. The Creator requires incredible speed of thought."</p><p>"What speed does your thought operate at? It's not an ordeal to talk with me?"</p><p>"Everyone who leads a way of life like we do has a speed of thought that significantly exceeds that of people of the technocratic world. Our thought isn't slowed by constant concern over clothing, food, and much else.</p><p>"But it is not an ordeal for me to talk to you, because of my Love for my granddaughter. She wanted it so much, and I am happy to do at least something for her."</p><p>"Is Anastasia's speed of thought the same as yours and your father's?"</p><p>"Anastasia's is faster."</p><p>"How much faster? In what ratio? Say, how many minutes would it take you to think through what it takes her, say, ten minutes?"</p><p>"To think through what she produces in a second takes us several months. This is why she sometimes seems alogical to us, as well as why she is completely alone. But we can't help her substantially because we don't always immediately understand the point of her actions.</p><p>"My father has stopped talking altogether. He keeps trying to match her speed so that he can help her. He is trying to make me do the same. But I'm not even trying. Papa believes this is out of laziness. But I love my granddaughter very much and simply have faith that she is doing everything correctly. I'm happy to do anything she might ask of me, and so I've come to see you."</p><p>"Then how did Anastasia talk to me for three days?"</p><p>"We wondered, too, for a long time. After all, she might have gone out of her mind. Only recently did we understand. While talking with you, she did not stop her own thinking. On the contrary, she actually accelerated it—accelerated it and transformed it into images.</p><p>"Now, like your computer programs, they will be revealed to you and to those who read the book. They will be revealed and will speed up by leaps and bounds the movement of human thought, bringing them closer to God.</p><p>"When we understood this, we decided that by devising this, she had created a new Law in the Universe. Now it's clear, though, she was simply using a previously unknown capability of pure and sincere Love. Love has remained the Creator's mystery. Yet she has revealed yet another great capacity and power of that Love."</p><p>"Does her speed of thought allow her to see God?"</p><p>"Hardly. She does live in the flesh, after all. God is in the flesh, too, but only half of Him. His flesh is all the people on Earth. Anastasia, as a small particle of this flesh, sometimes grasps something. Occasionally achieving unthinkable speed of thought, she may sense it more than others do, but this happens for her for brief segments of time."</p><p>"And what does it give her?"</p><p>"In a single instant she perceives Truths, the essence of being, and a consciousness that wise men spend their whole lives trying to achieve, passing on and perfecting their teachings."</p><p>"You mean she shares the knowledge of the lamas of the East and the wisdom of the Buddha and Christ and knows yoga?"</p><p>"Yes. She knows more than has been said in the treatises that have come down to you. But she finds them lacking, since there is no harmony for all of us living on Earth today, and the movement toward disaster continues.</p><p>"Therefore, she constructs her inconceivable combinations. She says, 'Enough of teaching people precepts. Enough of tempting them with Adam and Eve's apple. We need to let them feel—yes, feel!—what Man sensed before, what He could and couldn't do.'"</p><p>"You mean to tell me that she really might be able to do good for all people? If that's so, then when will this good begin?"</p><p>"It already has—only small shoots, but that is only so far."</p><p>"Where are they? How can they be seen or felt?"</p><p>"Ask those who read the book. They are in them. After all, she has evoked light thoughts in many. That can no longer be denied. Many will tell you this. She did this with her signs. It's incredible, but it worked.</p><p>"And you yourself, Vladimir, think. What were you and what have you become? Vladimir, the model program is being revealed in you, and her Soul is being revealed in people. The world in you is beginning to change, as it changes the images around you.</p><p>"We cannot grasp it completely, as she can. What lies on the surface and is manifest, we can also sort out. What helps her bring about this reality remains a mystery.</p><p>"We could make an extra effort to solve it, of course, but I don't want to be distracted from the beautiful reality being born. The day's beautiful dawning must be admired.</p><p>"When you start trying to lay out why it is happening, you get, instead of enchantment, digging around, which leads to and changes nothing."</p><p>"My goodness! It's all so unusual and so complex. Still, I was hoping that Anastasia was just a hermit, only unusually good and beautiful and a little naïve."</p><p>"I'm telling you. There is no need to dig around and wrack your brains. If what I've said is too difficult, let her remain a beautiful and good hermit for you, since that is how she appeared to you.</p><p>"Others will see something else. You were given what you were given. Your consciousness is not ready to take in anything else, and this is fine. Try simply to admire the dawn, if you can. That is the most important of all."</p>


<p><div class=chapter id=0222>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>22. The Dawn in Russia</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>"The dawn will begin for everyone in Russia when each person lives better materially. The economy as a whole will improve, and each person will be better off.</p><p>"The entire material environment depends on Man's Spirit and consciousness."</p><p>"So be it. There's no sense to the sages' philosophies when you're hungry and naked."</p><p>"You need to make sense of why all this is happening. Each person does so for himself. Don't look for others to blame. Only changes in yourself will change everything around you, including your well-being. I agree with you. People are not going to be able to believe it all right away.</p><p>"But Anastasia did say, 'We have to do without admonitions. We simply have to show people,' and she has. Now what she has foreordained must be carried out.</p><p>"In three years, Siberia's settlements large and small—forgotten and abandoned settlements where nobody remains but old people whose children make no effort to visit—will become many times richer. Life will go into full swing, and many children will return. Furthermore, she is going to offer much more.</p><p>"She will reveal many secrets and restore the Primary Sources' knowledge and people's abilities. Russia will be the richest country. She will do this in order to prove that spirituality and knowledge of the Primary Sources are more important than technocracy's vain attempts. A new dawn will rise from Russia over the whole Earth."</p><p>"What do I have to do for this to happen?"</p><p>"Reveal the first secret my granddaughter disclosed to you. Tell in your book how healing oil needs to be obtained from the Cedar nut. Conceal nothing."</p><p>Everything inside me suddenly rebelled so, my breath caught in my throat. Unable to sit still, I jumped up.</p><p>"Why? Why should I suddenly do this? For everyone, for free. Any normal person will take me for an idiot.</p><p>"I organized an expedition and invested everything I had in it. Now my firm is ruined. Anastasia asked me to write a book, and I did. Now we're quits. Your aspirations and philosophy are hard for me to understand. I'm just setting them out since I promised Anastasia I would.</p><p>"Now about the oil, all that's clear to me. Now I know how much can be had for it. I'm not going to give the oil technology away to anyone. I'll put together a little money from the books and start producing it myself.</p><p>"I have to recover everything. Get back my ship and my firm. Buy a laptop so I can type the next book.</p><p>"I don't have a home now. I have nowhere to live. I want to buy a house trailer, and as I get rich, I want to erect a monument to Russian officers who are still alive but whose Souls have been mortally wounded.</p><p>"We have torn their soul asunder with our callousness at different times and people have defiled their honor and conscience. The very people for whom officers of all times have gone into battle.</p><p>"While you're there sitting peacefully in the forest, people here are dying. There are plenty of different 'spiritual people' around. All they talk about is spirituality, but they don't really want to do anything. Now I will at least do something. But to give it away just like that! To everyone! Not on your life!"</p><p>"Anastasia did set aside an income for you. I know: three percent from oil sales."</p><p>"What are those miserable three percent to me when you can get three hundred for the oil! I know world prices now. And what they sell is many times weaker in healing power. I've checked it out. They don't know the right way to extract it. Now I alone know. Everything she said has been confirmed.</p><p>"There are no analogs to it in the world for healing power, but only if everything is done correctly. Science confirms this as well. Pallas said it can restore youth. Now give it up, just like that!</p><p>"You've found yourself a patsy. I've dug through so much literature and sent people to the archives to confirm what she said. And they did. Lots of money went for that, too."</p><p>"You checked it all out, because you couldn't believe Anastasia right away. You wasted money and time due to your lack of faith."</p><p>"Yes, I did check it out. That's what had to be done. But now I'm not going to be a fool. 'Dawn for everyone'—well, 'dawn' is just great, but at dawn I'll still be a fool. I wrote the book. All the way she asked.</p><p>"I remember her repeating, 'Hide nothing—not the bad, not the good. Swallow your pride. Don't be afraid to be ridiculous and misunderstood.' I didn't hide anything, and what came of it?</p><p>"I come across like a complete idiot in it. People tell me that to my face—that I have no spirit, that there's so much I don't understand. I'm uncouth and coarse. A thirteen-year-old girl from Kolomna even wrote me a letter: You can't do that, she said.</p><p>"One woman came from Perm and said right on my doorstep, 'I want to look at what Anastasia found in him.' 'Hide nothing—not the good, not the bad. Swallow your pride. Don't be afraid to be ridiculous and misunderstood.' She did know everything!</p><p>"She came out well in the book. That's what people say. But what about me? And all because of her. If it weren't for the baby, I'd let her worry about these things. Just think! I wrote everything sincerely, as she requested, and people say to me, 'You're insensitive and a coward.'</p><p>"Of course, I'm a complete idiot, I did this to myself. I obeyed her. I wrote things about myself that I'll never live down to the end of my days, and when I die, everyone is going to have a good laugh.</p><p>"This book has turned out to have a life of its own. It will outlive me! Even if I myself stop printing it, what's the good of that? They're already putting out underground print runs. They're trying to photocopy it."</p><p>All of a sudden I stopped myself short after glancing at the old man. A teardrop was slowly rolling from his eye. I sat down beside him. He looked down in silence, and then he spoke.</p><p>"Understand, Vladimir, my granddaughter Anastasia can foresee a lot. She wanted nothing for herself. Neither fame nor income. She took on some of the fame, subjected herself to danger, but saved you. And the fact that you look the way you do in the book is her doing. That's for sure.</p><p>"But by this she didn't demean you. She saved you. By taking on herself the bulk of the dark forces all by herself. And you, in response to her—the pain of misunderstanding and irritation. Think about it. Is it easy for a woman who creates merely out of love to withstand that?"</p><p>"What kind of love is it that makes a fool of her beloved?"</p><p>"He who people call a fool is not a fool, but he who takes flattery for Truth, is. Think. How would you like people to regard you? Above everyone else? Very intelligent? All that could have been done in the first book, but then pride and ego would have destroyed you.</p><p>"Few even of the enlightened have been able to resist these sins. Pride creates an unnatural image of a person, and it overshadows the living Soul. This is why past philosophers and present-day geniuses can create so little.</p><p>"Having merely made the first stroke, in the grip of ego, they lose what was given them to begin with. But my granddaughter Anastasia had the good sense to shield herself from the flattery and admiration that breed pride. They can't get you now.</p><p>"She is saving you from many other misfortunes. She is protecting both your Spirit and your flesh. You will write nine sincere books. The land of the Dimension of Love will begin to shine! And then, when you have crossed the t's in the ninth book, you will be able to understand who you are."</p><p>"And what is that? You can't tell me now?"</p><p>"Who you are right now isn't hard to say. You are who you are right now. You are what you feel yourself to be. Anastasia may know who you will become. And she will wait, living each instant with Love. The fact that people sitting in their apartments tell you you're a coward—that's nothing. You must take it with humor.</p><p>"Advise them to go into the taiga for three days without gear. Sleep with a bear in a den. To make it complete, take along a lunatic. Isn't that exactly what Anastasia seemed to you to be at first?"</p><p>"Yes, more or less."</p><p>"Let the critic try to sleep with his own lunatic companion, in the forest depths, to the howling of wolves. Do you think he could?" the old man asked slyly.</p><p>Suddenly, when I saw the picture he'd drawn, I started laughing. The old man and I laughed together.</p><p>Then I asked him, "Can Anastasia hear what we said?"</p><p>"She'll find out about all your doings."</p><p>"Then tell her not to worry. I'll explain to everyone how to extract the healing oil from the Cedar."</p><p>"Fine, I'll tell her," the old man promised. "Do you remember everything you heard from Anastasia about the oil?"</p><p>"Yes, I think I do."</p><p>"Then repeat it."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0223>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>23. How to Extract Healing Oil from the Cedar Tree</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>Basically, it's not all that hard. We have modern technology, too. I'm not going to set it out. But there are some nuances that aren't quite the usual, and I will talk about them.</p><p>When you collect the cones, you must not strike the Cedar with mallets or logs, the way gatherers do today. This reduces the oil's healing power drastically. It is essential that you use only those cones the Cedar itself relinquishes.</p><p>They fall in the wind, and you can knock them down with your voice, as Anastasia does. They have to be picked up off the ground by people who are not unkind, and it's good when a child's hand picks up the cone. Generally speaking, all that follows needs to be done with good will and with light intentions.</p><p>"People like this can now be found in Siberian villages," Anastasia told me. What significance this has is hard to say. However, while the Bible also says that King Solomon sought people who knew how to chop down trees, it does not say how these people differed from ordinary people.</p><p>The nuts obtained after the cones are shelled have to be pressed for oil within three months. After that the quality deteriorates drastically. During the pressing, the kernels must not touch metal. The oil should not touch metal at all.</p><p>It can cure any disease; no diagnosis need be made. It can be used as a food, added to salads, or you can take a spoonful a day, preferably at sunrise, but even in the afternoon. In the light of day, not at night—that's the main thing.</p><p>"Have you thought that people might be offered fake oil?" I told the old man. But he replied with a certain cunning or cheerful humor.</p><p>"You and I are going to erect a barrier to fakes right now. And we'll earn your percentage."</p><p>"How will we do that?"</p><p>"You have to think, you're the entrepreneur."</p><p>"I used to be, but now it's not clear who I am."</p><p>"Let's think this through together. You correct me if anything's wrong."</p><p>"All right."</p><p>"The final product should be verified with instruments by those capable of verifying: doctors, scientists, specialists, and so on."</p><p>"Yes, that's right, they can issue a certificate."</p><p>"But the instruments might not catch everything. There also needs to be a tasting."</p><p>"Possibly. Tasters determine wine quality. Nothing can replace them. But wine tasters know very well how wines taste. They have their excellent sense of smell, for both aroma and taste. But who is going to verify the oil with a tasting?"</p><p>"You should."</p><p>"But how am I going to do that? I've only eaten ordinary oil. When we made it, we didn't follow the technology Anastasia said to. Not only that, I smoke."</p><p>"You shouldn't smoke or drink alcohol for three days before you're going to test the oil. Or eat meat or fats. Or talk to anyone for three days. Then you'll try it and be able to determine by its taste whether it's good or fake."</p><p>"What do I compare it to?"</p><p>"With this here." The old man took a wooden stick approximately two fingers thick out of his canvas bag. Another stick poked out of one end, acting as a stopper.</p><p>"This is genuine oil. Try it. You won't confuse the taste with anything else. But first let me try to drive out the smoking and other things that have built up in you."</p><p>"What do you mean 'drive out'? The way Anastasia did?"</p><p>"Yes, more or less."</p><p>"But she said that only the person who loves is capable of removing pains in the person loved with a Ray of Love. And warm his body so that his feet even perspire."</p><p>"With a Ray of Love. That's all correct."</p><p>"But you can't love me. The way she does."</p><p>"But I love my granddaughter. Let's try."</p><p>"Let's."</p><p>The old man squinted and began staring at me without blinking. Warmth flooded my body. Only it was much weaker than from Anastasia's gaze. It wasn't working for him. But he kept trying. So hard that his hands shook.</p><p>My body warmed up a little, but only a little. The old man still wouldn't give up, and I waited. All of a sudden my feet started to perspire, and there was a freshness in my head, and smells. . . . I could pick up the smells in the air.</p><p>"Oof! It worked," the old man said wearily, resting his elbows on the back of the bench. "Now give me your hand."</p><p>He opened the stick stopper and poured the Cedar oil onto my palm from the thicker stick. I licked it off—and a pleasant warmth began to run over my palate and in my mouth. And all of a sudden I smelled the scent of Cedar. It would be hard to confuse it with anything else.</p><p>"Will you remember now?" the old man asked.</p><p>"Yes. What's so hard about it? Once I ate a potato in a monastery. I remembered that for a long time. Twenty-seven years later I still remembered its taste. But how will people know that it's been verified? That it's genuine oil?</p><p>"And the price for it is too high. For a single gram of plain oil diluted with something they charge thirty thousand. I've seen it myself. In imported packaging. For that kind of money all kinds of people would freely go for fakes."</p><p>"Yes, money is running the show right now. We need to give this some thought."</p><p>"There, you see? A dead end!"</p><p>"Anastasia said that this money could be turned to good. Let's try to think along those lines."</p><p>"People have long given thought, for example, to how to ensure vodka from fakes. But . . . They change labels and stoppers, they come up with excise stamps, and nothing comes of it. They've always sold the surrogate and they always will. Today you can photocopy any stamp."</p><p>"Can you print money, too?"</p><p>"Money is a little harder."</p><p>"So let's do this. Let's glue money to the reverse of the bottle, like labels, so those wimpy pieces of paper work for the good."</p><p>"What do you mean, glue money? What nonsense is this?"</p><p>"Give me a bill, please. Some kind of money."</p><p>I gave him a thousand ruble note.</p><p>"There you are, it's all clear. You take the bills, tear them in half, glue one half to the box or something else. Hide the other. You can think of where. Or put it in your bank for safekeeping.</p><p>"The two halves, there, you see, have identical numbers, and anyone who wants to verify the oil's authenticity can check his number."</p><p>"Well, granddad," I thought. "You have a good head on your shoulders." And out loud I told him,</p><p>"There is no better protection against fakes. You're amazing!"</p><p>He burst out laughing and, through his laughter, said, "Then give me a percentage. A kickback!"</p><p>"A percentage? What percentage? How much do you want?"</p><p>"I want everything to be good," the suddenly sober old man said. Then he added, "Besides the three percent, take another one from the sale for yourself. On the packaged oil. And give it out for free to those you believe need to have it. Let it be a present to people from me and you."</p><p>"All right, I'll take it. You came up with some wonderful ideas. You're amazing."</p><p>"Wonderful? That means Anastasia will be happy for us. Otherwise my father always considers me lazy. But you think I’m amazing, is that right?"</p><p>"Yes, amazing!" And we laughed again. I added, "Tell Anastasia that you could have been an excellent entrepreneur."</p><p>"For sure?"</p><p>"For sure! You could have been a New Russian, and how!"</p><p>"Then I will tell Anastasia. I will also tell her about how you revealed everything about the oil to people. You won't regret revealing it to everyone?"</p><p>"What's there to regret? It's brought a whole lot of bother. I'll write the third book quickly, as I promised, and then I'll go back into business and trade, or something else normal."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0224>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>24. The Title!</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>(Dear reader, I don't know how to name this chapter.</p><p>Please, make your own title if you can)</p><p>I decided to tell Anastasia's grandfather about my new assistants, too.</p><p>"Right now a lot of articles are being written about Anastasia. Both scientists and religious associations are talking about her. They each interpret her a little differently. One creative collective, very spiritual and tactful people, suggested that I contract with them. They'd pay me to hand over the exclusive right to publicize and comment on Anastasia's statements in the media. I agreed."</p><p>"For how much did you agree to sell them Anastasia, Vladimir?"</p><p>The import of his question and its tone had a rather unpleasant effect on me.</p><p>I replied, "What do you mean, 'sell'? I told them more about Anastasia than was written in the book. I told spiritual people so that they could comment independently and explain her statements. They want to meet with her, too. They're even prepared to finance an expedition themselves. I agreed. What's bad about that?"</p><p>The old man was silent. Without waiting for the old man to speak, I added, "The fact that they offered me money for the exclusive rights—that's how it's done here. Services are rendered for payment. They will get more from their publications."</p><p>The old man was silent a little longer, his head bowed, and then, as if thinking aloud, he began to speak.</p><p>"You mean, you, being enterprising, sold Anastasia, and after deciding that only they were the most spiritual and competent in the world, they bought her."</p><p>"You put it so oddly. What did I do ultimately that was so bad?"</p><p>"Tell me, Vladimir, did it ever occur to you or those 'spiritual people' to ask, find out, or understand with whom Anastasia herself might want to speak and when? Do people visit you without your consent? After all, she has never invited any of them to visit."</p><p>"If she doesn't want to see them, she doesn't have to. She didn't sign the agreement."</p><p>"But you did! She is prepared to reveal what she knows to everyone, but she has the right to choose the means of communication herself. If she chose a book and your language, who has the right to dictate or demand anything else? She made her choice, but someone wants to change it, and for very clear ends.</p><p>"She won't talk to people who have set themselves above everyone else because she knows that their ego will distort the Truth sacred to her, turn it around, and suit it to themselves."</p><p>"Why paint it all in such a black light in advance? These people are interested in many teachings. They're very spiritual."</p><p>"They've decided that they are the most spiritual of all. Spiritual egoism crowns the most mortal sin: pride."</p><p>I was annoyed with myself but didn't understand why. I hadn't received the money for the agreement yet, so I could break it. But a little while later, once again, seeing nothing harmful in it, I signed an agreement with a spiritual center giving them exclusive rights to my own interviews.</p><p>Once again, their tact and spiritual knowledge had seduced me, especially since the agreement concerned only me and I had the right to dispose of myself. Nevertheless, once again both they and I had fallen into a trap, and once again it came out that I had indirectly sold Anastasia and they had bought her.</p><p>This time it wasn't Anastasia's grandfather but a Moscow reporter who read the agreement and said indignantly, "You fool. You're selling Anastasia cheap. Read the contract closely and give it careful thought.</p><p>"You've ceded to others the right, unilaterally, to interpret everything connected with Anastasia and use it on the most powerful information channel as they see fit. At the same time, you've given up your own chance to protest their opinion, no matter what it is."</p><p>It's difficult to determine the truth of this. Instead, I'll cite here a few provisions from this contract.</p><p> </p><p>1. Subject of the agreement:</p><p>1.1. The author transfers exclusive rights to the video filming of himself, as well as the use of other video materials connected directly or indirectly with the production of the "Anastasia" television video programs (henceforth, "the program"). Said transfer of rights to the Executor shall extend to all the countries of the world.</p><p>1.2 The Executor is obligated, using his own financial means, to produce three programs 30-40 minutes in length apiece, on professional BETACAM carriers, in the amount of 1 (one) apiece.</p><p>1.3 With the consent and understanding of the situation by the Author and Executor, any interaction with video or film studios, television, including cable television, as well as any video filming on any equipment, as well as the use of video materials on this topic, shall be carried out only and exclusively by the Executor.</p><p>The Author does not have the right, as long as the Agreement is in effect, to give video interviews or produce any video materials that utilize directly or indirectly the same concepts and terms as in the programs.</p><p> </p><p>In general, analyzing the events connected with the writing, publication, and distribution of Anastasia, I concluded that those who call themselves "strongly spiritual" have a flip side, which they themselves fear and which spurs them to constantly assert and allude to their spirituality. They are probably afraid people will see their flip side.</p><p>It's simpler with entrepreneurs. Their actions and aspirations are more open, less veiled, and consequently more honest, both to themselves and to those around them—society in general. I may be wrong, but you can't deny the following facts.</p><p>The Anastasia text was typed by three Moscow students. They had no hope of any speedy remuneration for their labor. They never talked about anything spiritual at all.</p><p>The director of Moscow Printing Press No. 11, retired officer G. V. Grutsya, published the book at his own expense. The print run was small and promised only losses. Grutsya, an entrepreneur, never spoke of anything spiritual, either.</p><p>The next print run was paid for by Nikitin, the director of a Moscow commercial firm, but later it became clear that he did not sell the books he printed. He gave me most of the print run to sell and set no due date for repayment. He didn't talk about anything spiritual either.</p><p>It was later that the "spiritual" people got in on the act and surreptitiously released a print run of forty thousand copies. When their "spiritual" behavior came to light, they talked about their spirituality and desire to create something light. They promised to pay royalties.</p><p>They're still promising to this day. This is not an isolated instance. In general, "spiritual" folk have a great disregard for payments, especially when they owe them.</p><p>As for the transfer of exclusive rights, I decided to declare on the pages of this book: "I will not transfer the exclusive right to the interpretation of Anastasia's statements to anyone ever again. If anyone declares his privilege, people should know that I did not give it voluntarily."</p><p>Why do I say "voluntarily"? Soon after, threats from anonymous sources came showering down on the Moscow journalist who helped me break the contract. Who are they? What do they want? That's "spiritual people" for you!</p><p>They've turned spirituality into a racket, but I know all about scams, and there are people involved, too. I want to tell them to be more cautious with those kinds of con artists. Think long and hard before making any decision. Sort out calmly where the "spiritual people" are herding you.</p><p>Furthermore, in the first book I wrote that I had suggested to Anastasia that she come and appear on television herself, but she refused. At the time, I couldn't understand her reasons. Now what she'd foreseen had become clear. Even after the book came out, many interpretations of her statements appeared. There were all kinds.</p><p>There were interesting ones and debatable ones, but apart from everything else, I began to see clearly the desire of individuals to interpret her in support of their own interests. There were even direct statements: "Do you think you're the only one who has the right to talk to her?" "You don't understand everything. Let others communicate with her and more good will come of it."</p><p>But she's not an object that can be transferred to someone. She's a Human Being! She herself has the right to decide how to act and with whom to speak and what about. It has become increasingly clear that a visible and invisible mass of dark forces has indeed assailed Anastasia in the form of fanatics and self-interest.</p><p>"I know that a mass of dark forces is going to come crashing down on me, but I am not afraid of them. I will manage to give birth to and raise our son so that he can see what I have dreamed of. And people will be carried across the dark forces' span of time," Anastasia said in the first book.</p><p>They raise their children to age eleven. That means she can hold on for at least ten more years.</p><p>"What about after that?" I asked her grandfather. "Will she inevitably die?"</p><p>"It's hard to say," the old man replied. "Everyone else has died significantly earlier, and she has gone down a path that has led to physical death more than once, but each time, at the last moment, a forgotten law powerful in its priority has blazed up, illuminating the essence of the Truth of earthly being and left her with life in her earthly body."</p><p>The old man fell silent and once again began meditatively scratching signs in the ground with his stick. I was thinking as well. "I had to go and get mixed up in this story! Of course, I can't abandon it all now. Maybe before, but now I can't because of the child. Anastasia has given birth to our son.</p><p>She should be dealing with the baby and raising him, but she still hasn't abandoned her dream of carrying people across the dark forces' span of time. And she won't, because she's so stubborn. A woman like that won't.</p><p>Who's to help this naïve woman? If I stop doing what I promised her, then no one will be left at all. She'll go to pieces—something nursing mothers shouldn't do. Let her first wean the child.</p><p>I asked the old man, "Is there anything I can do for Anastasia?"</p><p>"Try to understand what she says and wants. Then you'll have mutual understanding instead of casting about. A warm wave will warm your heart, and a new dawn will rise over the world."</p><p>"Could you be more specific?"</p><p>"It's hard for me to be more specific. Sincerity is important in a lot of things. So do what your heart and Soul tell you."</p><p>"She spoke of a little out-of-the-way Russian town. As if it could be richer than Jerusalem and Rome. Because of the many holy places of our ancestors in its vicinity.</p><p>"Apparently, they are more significant than the temples of Jerusalem, but the locals' lack of awareness keeps them from seeing it. I want to go there and change that."</p><p>"This can't be done quickly, Vladimir."</p><p>"Well, I didn't know it was impossible, and I promised Anastasia I would. Now I need to change it somehow."</p><p>"Since you don't know it's impossible, you will. Good luck! But it's time for me to go."</p><p>"I'll see you off."</p><p>"Don't waste your time. There's no need to see me off. Think about what you're doing."</p><p>The old man rose and held out his hand.</p><p>I watched Anastasia's grandfather retreating down the lane and thought about my upcoming trip to Gelendzhik, recalling what Anastasia had said about it. Here is how the conversation about it began.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0225>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>25. Your Holy Places, Russia!</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>I asked Anastasia, "Does one come across Ringing Cedars often?"</p><p>"Very, very rarely," she replied. "Maybe two or three times in a thousand years. Right now, besides this saved one there is one other, and it could be sawed down and used as intended."</p><p>"What does that mean, 'used as intended'?"</p><p>"The Universe's Great Intellect, God, who created man and everything around him, must have given people the opportunity to recover the abilities they'd lost and take advantage of the wisdom that has accumulated in the nonmaterial world.</p><p>"This wisdom has existed from the very beginning, but due to his sinfulness man lost the ability to perceive it.</p><p>"My grandfather and great-grandfather told you about the Ringing Cedar and its unusual healing properties, but they did not explain that its rhythms and pulsations are close to the Great Intellect. If these are combined, they can be multiplied by the rhythms that many people have in them.</p><p>"If such a person places his palm on the warm trunk of a Ringing Cedar and runs it down the trunk, stroking it, he will have the chance to communicate with the infinite volume of wisdom.</p><p>"He would then be capable of comprehending a great deal of the area he was thinking about at the moment of contact and would think about subsequently. This would happen in each person to varying degrees. I am telling you about the Supreme Manifestation."</p><p>"But why does it have different effects? You mean it chooses?"</p><p>"It acts identically. Its rhythm and vibration are invariable always. However, some people can tune into it and feel it in full, while others sense it only slightly.</p><p>"Many people will not feel anything at all right away. But comprehension will come gradually even to these. At least, the possibility of understanding will increase."</p><p>"I don't understand. What is it choosing?"</p><p>"Vladimir, I've told you. It's not about the tree, but the person. . . . There! I've found it, an example: music! You see, when music is heard . . . music is also vibration and rhythm. But some people listen to it closely and feelings arise in them, sometimes even tears of joy and tenderness. Others listen to the same music indifferently or don't want to listen at all.</p><p>"It's the same with the Cedar. Only those capable of sensing and understanding will hear a lot, which is revealed in them gradually, at those moments when the person wants to think seriously.</p><p>"Women may acquire the strength and wisdom of the Primary Sources, fulfill their purpose, and make their chosen man, themselves, and the child born in Love happy. Here, too, the miracle does not lie in the Cedar but in human aspirations. The Cedar merely helps them and is not foremost in the achievement of good."</p><p>"Incredible! This is like some beautiful legend."</p><p>"You don't believe it? You consider what I've said a legend? Then why did you try so hard to get to these parts and want so much for me to show you the Ringing Cedar?"</p><p>"Well, I don't consider all of it a legend. After your grandfather and great-grandfather's story about the Cedar I didn't believe it at first, either.</p><p>"Later, when I got home from the expedition, reading the popular scientific literature, I became acquainted with what scientists had to say with respect to its healing properties and was struck that both scientists and the Bible were of the same opinion.</p><p>"But nowhere is it even approximately stated about the possibility of sensing through the Cedar a connection with the Intellect or God, as you talk about it."</p><p>"You didn't read the scientists' statements or the Bible carefully, or else you did not attach significance to the main thing. Otherwise, you would not have doubted me."</p><p>"What could I have missed? The Bible for instance, only speaks of the Cedar in two places: when God teaches how to heal people with its help, and later, on how to decontaminate a dwelling."</p><p>"But the Bible also speaks of King Solomon as one of the wisest of rulers and most respected by his people. King Solomon is a historical figure, after all, not a legend."</p><p>"And so?"</p><p>"The Bible says that this king build a temple to God out of cedar and next to it a house for himself out of cedar as well. Furthermore, in order to obtain the cedar, he hired more than thirty-thousand workers, who brought it from another country.</p><p>"To fell the cedar trees, Solomon went to another king, Hiram, with a request to give him men 'that can skill to hew timber.' For this cedar, King Solomon gave twenty towns of his own kingdom.</p><p>"Just think. Why did this wisest of rulers need to go to such expense to build a temple and house out of a material less sturdy than what he had at hand?"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"You could have found the answer in the Bible, too: 'And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the Lord: So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord' (3 Kings 8).You can find indirect proof in the statements of your scientific luminaries, too."</p><p>"That's great. I guess I can believe it. You mean he reveals many secrets for people. Show me the Ringing Cedar that can be harvested. I will bring it to some town where it will be easier for the people from all over the world who want to touch it."</p><p>"Where today will you find a town like that, where the inhabitants will not defile this sacred object, will ensure its protection, and will create the proper conditions for people to approach it?</p><p>"I'll try to find it. Why did you decide that this would be hard to do?"</p><p>"The consciousness of people today is too constrained by the programs of the technocratic world. They're starting to resemble biorobots."</p><p>"What biorobots?"</p><p>"The technocratic world is set up in such a way that man invents all kinds of mechanisms and social postulates allegedly to make his life easier. In fact, the easing is illusory.</p><p>"Man himself is becoming the robot of the technocratic world. He is constantly short of time to think about the essence of being, to listen to others, or to give serious thought to his own fate.</p><p>"He's like a programmed robot. Here you see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears, but it's hard for you to believe."</p><p>"Anastasia, my situation is different. I can't call myself a strong believer. Basically, I believe, but probably not the way others do. Right now, we have a lot of genuine believers.</p><p>"Many read the Bible. They will catch on immediately when they see how much the Bible says about the Cedar. They'll believe and treat your piece of Cedar carefully."</p><p>"Faith comes in different forms, Vladimir. Often a man holds a Quran, Bible, or other book of the Sources' wisdom, and says he believes. He even tries to teach others, but in fact he is simply haggling with God: 'See, I believe in you. Give me credit for that, just in case.'"</p><p>"What is it then, faith? How should it be expressed?"</p><p>"In one's way of life, world-views, and understanding of one's own essence and purpose, and in one's corresponding actions and attitude toward one's environment—in one's intentions."</p><p>"You mean simply believing isn't enough?"</p><p>"Simply believing isn't enough. Imagine an army. All the soldiers, down to the very last man, believe in their commander, but they don't go into battle. They believe in him so strongly that they think he will conquer by himself. So the soldiers sit there and watch their commander meet the enemy's host alone. They shout to him, 'Go on! Go on! We believe in you strongly!'"</p><p>"Not bad, the example you've drawn. That particular absurdity doesn't happen."</p><p>"This absurdity goes on in real life."</p><p>"Then cite an example from our concrete, real life, not something made up."</p><p>"Fine. There is a town in Russia. It is called Gelendzhik. It is a place for people to relax from the daily bustle, meditate, and come into contact with sacred objects.</p><p>"There are many different holy places in the town itself and its environs. The significance of these holy places is greater than those in Jerusalem, greater than the pyramids of Egypt.</p><p>"This town could be one of the richest cities in the world—richer than Jerusalem and Rome—but the town is dying. It is a resort town. Its buildings and different hotels are vacant and falling down. The local authorities' materialistic consciousness keeps them from seeing the valuables that could make this city flourish.</p><p>"Promoting their town, they talk about the sea, artificial treatments, and how their hotel rooms have cupboards and refrigerators. They don't even mention the holy places. They themselves know or want to know little about them. They have other priorities.</p><p>"This town has many who call themselves believers. They are of many different confessions. Some of them actively teach others their faith. What faith?</p><p>"They have violated their environment and are even violating the Commandments of the books they respect. For instance, the Bible says, 'Love thy neighbor.'</p><p>"But before you can love your neighbor, you have to know something about him. You cannot love what you do not know. They consider themselves believers, but they do not know about their neighbors or their parents, who lived on holy ground and bequeathed to them an inexhaustible treasure—Holy Places.</p><p>"They carried down through the millennia bursts of wisdom and the light of their own Soul. Many call themselves believers, but they do not notice what is holy all around them—the sacred objects bequeathed by their ancestors to help them."</p><p>"What are the sacred objects in this town?"</p><p>"You see, Vladimir, next to Gelendzhik grows the Cedar of Lebanon mentioned so many times in the Bible. This living, direct creation of God, about which so much was said even before Jesus Christ appeared on Earth, grows next to this town. It's only a hundred years old.</p><p>"It's still an adolescent but it's already very beautiful and strong. It grew there because it was planted by a worthy man, a writer named Korolenko.</p><p>"Because he was revered for a while, they built a fence around the Cedar. But now the house where this man lived is falling down and people ignore the tree."</p><p>"Do the believers?"</p><p>"Many people in this town who consider themselves believers pay no attention to this Cedar or to the other great sacred objects of their ancestors. They are destroying them, and the town is dying."</p><p>"You mean, God is wreaking vengeance, punishing them?"</p><p>"God is good. He never wreaks vengeance, but what can He do when his creations are ignored?"</p><p>"Incredible! Such a tree really exists? That needs checking out."</p><p>"It does exist. There are many other sacred objects in the town's environs, but the people regard them from the standpoint of the technocratic world-view, the same way people regard the pyramids of the Wise Pharaohs."</p><p>"What? How do you know about the existence of Egypt's pyramids?"</p><p>"Thanks to the generations of my ancestors, I have preserved in myself the ability to communicate with the dimension where thoughts and wisdom reside. Communicating with them makes it possible to learn about everything you think of interest."</p><p>"Wait! Wait a minute. Let me verify this. You mean to tell me you know the secrets of the Egyptian pyramids?"</p><p>"Yes. Just as I know that the researchers of these pyramids have consistently focused on the material. They have been interested mainly in how they were constructed, their size, the ratio of their sides, and what was hidden inside, what objects were there.</p><p>"They have considered those who lived during the age of the pyramids' construction to be superstitious. They have appreciated the pyramids merely as a means for preserving valuables, the pharaoh's possessions, his body, his fame. That is why they have gotten away from the main, intelligent thing."</p><p>"I don't understand you, Anastasia. What intelligent thing have they gotten away from?"</p><p>Anastasia was silent for a while, as if gazing into infinity, and began her astonishing tale.</p><p>"You see, Vladimir, in remote antiquity, people living on Earth possessed abilities that allowed them to be much smarter than people today. The people of the Primary Sources could simply use all the information in the database that fills the Universe.</p><p>"This information of the Universe was created by the Great Intellect, God. Enriched by Him and people themselves and their thoughts, that information is so grandiose that it can answer any question. It works unobtrusively. The answer to the question man asked arose instantly in his subconscious."</p><p>"Well, and what did this give them?"</p><p>"Those people did not need a spaceship to fly to other planets. If they wished, they could see what was going on there anyway.</p><p>"Those people did not need a television or a telephone entangling the earth with communications lines, or writing, for the information you obtain from books, they could retrieve instantly through other means.</p><p>"Those people did not need a pharmaceutical industry; when necessary, they could obtain all the best medicines with a wave of the hand, because such cures exist in nature.</p><p>"Those people did not need today's means for getting around. They did not need cars and complexes producing food because everything was given them as it was.</p><p>"They realized that climate changes on one part of the Earth were a signal to resettle in another, so that the former Earth could rest. They understood the Cosmos and their planet.</p><p>"They were thinkers and understood their purpose. They perfected planet Earth. They had no equals in the Universe. In intellect, only the Great Intellect of the Universe himself—God—was higher.</p><p>"Approximately ten thousand years ago, among the human civilization that had settled in what is now Europe, Asia, the northern part of Africa, and the Caucasus, individuals began to appear in whom the connection with the Intellect of the Universe was partially or entirely blunted.</p><p>"From that moment humanity's drift toward planetary disaster began—whatever the disaster, be it ecological, nuclear, or bacteriological, as the scientists predict and the ancient religions say, describing them allegorically."</p><p>"Wait, Anastasia. I don't quite understand how you link the appearance of these disabled people with planetary disaster."</p><p>"You chose the modern word 'disabled' for them very correctly. Yes, they were disabled, defective people. What does a man who lacks vision require?"</p><p>"Someone to guide him."</p><p>"Who lacks hearing?"</p><p>"A hearing aid."</p><p>"Lacking arms or legs?"</p><p>"Prostheses."</p><p>"But they were missing something significantly greater, the connection to the Intellect of the Universe, and consequently that knowledge which could be used to help perfect and run the Earth. Imagine the crew of a super-modern spaceship that suddenly loses ninety percent of its intelligence.</p><p>"Not understanding anything, they begin to pull down the paneling to start a fire in their cabin. They pull instruments off the console and make decorations and toys out of them. The spiritually disabled can be likened to a dimwitted crew just like this.</p><p>"Just like them, these—as you put it—defective, disabled people first invented the stone ax and spear, and eventually went as far as the tip of a nuclear warhead. To this day, their thought continues with unbelievable persistence to smash perfect creations and to replace them with their own primitive creations.</p><p>"Their generations began to invent more and more, while stressing the Earth's natural mechanism with all kinds of artificial social arrangements. Then people began to fight with each other.</p><p>"These mechanisms and machines could not exist on their own, as natural things can. Not only could they not reproduce themselves, but they could not even restore themselves if they were damaged, like a tree can, for example.</p><p>"The technocrats needed many people to service these mechanisms and so turned some of the people, basically, into biorobots. Since they lack the individual capability of knowing the Truth, these biorobots are very easy to control.</p><p>"For example, with the help of artificial information technologies, you can install a program in them: 'We need to build communism.' Then you can create symbols, signs, and flags of a certain color for them. Later, using the same technologies, you can install in different people a different program—'Communism is bad'—and use other symbols and colors.</p><p>"These two groups with different programs will hate each other to the point of physical annihilation. All this started ten thousand years ago, when people, deprived of their connection to the Intellect, became increasingly numerous.</p><p>"Really, you could call them lunatics, too, because no living creature despoils the Earth the way they do. In those distant times, few remained who could still make free use of the Universal wisdom.</p><p>"They hoped that when humanity reached the point that the tainted air became hard to breathe, the polluted water dangerous to drink, and the artificial technical and social systems of life support they had created unwieldy and broken down due to increasingly frequent accidents, people would think hard.</p><p>"People standing at the brink of the abyss would think hard about the essence of being and their life's meaning and purpose. Then many of them would want to attain the Truth of the Primary Sources, which is only possible if the abilities of the Primary Sources are recovered.</p><p>"Few people living ten thousand years ago still had these abilities. Primarily, these were those at the head of the communities, the tribal leaders. They—or rather, others following their instructions—began to build special facilities out of heavy stone slabs.</p><p>"Inside, a chamber was created, a room about one and half by two meters and about two meters high, sometimes more, sometimes less. The slabs were placed at a slight angle inside. Sometimes these chambers were cut out of a monolithic stone, sometimes they were hidden underground with barrows over the top.</p><p>"In one of the chamber walls, in the slab, they made a conical opening about thirty centimeters in diameter. Ideally, they capped it with a fitted stone stopper.</p><p>"People who had not lost the ability to use the wisdom of the Universe went into them, these burial chambers. Those who were still alive and those who were born even thousands of years later could go to them and get an answer to whatever question concerned them.</p><p>"For this, they had to sit by the chamber and meditate. Sometimes the answer came right away, sometimes later, but it always came, because these facilities and those who had gone into them for eternity served as an information receiver. It was easy to connect through them to the Intellect of the Universe.</p><p>"These stone facilities are the prototype of the Egyptian pyramids. The pyramids are weaker receivers even though much bigger, but their essence, their purpose, is the same.</p><p>"The pharaohs buried in Egypt's pyramids were also thinkers, and they had partially retained the capability of the Primary Sources.</p><p>"But in order to get an answer to a given question with the pyramids' help, people had to come to the pyramid, not one by one, but in large numbers all at once.</p><p>"They stood along each of the four sides and aimed the gaze of their eyes and the gaze of their thoughts toward the pyramid's top, as if sliding up its slanted sides. At the peak, peoples' gazes and thoughts focused on a single point, thereby shaping a channel through which contact was made with the Intellect of the Universe.</p><p>"Today, the same can be done and the desired results achieved. At the focal point of the mental gazes, energy similar to radiation is formed. If you put a device at the top of the pyramid, at the focal point, it will register the presence of this energy. Unusual sensations will appear among the people standing below as well.</p><p>"Were it not for the sinful pride of modern men, the false but commonly held notion that the civilizations of the past were more foolish, people today could figure out the pyramids' true purpose.</p><p>"Modern researchers have paid more attention to the means of their construction and never have been able to determine how it was done. Yet, it's all simple. During construction they always used, along with physical strength and various contrivances, thought energy, which reduces gravity.</p><p>"Entire groups of people possessing these abilities helped the pyramids' builders. There are people still among us today who can move small objects with their minds.</p><p>"Immeasurably more significant than the pyramids for their effectiveness in establishing contact with the Universe's Intellect are the smaller stone facilities that predate the pyramids."</p><p>"Why, Anastasia? Because of their construction? Their shape?"</p><p>"Because living people went to die in them, Vladimir, and their death was unusual. They went into eternal meditation."</p><p>"What do you mean, 'living people'? Why?</p><p>"In order to create the possibility of restoring the power of the Primary Sources for their descendants. An elderly person, as a rule, one of the most wisdom-filled leaders or fathers, sensing his imminent demise, would ask his relatives and the people close to him to place him in this stone chamber. If they considered him worthy, they did.</p><p>"They moved the heavy, massive slab roof aside. He entered the stone chamber, and they closed the roof over him. The person found himself totally isolated from the outside, material world. His eyes saw nothing, and his ears heard nothing.</p><p>"This complete isolation, this impossibility of letting even his thoughts return, but also not yet crossing over into another world, the shutting down of the usual sense organs, vision and hearing, created the possibility of total communication with the Reason of the Cosmos, of making sense of many worldly phenomena and actions.</p><p>"Most of all, the possibility lay open of subsequently passing on what has been understood to those who remained among the living and the generations to follow. Today, you call approximately the same state meditation, but that is child's play compared to meditation into eternity.</p><p>"Subsequently people would come to this stone chamber, pull off the cap closing the opening, and think and consult with the thoughts hovering in the chamber. The Spirit of Wisdom was always there."</p><p>"But Anastasia, how can you prove to people today the existence of these facilities and that people went inside them into eternal meditation?"</p><p>"I can! That is why I am telling you."</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"Very simply. After all, these stone chambers still exist today. Today you call them dolmens. You can see and touch them and verify everything I'm saying."</p><p>"What? Where? Can you show me such a place?"</p><p>"Yes. In Russia, for example, in the Caucasus Mountains, not far from the towns now called Gelendzhik, Tupase, Novorossiisk, and Sochi."</p><p>"I'll verify that. I'll make a special trip to see them. I just don't see how this could be. I'll verify that."</p><p>"Verify it, of course. Local inhabitants know about them but ascribe no significance to them. Many dolmen have already been looted. People do not understand their true purpose. They do not know they can use them to contact the wisdom of the Universe.</p><p>"Those who went into eternal meditation can never be embodied in anything material. They sacrificed eternity for the sake of their descendants, and their knowledge and possibilities went unclaimed. Here lies their greatest grief and sorrow.</p><p>"But serving as proof that people long ago went there to die is the placement of the skeletal bones discovered in the dolmens. Some died lying down, some sitting in the corner or reclining, leaning against a stone slab.</p><p>"People today have established this fact, and it has been described by your scientists, but again, they have not thought it significant. They are not doing serious research on the dolmens, which are being dismantled by local residents, who use the stone slabs for construction."</p><p>Anastasia lowered her head sadly and fell silent. I promised her, "I'll explain it. I'll explain everything to them. They won't loot or smash them. They won't scoff at them. After all, they just didn't know."</p><p>"Do you think you'll be able to explain?"</p><p>"I'll try. I'll go to those parts and try to explain. I don't know how yet. I'll find these dolmens, bow to them, and explain everything to people."</p><p>"That would be good. Then, if you do go to those parts, please bow to the dolmen in which my foremother died."</p><p>"Incredible! How can you know that your foremother lived in those parts and how she died?"</p><p>Anastasia replied, "How can you not know how your ancestors lived and what they did, Vladimir? What they wanted and strove for? My foremother deserves to be remembered. All my mothers knew her wisdom, and that wisdom helps me today.</p><p>"My foremother was the woman who knew perfectly how, when nursing a baby, to give it the ability to use the Intellect of the Universe. Back then, people in the civilization she lived in had stopped thinking it significant, just like today's people.</p><p>"When nursing a baby you mustn't get distracted by anything extraneous. You need to think only about the baby. She knew what to think about and how, and she wanted to pass her knowledge on to all people.</p><p>"My foremother wasn't that old, but she began asking the leader to put her in a dolmen, because this leader was old and the new one would never have carried out her request. Women were let into the dolmens only rarely.</p><p>"The old leader respected my foremother and valued her knowledge, and he gave her permission, but he couldn't force the men to move the dolmen's heavy slab aside and then close it over my foremother. Consequently, the women, and only the women, did this work.</p><p>"But no one has gone to my foremother's dolmen in a long time. They aren't interested in the knowledge she so wanted to pass on to everyone. She wanted children to be happy and make their parents happy."</p><p>"Anastasia, if you want, I'll go to this dolmen and ask her how infants should be nursed—what should be thought about and how. Will you tell me where it is?"</p><p>"Fine, I'll tell you, but you won't be able to understand her. You're not a nursing mother. You don't know what a mother nursing her infant feels. Only women, nursing mothers, can understand her.</p><p>"Just go up to this dolmen and touch it. Think something good about my foremother. She will like that very much."</p><p>We were silent for a while. Stunned by the precise directions to the dolmens, which could be verified subsequently, I did not express my doubts about their existence.</p><p>However, I did ask her to show me proof of the possibility of contacting the wisdom of the Universe, which was invisible and incomprehensible to me.</p><p>To which Anastasia replied, "Vladimir, if you constantly doubt everything I say, then even my proofs will remain incomprehensible and unconvincing, and we will have to spend a lot of time on them."</p><p>"Don't be angry, Anastasia, but your unusual reclusive way of life . . ."</p><p>"How can it be reclusive if I have the opportunity to be in contact not only with everything on Earth, but significantly more as well? On Earth there are so many people who are surrounded by their like and who are utterly lonely, cutoff recluses. It's not so bad when a person is alone. It is much worse when he is alone among people."</p><p>"All the same, if the dimension where, as you put it, the thoughts produced by human civilizations reside, had also been spoken of by one of our scientific luminaries, then people would believe them more than they do you. That's how modern man is. For him, science is the authority."</p><p>"There are people like this. I have seen their thoughts. I can't name their names. But these are probably major scientists by your standards. They have the opportunity to think a lot. You should go look for proof, and when you return, compare it with everything I've said."</p><p class=section>* * *</p><p>When I arrived in the Caucasus, I found the dolmens in the mountains not far from Gelendzhik. I photographed them on color film. The workers in the local history museum knew about the dolmens as well, but they didn't attach much significance to them.</p><p>I also found the dolmen in which Anastasia's foremother was buried. I bowed to it and put flowers on the moss-covered stone portal.</p><p>I looked at the dolmens—visible and tangible confirmation of what Anastasia had said. By that time, I had reread the Bible and 3 Kings, about King Solomon and his attitude toward the Cedar.</p><p>No scientist myself, I had no plans to sift through the many scientific works to confirm what Anastasia had said.</p><p>But incredibly, this young hermit from the deep Siberian taiga had confirmed it remotely, but in the language of modern science. People themselves brought and sent me scientific works that spoke about the existence of the Intellect of the Universe.</p><p>In the beginning, I quoted statements by Professor V. Kaznacheyev, a member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and director of the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, and Professor A. Akimov of the Russian Academy of Natural Science's International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics, published in Miracles and Adventures in May 1996.</p><p class=section>* * *</p><p>
I wrote this chapter about the holy places of Gelendzhik. A worker at the Druzhba sanatorium typed it up on the computer, and the manuscript was read by sanatorium employees even before publications. And you know what happened. . . .</p><p>On 26 November 1996, at ten-thirty Moscow time, an event occurred that outwardly seemed anything but sensational or unusual. Nonetheless, I am convinced that it was an event of planetary importance.</p><p>A group of women was walking toward a dolmen located in the mountains not far from the village of Pshada in the Gelendzhik District. These were workers from the Druzhba sanatorium: V. T. Larionova, N. M. Gribanova, L. S. Zvegintseva, T. N. Zaitseva, T. N. Kurovskaya, A. G. Tarasova, L. N. Romanova, and M. D. Slabkina.</p><p>Unlike tourists, who occasionally visit these places to admire the beauties of nature and gaze idly upon the solitary dolmen in the mountains, these people, perhaps for the first time in a thousand years, were walking toward the dolmen in order to honor the memory of their distant ancestor.</p><p>They wished to honor the memory of a person who lived more than ten thousand years before, a wise leader of their clan. He had voluntarily had himself immured alive in the stone vault, so that he could convey the wisdom of the Universe down through the millennia to his descendants.</p><p>It's hard to say how many millennia his efforts went begging. Traces of our century's vandals were imprinted on the ancient slabs in the form of graffiti, and the dolmen's portal was wrenched open.</p><p>The people who came to the dolmen, at least in the last century, had no thought of the man buried here, his wisdom, and his wish and desire to give himself for the sake of the living. Attesting eloquently to this, unfortunately, are the prerevolutionary as well as more recent monographs I became acquainted with.</p><p>Scientists, researchers, and archeologists were more interested in the dimensions of the dolmen itself. Amazed, they tried to determine how slabs weighing many tons had been fashioned and erected.</p><p>Here, looking at the women standing by the dolmen and at the flowers they had brought and laid at the portal, I thought, "How many centuries or millennia has it been since you were given flowers, our wise ancestor? What is your Soul feeling right now? What might be happening in this instant in the astral world?</p><p>"Do you, our distant forefathers who are yet so close, view these flowers as the first sign that your efforts have not been in vain? And that your modern descendants—some of them, at any rate —aspire to a more conscious existence?</p><p>"These are only the first flowers. There will probably be more and more. But these are the first, the most eagerly awaited, and you will help those living now to attain the wisdom of the Universe, the comprehension of being. You are our distant forefathers."</p><p>Taking part in this trip to the dolmen was E. I. Pokrovsky, the medical doctor for the Gelendzhik Sanitary and Epidemiological Service (SES). He had been invited by tour guide and local historian V. T. Larionova for the purpose of measuring the dolmen's background radiation.</p><p>She told me that once, during an excursion to the dolmen, one of the tourists had a Geiger counter with him and the instrument was set off, showing a high level of radiation.</p><p>This tourist then called V. T. Larionova aside, so as not to alarm the other tourists, showed her the instrument, and informed her of the presence of radiation near the dolmen.</p><p>The local SES worker had a fairly precise instrument in a special case. He started producing readings of the earth's background radiation before the approach to the dolmen and continued doing this as we got closer, and finally at the dolmen itself, and even inside it.</p><p>While the group of women was listening to V. T. Larionova, I became increasingly agitated at the thought that right now this SES worker making the measurement recordings would announce them for all to hear, and this would be not a tourist's remark but an official conclusion. People might stop coming to the dolmen altogether when they learned about its elevated radiation.</p><p>Anastasia told me that this energy, similar to radiation, can appear and disappear. It is manageable and has a beneficial effect on man.</p><p>But what do the statements of an admittedly not very ordinary woman mean to us, modern people, compared to the assertion of modern science and the cut-and-dried reading by a modern instrument, especially regarding radiation, which modern man so fears?</p><p>Oh my God, I thought. Poor Anastasia! She so wanted people to treat these ancient, unusual burial sites of our forefathers differently, with care.</p><p>Now, after the announcement of an official conclusion, at best, no one would come near them, and at worst, they might be destroyed altogether. They wouldn't even be used for construction, as before.</p><p>But if there really is this Intellect of the Universe, if Anastasia really does have no trouble making use of it, then let Them come up with something.</p><p>E. I. Pokrovsky walked up to the group of Druzhba workers standing by the dolmen and read out the instrument's findings. They were incredible. Astonishment, then joy, gripped me.</p><p>According to the readings, the background radiation of the earth and environment, at least as we got closer to the dolmen, had actually decreased.</p><p>This was incredible as well because the group of people, while approaching the dolmen, had gone through areas with higher background. Their clothing and they themselves standing by the dolmen should have carried along the radiation on their clothing and shoes.</p><p>Despite this, the device had shown a reduction in background radiation. It was as if some invisible someone had said, "Don't be afraid of us, people. We are your distant parents. We wish you good. Take our knowledge, children!"</p><p>Suddenly I realized: Anastasia! It was thanks to her, after all, that this event had occurred. It was she, thousands of kilometers from this dolmen, who had drawn an invisible line through the millennia, uniting those living today with the most ancient civilization. She had made a breakthrough in the awareness of the aspiration for good.</p><p>Perhaps this has affected only a small number of people for now, but this is just the beginning. And it is absolutely real. For before me is a real dolmen, and the women and the flowers they brought are real and tangible.</p><p>The scientific literature says that dolmens are encountered near Tuapse, Sochi, and Novorossiisk, and in England, Turkey, North Africa, and India.</p><p>This confirms the existence of a very ancient civilization with a unified culture and the possibility of its branches communicating with each other, despite great distances. Undoubtedly, as Anastasia's information spreads to other dolmens as well, if they have been preserved, the attitude toward them will change.</p><p>The reaction of the people of Gelendzhik serves as proof of this. However, the first excursion that redisovered the astonishing information about the dolmens was conducted in Gelendzhik by "the luckiest and happiest woman," as Valentina Terentieva Larionova—a tour guide and local historian with thirty years' experience, as well as a deputy of the local council—described herself.</p><p>But this was still not all. A group of local Gelendzhik historians led by Larionova, after comparing the known facts, talking with old-timers, and studying the lives of the saints, confirmed the existence in the environs of Gelendzhik of the sacred objects Anastasia had spoken about.</p><p>Most of Russia's unique sacred objects go unmentioned in even a single information booklet. These are the Cedar of Lebanon, the Mount of Saint Nina, a hermitage, and the healing spring called the Holy Hand. There, people who have been cured tie cloths to the tree.</p><p>In the Gelendzhik area, a church is now being restored. A town church of Troitse-Sergiev Monastery is being built. I looked at all this and thought, "In just one small place in Russia, so many holy objects. A healing spring.</p><p>"Russians travel over the hills and far away to worship foreign Gods. How many other forgotten sacred objects are there in your lands, Russia, and who will discover them?"</p><p>I have done what I could. This is a miserable amount, of course, but I now have hope that Anastasia will show me my son.</p><p>I bought rompers, toys, and baby food and headed to the Siberian taiga to see Anastasia again and my son.</p><p class=tbc>To be continued...</p>

 </p><p><div class=chapter id=0301>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>1. Another Pilgrim</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>Here it is! The Ob, the great Siberian river, is before me once again. I have made my way to this northern village, where regular transportation ends, and now stand on the banks of the Ob. To get to where I can proceed on foot across the taiga to Anastasia's glade, I have to hire a boat or launch. Near one of the many boats hauled onto the shore, three men were disassembling their fishing tackle. I greeted them and said I was prepared to pay well for someone to take me to a certain place.</p><p>"It's Egorich who does that here. Takes half a million for the trip," one of the muzhiks replied.</p><p>I was immediately put on my guard by the information that someone here specifically transported people to a small Siberian village forgotten in the middle of the taiga. It was just twenty-five kilometers from there to Anastasia's glade. Also he charged a very high price, which meant there were takers. Demand determines supply. However, there's no haggling in the North.</p><p>So I asked, "How can I find this Egorich?"</p><p>"Somewhere in the village. Probably by the store. Over there, those kids horsing around by his launch, Egorich's grandson Vasyatka is with them. He'll check. Go ask him."</p><p>I'd barely said hello when Vasyatka, a sharp kid of about twelve, suddenly fired off this patter:</p><p>"You need to go? To see Anastasia? I'm on it! Just a sec and I'll get my granddad!"</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, Vasyatka skipped off to the settlement. It was obvious to me that he didn't need an answer. Evidently all the strangers in these parts had the same goal, in Vasyatka's opinion.</p><p>I made myself comfortable on the riverbank and began to wait. Having nothing to do, I looked at the water and thought.</p><p>From bank to bank here, it was probably a kilometer wide. In the middle of the taiga, a land unseen even from an airplane, water has been flowing gradually through the ages. What has it taken from the past without leaving a trace? What does the Ob water still remember? Maybe it remembers how Ermak, the conqueror of Siberia, pinned to the banks of the Ob by his foes, deflected their attack alone, sword in hand, but his blood seeped into the water from his mortal wound, and then the water carried his weakened body off somewhere. What had Ermak conquered? Might his actions have been something like modern-day racketeering? Today only the river could compare, probably.</p><p>Might the forays by Chingiz Khan's host have been more significant for the river? In antiquity, his horde was considered great. In Novosibirsk Province there is a district center called Ordinskoye—from orda, Russian for "horde"—where there is a settlement called Chingiz. Might the water recall how Chingiz Khan's horde retreated with their stolen loot, how they tied up a young Siberian girl and the mighty vizier implored her with passionate speeches and besotted eyes to go with him without resistance, of her own free will? The girl said nothing and lowered her eyes. All the vizier's soldiers had already fled, but he kept talking to her, kept begging for her love. Then the vizier threw her and a sack of gold across the croup of his steed, leapt into the saddle, and made a dash for the bank of the Ob on his faithful horse, saving himself from pursuit. His pursuers caught up. The vizier threw them gold, and when his sack was empty the vizier began ripping off his precious medals, awarded for conquering various countries, on the grass, at the feet of those who had chased him, but he would not let the girl go. Covered with foam, his steed had carried him to the dugouts on the bank of the Ob. Carefully, the vizier took the firmly bound girl from his steed and placed her in a boat. Then he jumped in after her. But while he was pushing the boat off from the bank, an arrow from the pursuit, which had just caught up, pierced him.</p><p>The current bore the boat away. The vizier, shot through by the arrow, lay on the stern and did not even watch the three boats of rowers drawing closer and closer with the soldiers. He looked tenderly at the maiden, who sat there calmly, silently, and was himself silent. He didn't have the strength to say anything. The Siberian girl looked at him, too, then glanced at his pursuers and barely smiled, either at them or something else, tore the ropes from her arms and threw them into the water. The young Siberian girl took up the oars. And the pursuit's dugouts could not catch up with her boat, where the wounded vizier lay.</p><p>Where, into what times, did the water's current carry them, and what now, in this instant, was the cloudy river water carrying away in its memory about us?</p><p>Would the river think the big cities most important? Today, Novosibirsk, a huge city, stands on the Ob's banks, closer to its sources. Can you feel its size and grandeur, River? Of course, it is clear to me that you might say the river water, once life-giving, is so dirty that no one can drink it. But what are we supposed to do? Where can we dispose our factories' waste? After all, we're developing, not like our ancestors. We have lots of scientists now who live in the many academic towns around Novosibirsk. If we don't pour our sewage into you, we will choke ourselves. Even now, the stench has made it hard to breathe in the city, and in some districts you can't tell what it is exactly that stinks. Try to understand all this, River. You know what kind of equipment we have now. Diesel ships glide over you now, not silent dugouts. My ship has moved over your waters, as well.</p><p>I wonder whether the river remembers me. Me on the ship, the largest passenger ship we had. The ship wasn't new, of course, and at full steam all its diesel engines and propeller made such a racket, we could barely listen to music in the bar.</p><p>What does the river consider most important and retain in its memory? Before, I would look at its banks from the high deck of my ship, from the windows of the aft bar, to the sounds of Malinin's songs and ballads:</p><p> </p><p>On a fine white horse, I'd ride to town,</p><p>For the tavern mistress's smile fair,</p><p>On the bridge, I caught the miller's scowl,</p><p>And with the tavern's mistress spent the night.</p><p> </p><p>At the time, the people going about their business on the banks had seemed trifling and insignificant. Now I was one of them.</p><p>I also thought about how I was going to convince Anastasia not to prevent me from having contact with my son. Such a strange situation had come about. All my life I'd dreamed of a son. I'd imagined playing with him when he was little. Then raise him. When my son grew up he would be a good helper to me. We would be in business together. I have a son now, and though he's not near me, it's still nice to know that a being so close to me and so desired exists on this earth. Before my departure, I'd taken tremendous satisfaction in buying all kinds of unnecessary children's things for my baby. Buying is one thing. Whether I would be able to give them was still a question. If I'd had my son by an ordinary woman, whether from the country or the city—it didn't matter—everything would be simple and clear. Almost any woman would like to know that the father of her child was concerned and trying to give the child everything he needed and to take part in his upbringing. If a man doesn't do this voluntarily, many women sue for support. But Anastasia was a taiga hermit, and she had her own views on life, her own understanding of values. Even before my son's birth, she told me, "He has no need of any material goods as you understand them. He will have everything from the very beginning. You will undoubtedly want to bring the baby some pointless rattle, but he absolutely doesn't need it. You need it for your self-satisfaction: 'How good and concerned I am.'"</p><p>My goodness. "He has no need of any material goods." But what can a parent give his newborn then, especially his father? It's still too soon to give the nursing infant a fatherly upbringing. How can I express my love toward him then? How can I express my concern? The mother nurses him, so it's easier for her. She's already involved, but what is the father supposed to do? In civilized conditions, he can help around the house and worry about the family's material well-being. But Anastasia doesn't need all that. She has nothing but her taiga glade. Her hearth takes care of itself and actually takes complete care of her. Therefore, it will also serve the baby when it sees he comes from her. I wonder what kind of money it would take to have something like that? Buying or leasing five hectares of land long term isn't that hard now, but how and for what money can you buy the love and devotion of a wolf, bear, bugs, and eagle? Anastasia herself may not need any of our civilization's achievements, but why should the child suffer for his mother's world-view? The child doesn't even have normal toys. Here, too, she sees everything her own way. "A child does not need pointless rattles. They harm him. They lead him away from the truth," she says.</p><p>I think her statements are either utter superstition or at least have a definite kink. Did humanity really invent so many different toys for children for nothing? But so as not to argue with Anastasia, I didn't buy any rattles but I did buy an erector set that had this written on the box: "Play for the development of children's intellect." And I bought the disposable diapers the whole world uses. And baby food, too. Which simply delighted me with its convenience of preparation. You open the box, and inside is a hermetically sealed, waterproof foil package. You cut open the packet with scissors, sprinkle the powder into warm water, stir, and it's all ready. There are different kinds of powder: buckwheat, rice, and other cereals.</p><p>It also says on the box that it contains various vitamin supplements. I remember before, when my daughter Polina was still very little, I had to go to the community kitchen every day for her food, while here I'd bought a box and you could feed my child without any problem. You didn't even have to cook it. Mix it in water and that's it. I knew Anastasia did not boil water and therefore before buying a lot I bought one box. I tried mixing the powder in the box with room temperature water, and it dissolved. I tasted it and it tasted fine, only bland because there was no salt, though for children it probably shouldn't have salt. I decided Anastasia wouldn't be able to find any arguments against this powder. It's absurd to refuse this kind of convenience. And she would have to have some respect for our technocratic world. It not only produces weapons but thinks about children, too. However, what worried me most from what Anastasia had said—primarily because it was incomprehensible—was the following: Anastasia had said that for me to have contact with my son, I had to achieve a certain purity of intentions and cleanse myself internally, only I didn't know what specifically I was supposed to cleanse myself of.</p><p>It would have been easier to understand if she had said I had to shave, or stop smoking, and, when I approached the child, wear clean clothing. But she spoke of consciousness and internal cleansing. Where do they sell the brush to cleanse something inside you? What was so very dirty inside me? I may not be better than others, but I'm no worse, either. If every woman started presenting the man with demands like this, one big purgatory would have to be set up for humanity. This is illegal. I've brought Anastasia an excerpt from the Civil Code which says that one parent does not have the right to deprive the other without grounds of the opportunity to see his own child, even if the parents are divorced. Of course, our laws mean little to Anastasia, but this is still a weighty argument. After all, most people follow the laws. I also could have spoken more sternly with Anastasia. She and I should have equal rights to the child. I'd had the idea of speaking more sternly with her before, too, but now I'd had second thoughts about my original decision. Here's why: in my backpack, along with everything else, were readers' letters. I didn't take them all because a great many letters come in. They wouldn't have all fit. In many letters readers regard Anastasia with understanding. They call her a messiah, a taiga fairy, a goddess, and dedicate poems and songs to her. Some speak to her as if she were their closest friend. This stream of letters compelled me to make a great effort to make sense of my own actions and statements.</p><p>I had to sit on the bank by Egorich's launch for three hours or so. Night was approaching when I saw two men coming toward me and Egorich's grandson with them. The first, elderly, looked to be about sixty. He was wearing a canvas raincoat and rubber boots and had a flushed face. He'd obviously been drinking because he swayed slightly as he walked. The other, younger, about thirty, was sturdily built. When they came closer I saw streaks of gray in the younger Siberian's dark brown hair. The older man started to speak as soon as he got close.</p><p>"Hey there, traveler! Want to see Anastasia? We'll take you. Get out five hundred thousand for carriage plus two bottles."</p><p>I already knew I wasn't the only one trying to get to Anastasia, which was why his fee was so high. For them I was just another pilgrim going where Anastasia resided. But I still asked, "Why do you think I need to see some Anastasia and not just go to the village?"</p><p>"Okay, the village, if you say so. Get out your five hundred anyway. If you don't have five hundred, we won't take you to the village."</p><p>Egorich was not speaking very nicely to me.</p><p>"They take that much money for transport and aren't friendly," I thought. "Why is that?"</p><p>I had no choice but to agree, though. But instead of being happy about the money and, most importantly, the two bottles of vodka, which he sent his younger partner off for, Egorich treated me with even more hostility. He sat down on a rock next to me and muttered to himself.</p><p>"The village. . . . What village? Six houses of people barely alive—the whole village. Nobody needs that village."</p><p>"Do you take visitors to see Anastasia often? Is it a good business transporting them?" I asked Egorich to get the conversation going and temper his hostility. But Egorich answered with irritation.</p><p>"Who invited them? Uninvited dolts hauling themselves there. Nothing stops them. Did she invite them? Did she? No! She told one about her life. He wrote a book. Fine. Write. But why give away the place? We never did. He meets her once and writes about her whole life, and gives away the place. Even the old women realized she'd have no peace if it was given away."</p><p>"You mean you've read the book about Anastasia?"</p><p>"I don't read books. Sasha, my partner, likes to read books. But we won't take you to the village right away. Too far. The propeller on the launch is kind of weak. We'll go as far as the fishing shack and spend the night there. In the morning Sasha will take you the rest of the way while I fish."</p><p>"So be it," I agreed, and I thought, "It's good Egorich doesn't know I'm the author of the book about Anastasia."</p><p>Sasha, Egorich's buddy, brought the vodka. They stowed the fishing tackle in the boat, and then Egorich's grandson Vasyatka nearly scotched the trip. He started asking Egorich for money for a new radio.</p><p>"I've already hauled a pole over for the antenna and figured out how to put it up," Vasyatka said, "and I have the wire for the antenna. When you attach the antenna to the radio you catch lots of different stations."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0302>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>2. Money for Tomfoolery?</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>"See what a smart grandson I have?" Egorich boasted with a warmth in his voice. "Curious, and skillful. Good job, Vasyatka. Someone needs to give him some money."</p><p>The hint was clear, and I started getting out my money, but Vasyatka, emboldened by the praise, continued.</p><p>"I have to hear absolutely everything about the cosmonauts. Ours and the Americans. When I grow up I'm going to be a cosmonaut myself."</p><p>"What's that? What's that you said?" Egorich was suddenly on his guard.</p><p>"When I grow up I'm going to be a cosmonaut."</p><p>"Well, you won't get any money from me for that kind of utter tomfoolery, Vasyatka."</p><p>"It's not tomfoolery at all to be a cosmonaut. Everybody likes cosmonauts. They're heroes and they get shown on television. They're flying around the Earth all the time in big old spaceships. They talk to all kinds of scientists directly from space."</p><p>"And what good comes of their yammering? They're flying there while there are fewer and fewer fish in the Ob."</p><p>"Cosmonauts tell all the people about the weather. They know in advance what the weather's going to be on the whole Earth tomorrow," Vasyatka continued to defend science.</p><p>"Big deal. You can go to granny Marfa. Ask granny Marfa and she'll tell you the weather for tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and next year. And she won't take any money. What about your cosmonauts? Your cosmonauts are squandering Petka's money. Your father's money."</p><p>"The state gives the cosmonauts lots of money."</p><p>"And where is this state of yours getting the money? Where the hell does the state get it? From Petka, your father. That's where the state gets the money. I caught fish and Petka sold it in town, and he wanted to be a smart businessman, but the state says to him, "Pay taxes, give us all your money, we have lots of expenses. And in the Duma they keep yammering, worse than women at a well. They thought it all up, made it all up, and they think they're geniuses. They have all kinds of conveniences there, they use nice clean toilets, smart ones, but the water in the river keeps getting dirtier. You're not getting any money, Vasyatka, until you air that tomfoolery from your head. And I'm not going anywhere anymore, I'm not going to make money for tomfoolery."</p><p>It was probably the drink that made Egorich flare up so strongly that he nearly turned down the trip. Later, after he'd drunk some vodka straight from the bottle Sasha'd brought and lit a cigarette, he calmed down a little and we climbed into the launch. He never did give Vasyatka any money, and he kept muttering something about tomfoolery under his breath the whole way.</p><p>The launch's old motor rattled badly, making it hard to talk. We made our way in silence to an old fishing shack with just one small window. The first stars were appearing in the night sky.</p><p>Egorich, who had finished off the bottle of vodka started on the bank in the launch, muttered to his Sasha, "I'm off to sleep. Set up here by the fire or on the shack floor. Come dawn, take him to our spot."</p><p>Egorich had already bent over to enter the shack's tiny door, but he turned around and repeated sternly, "Ours! Under-s-stood, Sasha?"</p><p>"Understood," Sasha replied calmly.</p><p>When we were sitting by the fire and eating fish baked in the coals, I asked Sasha a question about what Egorich said that had put me on my guard.</p><p>"Alexander, can you tell me what this 'spot' of yours is where Egorich told you to take me?"</p><p>"Our spot is on the bank opposite the village, and from there you can get to Anastasia's glade," Alexander answered me calmly.</p><p>"That's great! You accept all that money and don't take me where I need to go?"</p><p>"Yes, that's what we do. That's all we can do for Anastasia to make up for our guilt before her."</p><p>"What guilt? And why did you admit this to me? How are you going to put me off at 'your spot' now?"</p><p>"I'll moor the launch wherever you say. As for the money, I'll give you back my share."</p><p>"And why are you doing this for me?"</p><p>"I recognized you. I recognized you immediately, Vladimir Megre. I read your book and saw your photo on the cover. I'll take you where you say. Only I have to tell you . . . You need to treat what I tell you calmly. Reasonably. You shouldn't go into the taiga. You won't make it. Anastasia's gone. I think she went deep into the taiga. Or somewhere else we don't know about. You won't make it now. You'll die yourself. Or hunters will shoot you. Hunters don't take kindly to outsiders on their lands. They deal with outsiders at a distance so as not to subject themselves to excess danger."</p><p>Outwardly Alexander was speaking almost calmly, only the stick he was using to stir the fire was shaking clumsily, and the sparks were shooting up like fireworks, disturbingly, into the night.</p><p>"Did something happen here? What? You recognized me, so tell me. What happened? Why did Anastasia leave?"</p><p>"I'd like to tell someone," Alexander replied in a subdued voice, "to tell someone who could understand. I don't know where to start to make you understand or to make me understand."</p><p>"Tell it simply, the way it was."</p><p>"Simply? It's true. It's all very simple, so simple it will shock you. Listen calmly and, if you can, don't interrupt."</p><p>"I won't. Get to the point. Don't drag it out."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0303>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>3. Uninvited Guests</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>Alexander started speaking with Siberian calm, but I could still sense the inner agitation in this young, graying Siberian's soul.</p><p>"When I read your book, Anastasia, I was a graduate student at Moscow University. I was fascinated by philosophy and psychology. I was studying the religions of the East. With enthusiasm. And all of a sudden: Anastasia. Not at the back of beyond, but right next to my home, in Siberia, where I was born. Such tremendous power, logic, and meaning I felt in her words! I felt something dear and significant to me. Compared with this unusual feeling rising in me, foreign teachings paled. I abandoned it all and rushed home, as if I were rushing from the dark to the light. I wanted to see Anastasia, talk to her. I came home and started going with Egorich in the launch to the spot on the bank that you described in the book. Egorich and I figured it out. From time to time, others, too, began to try meeting Anastasia. They would ask questions about that spot. But we didn't take anyone to it. The locals had the sense to figure it out and not encourage the pilgrims. One day, though, we, or rather I, without Egorich, took a whole group to the spot."</p><p>"Why did you do that?"</p><p>"At the time I thought I was doing the right thing, for the good. There were six of them. They seemed to be two prominent scientists with major resources. Or those who backed them and had sent them had major resources. The other four were guards, armed with revolvers. They had other weapons in their arsenal, too, and walkie-talkies. They asked me to be their guide, and I agreed—not for the money. First I talked to them for a long time. They didn't try to hide the fact that the goal of their expedition was to meet Anastasia. Their leader, a handsome, gray-haired man, Boris Moiseyevich, realized that Anastasia alone could do more for science than many scientific institutes.</p><p>"They planned to take her out of the taiga and create conditions for her to live in a nature preserve and to provide security. Boris Moiseyevich said, 'If we don't do this, someone else will, and anything could happen. Anastasia is an unusual phenomenon, and we're obliged to protect and study it.'</p><p>"Boris Moiseyevich's assistant, Stanislav, an intelligent young man, was basically in love with Anastasia, although long-distance. I agreed with their arguments. They rented a small ship from a cooperative. They brought barrels of aviation fuel to the ship in a van.</p><p>"When we reached the spot, they set up their tents on the high bank and radioed their location to the helicopter.</p><p>"The helicopter was equipped for aerial and video photography and had some other unusual equipment on it. Every day, the helicopter flew low over the taiga, photographing sector by sector.</p><p>"Every day, the two scientists examined the shots. Occasionally they themselves rode in the helicopter to places that interested them. They were searching for Anastasia's glade, where they planned to land. I imagined the racket the helicopter would make landing in Anastasia's glade, terrifying every living thing. I thought about Anastasia's little baby and how the roaring helicopter might frighten him, too. I started suggesting to the scientists that after they'd determined the glade's location they not land the helicopter there. I suggested to the scientists that after they'd discovered the glade from the helicopter they make a map and go to the glade on foot. But Stanislav explained that it would be hard for Boris Moiseyevich to make such a long journey through the taiga. Stanislav also shared my concerns about disturbing the peace of the taiga's inhabitants, but he assured me that Boris Moiseyevich would be able to gradually reassure both Anastasia and the baby. On the fourth day it all happened."</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"When the helicopter had flown off for another video shoot and we were doing whatever we were doing, one of the guards saw a solitary female figure approaching our camp from the direction of the taiga. He told Boris Moiseyevich. Soon after, the entire camp was watching the approaching woman. She was wearing a light blouse and a long skirt, and her kerchief was tied so as to cover both her forehead and her neck. We stood there in a group, with Boris Moiseyevich and Stanislav in front. The woman walked up to us. There was neither fear nor embarrassment on her face. Her eyes . . . her unusual eyes looked gently, benignly, at the people, and this gaze warmed us. She seemed to look not at everyone at once, but at each one individually. An incomprehensible excitement gripped us all. As if each had forgotten everything and was reveling, luxuriating, in the warmth that radiated from her extraordinary gaze. No one even invited her to sit down after her journey.</p><p>"She was the first to speak. In a calm and incredibly kind voice she said, 'Good day to you, people.'</p><p>"And we're standing there in silence. Boris Moiseyevich was the first to speak to her.</p><p>"'Hello,' he answered for everyone. 'Would you please introduce yourself? Who are you?'</p><p>"'My name is Anastasia. I have come to you with a request. Call back your helicopter, please. It is bad for these parts. You're looking for me. Here I am. I will answer the questions you have that I can answer.'</p><p>"'Yes, of course, we were looking for you. Thank you for coming yourself. This solves so many problems,' Boris Moiseyevich began. He did not invite her to sit down either, although there was a table and folding chairs next to the tent, and he did not ask Anastasia to step aside with him. Her unexpected appearance must have unnerved him, too. He immediately began talking about the purpose of our visit.</p><p>"'Yes, very good. You came to see us yourself, and we have actually come for you. Don't be alarmed. We'll call back the helicopter.'</p><p>"Boris Moiseyevich gave instructions to the senior guard to radio the helicopter commander and bring him back to camp. The instruction was immediately carried out. Then he turned to Anastasia and began speaking with her more calmly and confidently.</p><p>"'Anastasia, the helicopter will come right away. You will get in it with our colleagues. You will show our colleagues the glade where you live with your son. The helicopter will land where you indicate and you will collect your son. We will take you and him to a nature preserve outside Moscow. Everything in the preserve will be set up as you say. The way it should be. No one will disturb you there. This preserve is under continuous guard. After you settle there, the guard will be increased. Only occasionally, at a time convenient for you, scientists will come to talk to you. These will be people who have sufficiently prepared. You will find interacting with them interesting, and your interpretations of certain natural and social phenomena and your philosophy will be interesting to them. If you wish, you will have a most worthy assistant. This person, who will be constantly by your side, will be able to catch your meaning quickly. Despite his youth, he is already a prominent, talented scientist. In addition, he is in love with you long-distance, and I think you are worthy of each other and could be a handsome, happy couple. He is worthy of you not only because of his learnedness but also because of his way of life. He is here.' Boris Moiseyevich turned toward Stanislav, gestured to him, and called him forward.</p><p>"'Come closer, Stanislav. What's wrong with you? Introduce yourself.'</p><p>"Stanislav walked up, facing Anastasia, and although a little embarrassed, began to speak.</p><p>"'Boris Moiseyevich seems to be my matchmaker. This may seem unexpected to you, Anastasia, but I truly am prepared to propose to you. I am prepared to adopt your son and treat him like my own child. I am prepared to help you resolve many problems, and I ask you to think of me as a friend.'</p><p>"Stanislav bowed his head to Anastasia elegantly, took her hand, and kissed it. He was elegant. A fine specimen. If Anastasia had worn different clothes, they might indeed have looked like a handsome and notable couple.</p><p>"Anastasia replied to Stanislav gently and seriously.</p><p>"'Thank you for your kind attitude toward me. Thank you for your concern for me.' She added, 'If you indeed feel strong enough to direct your love and make the life of another person happier and fuller, then remember that among the women you know, the women around you, there may be someone dissatisfied with life, a woman unhappy over something. Turn your attention to her. Love her, and make her happy.'</p><p>"'But I want to love you, Anastasia.'</p><p>"'I am happy with someone else. Do not waste your efforts on me. There are women who need you more.'</p><p>"Boris Moiseyevich decided to help Stanislav.</p><p>"'This other man you have come to meet, Anastasia? Of course, you mean Vladimir. He is far from the best our society has to offer.'</p><p>"'These kinds of assessments coming from you will not change my feelings. I cannot control my feelings.'</p><p>"'But why did you meet with Vladimir specifically? A man far from spirituality and science or even a normal way of life. He is just an ordinary entrepreneur. Why did you fall in love with him specifically?'</p><p>"At a certain point I suddenly began to understand," Alexander continued. "Boris Moiseyevich, Stanislav, and the entire group that had come with us had a specific goal: to collect—to snatch—Anastasia by any means and use her only in certain interests of their own, even against her will. It didn't matter whose idea it was, their own or an order from higher up. They were going to try to carry out what had been conceived. No arguments, even the weightiest, were going to stop them. Anastasia may have realized this as well. There is no doubt she could not have failed to know, to sense their intentions. Nevertheless, she continued to treat the men standing in front of her like good, dear people. She spoke sincerely and frankly with us about what was most precious, and this attitude and sincerity restrained, or rather, repulsed, any violence. So fully did she parry the attempts by Boris Moiseyevich and Stanislav to cool her attitude toward you that she rendered their arguments on this topic meaningless.</p><p>"They say a woman in love sees only the good in the man she loves, no matter what he's done or what he is in fact like. But her arguments were of a different sort. When my first excitement after Anastasia's appearance had passed, I was able to switch on my voice recorder very quietly.</p><p>"Later I often listened to and analyzed what Anastasia had said. I remember everything. . . . And this 'everything' has turned my consciousness around."</p><p>"What's turned your consciousness around?" I wondered how Anastasia had spoken about me.</p><p>Alexander continued.</p><p>"After Boris Moiseyevich asked, 'Why did you fall in love with him specifically?' Anastasia replied simply at first.</p><p>"'It's pointless to ask me that. No one in love can explain why they love the one they love. For every woman in love, only one man is the best and most important in the world, only her chosen one. And for me, my beloved is the best.'</p><p>"'Still, even you, Anastasia, cannot fail to understand the absurdity of your choice. It may have been an accident, but it's still absurd. Your will, abilities, and analytical mind should cool your initial impulse and explain to you just how unsound this person is compared with others. Give this some thought.'</p><p>"'My thoughts speak quite to the opposite. In this case it is pointless to waste time on them. They merely increase the puzzling necessity of what occurred. Everything must be accepted as it is.'</p><p>"'Accept absurdity? Paradox?'</p><p>"'It only looks that way at first glance. You have journeyed far from Moscow. You met with difficulties reaching this spot on the bank. You ask me a question about my love. But you do not suspect that this is a paradox—that events in Moscow shed greater clarity regarding this love. You would do better giving thought to them there. You did not have to come so far.'</p><p>"'What events occurred in Moscow?'</p><p>"'They are simple outwardly, but only outwardly. As you say, Vladimir is a simple and in no way remarkable, sinful man who abandoned everything and went to Moscow from Siberia immediately after meeting me. He went to keep his promise to me: to organize a society of entrepreneurs with the purest intentions. He no longer had any money, but he acted.</p><p>"'In Moscow there is a two-story building at 14 Tolmakov Lane. People once worked there who headed up the first association of entrepreneurs. Then the association's leaders left. The association was dying.</p><p>"'Vladimir walked into that building, and its deserted offices, big and small, began coming to life. There he wrote all kinds of letters and appealed to entrepreneurs. He worked in his office from early in the morning until late at night and stayed there to sleep. People came to see him. People turned up and began helping him, people who believed in him and what he was doing. I asked him to do this when he was at my glade in the taiga. I told Vladimir how important this was.</p><p>"'I constructed and laid out a plan of action for him. The goals could be reached by carrying out the plan constructed by my dream in sequence. But he was supposed to write the book first, and with its help, clarify a great deal and disseminate the information. The book was supposed to find and unite entrepreneurs with pure intentions and give him the means to carry out this plan.</p><p>"'But Vladimir did everything the way he himself understood and considered correct. He barely thought of me. He understood the significance of what had been conceived and lived for it. Following his own path, he broke the sequence.</p><p>"'He could not reach his goal this way, but he did not know this and acted with incredible persistence and inventiveness. Other people came to help him who believed in the idea. Slowly shoots of a new association of entrepreneurs poked through. It was unbelievable, but he did accomplish a little. They had gathered, entrepreneurs with the purest intentions. A list of their addresses exists, and you can be convinced yourselves.'</p><p>"'We've read that list. It was published in the first edition of the book. But I must disenchant you, Anastasia. Disenchant you. The list also includes enterprises like Kristall, a Moscow factory that produces alcoholic beverages. Its output is incompatible with the concept of what is spiritual.'</p><p>"'Everything in the world is relative. Kristall may not be the worst compared to others. In addition, we are talking about intentions capable of changing everything. Today's matter is the fruit of yesterday's intention.'</p><p>"'I cannot agree with that statement. However, your Vladimir was unable to organize an association of entrepreneurs with pure intentions. I assure you, Anastasia, you have bet on the wrong man.'</p><p>"'By disturbing the outline of events, Vladimir could not arrive at his goal. He did not have the elementary resources or funds to disseminate information even beyond Moscow. Unfavorable circumstances took shape and he lost his offices for continuing his work, his means of communication and lodging. He left the building, which is on Tolmakov Lane in Moscow. He left with a small group of people—the Muscovites who had been helping him. He left without any money to survive. He could not pay his assistants' wages, having no housing or even winter clothing. He had left and been left by his family. And do you know what he spoke about with that small group of Muscovites as they headed for the subway down that frosty street? He discussed how to start all over. Even in that state he was building a plan and trying to do something. He is an entrepreneur. They, the Muscovites, followed, listened, and believed him. They loved him.'</p><p>"'What for, if I may ask?'</p><p>"'You will have to ask them, those Muscovites, why, what they saw in him. Go to the building on Tolmakov Lane and ask the building guard why, while taking turns on their shifts, they brought food in jars and different packets of food and each time tried to feed him supper. They tried to do this in such a way as not to insult him with their offering. These men, these guards, who did not work for him, cooked all kinds of soups and borschts at home and brought them, so that he could have a little home cooking. They loved him. Why?</p><p>"'When you go to that building, also talk to the pretty woman who worked there as a secretary, a former actress, she played the lead in Through Hardships to the Stars, she played a good alien. She played it very well, in a very good film that called on people to protect and love the earth. Ask her why, while working for another firm in that same building, she tried to and did help Vladimir surreptitiously. She was not his secretary, but she helped him. Why did she try to bring my beloved coffee or tea for his dinner? She set up everything as if it were her firm that was supplying her with sugar, cookies, and tea. In fact, she brought all that from her own home. She was not rich. She loved him. Why?</p><p>"'While he, Vladimir, was nonetheless losing strength and dying. His physical strength was running out. But even in his premortal state, he was trying to reach his goal. Yes, he is an entrepreneur, and his spirit is strong.'</p><p>"'Anastasia, you're speaking in allegories. What do you mean by "he was nonetheless dying"? Is this in the figurative sense?'</p><p>"'It is in the literal sense. For a few days in Moscow, his flesh was nearly dead. Ordinarily in that state people lie without moving. But he was walking and acting.'</p><p>"'Perhaps thanks to you, Anastasia?'</p><p>"'For all those forty-two horrible hours I did not cease warming him with my ray for a single second, a single instant. But this was not enough. My ray could not maintain life in a body where the spirit was weakening. But Vladimir's spirit fought. In its aspirations, his spirit did not notice death's arrival. It helped the ray. Then other rays appeared to help mine. They were very very weak and unconscious, but they were there. These were the rays of those who surrounded and loved him in Moscow.</p><p>"'His nearly dead flesh began to fill with life. In the face of sincere love, if it is sufficient, death retreats. Man's immortality is in love, in his ability to inspire love for himself.'</p><p>"'Dead flesh cannot walk. You are still speaking allegorically, unscientifically.'</p><p>"'The science of human criteria is always provisional. There are truths not only for the present day.'</p><p>"'But how then are today's scientists to be convinced? We need readings from impartial instruments.'</p><p>"'Fine. The Kursk train station. There is a photomat in the subway there. On one of those days Vladimir took a small color photograph of himself for a permit. This photograph may still be at the building at 42 Lenin Prospect. Vladimir may have it, too. Look closely and you will see all the signs of a dead body, even the discolorations of a corpse; the photomat recorded the spots on his face. But you will also see life in his eyes. The spirit of struggle.'</p><p>"'Nonetheless, only you could save him, Anastasia. Tell us, why did you expend so much of your own efforts on him specifically? Why?'</p><p>"'I alone was not involved in his rescue. Ask the three Moscow students why they rented an apartment for him with their own money. Why did they, when he finally realized the reason for his failures and began writing the book, during their semester, make money wherever they could and spend their nights typing the text Vladimir wrote on their computers? Why? You can ask this question of many Muscovites who were by his side in difficult moments. The mystery's solution is in them, not me. Why did Moscow and its people safeguard him, help and believe in him?</p><p>"'It is Moscow that wrote the book, too. I am enraptured by that city! I have come to love it! No growling iron machines or insane cataclysms caused by the technocratic world could ever wipe from the souls of those living in this city their sense of good and love. Many in this city are striving for what is good and light—for love. Through the growling mechanisms and the confusion they sense its great power and grace.'</p><p>"'But Anastasia, what you're saying truly is incredible and stunning. It couldn't have happened all by itself. This proves yet again how incredible your abilities are and the unprecedented capabilities of the ray you wield. You obviously shone it on the Muscovites in contact with Vladimir. You aren't going to deny you did that, are you? And all the miracles were created by you.'</p><p>"'Love created the miracles. I did use my ray to cautiously touch everyone who interacted with Vladimir. But I only strengthened slightly the feelings they already had of good, love, and striving for the light. I only strengthened what was inside them. And the book was published by Moscow. The first print run was small and the book was slim. But people bought it. It sold out quickly. Vladimir did not distort the events that occurred in the taiga. He honestly set forth the sensations he experienced there. To many readers I appeared smart and good and Vladimir foolish and dimwitted.</p><p>"'People in their homes read what was set forth without taking into consideration the fact that Vladimir had been with me one on one in the remote Siberian taiga. For him, all this was too unusual then. I do not know who else might have gone so far into the taiga without any gear. Or how he would behave when he saw what he saw. Vladimir described the events honestly. To many he looked foolish. Here you are asking the question of why him specifically. Why do I love him so?</p><p>"'When the book was being written, Vladimir had already grasped a great deal in a different way. He grasps everything very quickly. Those who have had occasion to speak with him could not help but notice this. But Vladimir did not try to embellish his former self.'"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0304>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>4. Notes of the Universe</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>"Anastasia spoke of you with warmth," Alexander continued. "She knew everything about people and events. She said, 'The first, still small, print run of the book Vladimir wrote came out in Moscow, and immediately there were ecstatic responses, poems, pictures, and songs. The book preserves—thanks to the sincerity of its exposition—the combinations and symbols I searched for in the Universe. It is these that gave rise in people to unusual, beneficial, all-healing feelings.'</p><p>"At these words of Anastasia's, Boris Moiseyevich began bustling about and suddenly sat down at the table by the tent. I saw that he had tried stealthily to turn on his voice recorder. In the pursuit of certain important information he had probably stopped paying any attention to those around him. He never did ask Anastasia to sit and thought only about how to get as much information out of her as quickly as he could. Agitated, the gray-haired scientist asked questions.</p><p>"'Scientists in various countries are using special expensive instruments to try to catch the unusual sounds of the universe. The sounds exist. Science knows this—maybe not everyone yet, only some. Maybe one-billionth. What instrument do you use to catch them, Anastasia? What instrument can produce the selection of sounds capable of purposefully influencing the human psyche?'</p><p>"'We have had that instrument for a long time. It is called the human soul. The soul's mood and purity accept or reject sounds.'</p><p>"'Yes, that's fine. Yes. Let's say that. You have been able to. You have been able to find and select out of billions the best sounds of the Universe and then also their combinations. But a sound can only be reproduced with the help of an instrument, a specific musical instrument. What does the book have to do with this? It can't make sounds, after all.'</p><p>"'No, it can't. It serves as sheet music. The reader involuntarily pronounces the sounds being read inside himself, so the combinations hidden in the text sound in the soul in their undistorted, primordial form. They both bear the Truth and healing and inspire the soul. A manmade instrument is incapable of producing what sounds in the soul.'</p><p>"'How did Vladimir preserve all your signs without knowing anything about them himself?'</p><p>"'I learned Vladimir's turns of speech, and I knew in advance that Vladimir would not distort events or the essence of what he had heard and would even present himself as he was. But he did not convey all the combinations of signs. He needed to continue writing. After all, he had set forth only a little of what he knew and comprehended when he began writing. He needed to continue writing. Fame had already touched him. Unprecedented fame, and with a little more effort he could organize the association of entrepreneurs. All of a sudden Vladimir took a step unforeseen by my dream. He left his paid-for Moscow apartment to the Muscovites around him, left them the opportunity to accept readers' compliments, boarded a train, and left Moscow.'</p><p>"'Why did he do that?'</p><p>"'He kept wanting to find confirmation for what I'd said. Confirmation by science, validation of the existence of various things I had spoken about—to touch them. So he decided not to write anymore. He left for the Caucasus. Vladimir left Moscow in order to see with his own eyes, in the Caucasus Mountains, the dolmens, the ancient sites where living people had gone to die ten thousand years ago. I had told him about this. I had also told him what important functional significance these dolmens have for people today.'</p><p>"'Vladimir went to a town called Gelendzhik. In the museums of Krasnodar, Novorossiisk, and Gelendzhik he collected materials on dolmens. Then he met with various scientists, archeologists, and local historians who worked on dolmens. He ended up with more information about dolmens than in any one museum. Naturally, I tried to help him imperceptibly. Through the mouths of people who came to see him, I instilled much new information in him, so that he would have the chance to compare and to draw his own conclusions. But only he himself acted quickly and decisively. He compared all the information he had gathered with what I had told him. When the archeologists showed him the dolmen closest to the road, he learned that there had been still more, but that they had been destroyed because the local residents had not understood their proper significance. The dolmens had been of little interest to them at all. Vladimir did what might have seemed incredible. In three months he changed the local residents' attitude toward the dolmens. They began taking flowers to them. At the initiative of Gelendzhik's local women historians, a public association was created. It was called Anastasia, in my honor. This association opened a school for tour guides so that they could tell visitors about the dolmens, preserve the dolmens, and protect rather than destroy them. They also began preparing new tours and called them "Excursions into the Intellect."</p><p>"'In Gelendzhik, the tour guides began talking about the significance of the primary sources and the Creator's great creations—about nature.'</p><p>"'Anastasia, do you think this is all thanks to him? You played no role here?'</p><p>"'If I could have done so much without him, I would have done it before. I wanted very much to do this. In one of the remote dolmens in those mountains, the flesh of my foremother died.'</p><p>"'But how? How could one person no one has ever heard of change peoples' attitude in such a short period of time? And be able to organize an effective association? You say that the scientific materials and various publications were known to the local residents, since they knew about them in the museums. But that didn't excite people.'</p><p>"'Yes, that's true.'</p><p>"'But why did they listen to him specifically? How did he succeed? Peoples' beliefs can't be changed that quickly.'</p><p>"'Vladimir did not know that. He did not know that consciousness cannot be changed quickly, which is why he acted and did change it. Go to that town and ask the various people who joined this association. Find out how and why success smiled on Vladimir.'</p><p>"'I rejoiced in what was happening in that town. The Anastasia Association—he agreed to this name when they asked him. I decided it was because of me. I thought he was starting to understand and love me. Truly, he had understood a lot, but he had not come to love me. He had not because I made many mistakes and sinned.'</p><p>"'Soon after, I came to understand, to realize that my dream would come true, that people would be carried across the dark forces' span of time and be happy! What I had dreamed of would come true, except for reciprocated love. This was retribution for the mistakes I made, my imperfection, and the insufficient purity of my intentions.'</p><p>"'What happened? What made you decide this?</p><p>"'Actually, everyone has long understood that he is crude and vulgar. Believe me, Anastasia, as someone older in years and as the father of a family, I tell you that your parents would not have approved such a union either.'</p><p>"'Please, you must not speak like that about someone dear to me. Vladimir seems crude to some, but I know something different.'</p><p>"'What else is there to know about him? Everyone knows what an entrepreneur can be, and he is a typical entrepreneur of our era. This is clear to everyone. Anastasia, your attitude toward Vladimir is biased.'</p><p>"'Be that as it may, it is mine. Also, you're wrong about my parents' opinion.'"</p><p>

The Spirit of my Foremother</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>"'One morning I realized,' Anastasia said softly, and her gaze seemed to go deep into the past. 'That morning, Vladimir was not at home in his rented apartment. I couldn't find him with my ray. The day had begun on which many centuries ago my foremother had died in a dolmen. I always remember her on that day. I try to speak to her. And she speaks to me. You, too, go to the cemetery on that day in memory of your relatives, to think about them and talk. I do this without leaving the glade. My ray helps me speak and see at a distance, and they feel my ray. That day, I was remembering my foremother and trying to speak with her, as always, but I did not sense her replies. Not at all. She was not reacting to me. This had never happened before. Then I started searching for her dolmen with my ray. I found it. I shone my light on it as hard as I could. My foremother did not react. Something unknown to me had happened. The spirit of my foremother was not in the dolmen.'</p><p>"'Anastasia, please explain what you mean by a person's spirit. What does it consist of?'</p><p>"'Of everything invisible that there is in a person, including certain predilections and sensations acquired during his mortal existence.'</p><p>"'Does the spirit possess an energy analogous to one of the known energies?'</p><p>"'Yes. It is an energy set consisting of multiple energies. After the corporeal existence of a particular individual ceases, some of these sets are subject to disintegration into individual energies and are then used in plant and animal combinations, essential natural phenomena.'</p><p>"'What is their power? What energy potential does a set of energies that have not been disengaged have?'</p><p>"They're different for each. The very weakest cannot even overcome gravitational energy. It will disintegrate later anyway.'</p><p>"'Gravitational? The very weakest—can one see its manifestations in something, perceive or feel it?'</p><p>"'Naturally. A tornado, for example.'</p><p>"'A tornado? A tornado that rips up trees by their roots and upturns . . . Then what energy does the strongest possess?'</p><p>"'The very strongest? That is He. I cannot fully comprehend the power of His energy.'</p><p>"'What about an average one?'</p><p>"'The energy set of many average spirits already includes liberated thought energy.'</p><p>"'What is the energy power and potential of this average set?'</p><p>"'I've told you. Present within it is liberated thought energy.'</p><p>"'Meaning what? What can you compare it to? How do you define it?'</p><p>"'Compare? Define? Your mind, your thought, the awareness of what is most powerful —what kind of energy might they suggest?'</p><p>"'The energy of a nuclear explosion. No, the processes taking place on the Sun.'</p><p>"'Everything you have named is equal to just a small particle of liberated thought energy. As for definitions, think them up yourselves and use them to communicate with each other. Here nothing you have thought up is suitable. You may use what you know, multiplied infinitely.'</p><p>"'What is the strength of the energy of your foremother's spirit like?'</p><p>"'Present in it is liberated thought energy.'</p><p>"'How did you find out about your foremother? How and where did she die? After all, this happened ten thousand years ago!'</p><p>"'Generations of my ancestors have passed down the information about her, my foremother, who went to die in a dolmen.'</p><p>"'Your mother told you about her?'</p><p>"'When my dear mama died, I was little and incapable of comprehending that kind of information. My grandfather and great-grandfather told me everything about my dear mamas.'</p><p>"'Can the spirit be seen with ordinary human vision?'</p><p>"'Partially, yes. If the perception of spectrality, vision's color perception, is altered, if the internal rhythm is altered.'</p><p>"'This is really possible?'</p><p>"'Daltonism, a phenomenon you know, suggests that it is. You believe that this occurs only apart from the person's will—that it is merely a disease—but that is not so.'</p><p>"'You said your foremother and your mother are worthy of having information about them passed down from generation to generation through the millennia. Where does the worthiness and value of this information lie?'</p><p>"'My foremother was the last of the primary sources to have the capability and to know how and what a woman should think about when she was nursing her infant—knowledge of people who lived ten thousand years ago, which began to be lost in civilization. This knowledge has been almost entirely lost today. My foremother was not at all old, but she went to die in the dolmen in order to preserve all this knowledge of the primary sources. When comprehension begins to return to people, when the need arises in them to transmit this knowledge to nursing women, they will later help each other know everything. Through her death in the dolmen, my foremother learned even more truths essential to women.'</p><p>"'Why did she go into a dolmen specifically? How does a dolmen differ from an ordinary stone tomb? Why, without waiting for old age, did she decide to die in a dolmen? Was she moved by an understanding of her purpose or by superstition?'</p><p>"'At that time people had already begun putting less and less importance on nursing infants, and women were not offered the dolmens at their request. The old leader respected my foremother and understood that if he did not carry out her request, the new leader would not even want to listen to my foremother and would consider all her intentions mere whim. But the old leader could not force the men to build a dolmen for her. That is when the old leader gave his own dolmen to her. The men did not approve the leader's decision and refused to raise the dolmen's roof so that she could enter. The women assembled and all night tried to lift the heavy stone slab themselves, but the slab weighed many tons and at dawn the old leader came. He could no longer walk, but he came anyway, leaning on his staff. The old leader smiled at the women, said encouraging words, and the women lifted the heavy slab and my foremother entered the dolmen.'</p><p>"'How does a dolmen differ from an ordinary stone tomb?'</p><p>"'Very little, outwardly. However, living people went to die in the dolmens, as you call the stone tomb. A dolmen is not simply a cult structure made of stone, as is now thought, but a monument to wisdom and to the great self-sacrifice of the spirit for the sake of future generations. Even today, it is important for its functional significance. Death in that kind of dolmen was not quite ordinary. The word "death" does not even fit very well here.'</p><p>"'I can imagine. A living person immured in a stone chamber—truly an unusually tortuous death.'</p><p>"'The people who went into the dolmens were not tortured at all. The peculiarity of their death was that they meditated. They meditated into eternity, remaining on Earth in spirit forever, having preserved certain earthly feelings. But the soul of someone who went into a dolmen to die loses for eternity the possibility of material incarnation on Earth.'</p><p>"'How did they meditate?'</p><p>"'You now know what meditation is, especially from the ancient Eastern religions. Today there are teachings helping us to learn a small part of the phenomena of meditation, but unfortunately not its purpose. Right now there are people who can meditate, separate a part of their spirit from their body for a while and then return it. With the help of meditation in the dolmen, still during the body's life, the spirit completely detached and returned many times, as long as the flesh was alive. Then the spirit remained in the dolmen for eternity. Alone, it waits eternally for visitors, in order to impart the wisdom of the primary sources to them. The flesh, even if it could live for a while, was in any case confined. But while my foremother was alive, her spirit had the opportunity to be in different dimensions and to return, and this gave it the opportunity to analyze with a speed incredible by your lights, to hone the available truth. The people who died or went into eternal meditation through the dolmen knew that their soul and spirit would never be able to materialize again. They could never settle in any earthly flesh or matter. They could never go far from the dolmen for too long or too often, but in compensation, they had the ability to interact with a particle of the soul of someone who had come to the dolmen in the flesh. If you talk about the agonies of death and agonies in general, in this case they consisted of the fact that for millennia no one approached them to accept this knowledge. Their great tragedy lies in the absence of demand. Demand for the sake of which—'</p><p>"'Anastasia, do you believe that it's important for a mother nursing her infant to have this knowledge and ability?'</p><p>"'Very important.'</p><p>"'Why? After all, the mother's milk merely nourishes the infant's flesh.'</p><p>"'Not only his flesh. Her milk can bear enormous information and sensitivity. After all, you have to know that each substance has its own information, emanation, vibration.'</p><p>"Yes, it does. But how can mother's milk transmit sensitivity?'</p><p>"'It can. It is very sensitive. It is indissolubly linked with the mother's feelings. Even the taste of the milk changes depending on them. During stress that affects the nursing mother, breast milk can also be lost, or clot.'</p><p>"'Yes, it truly can. So no one visits your foremother? No one has visited for many millennia?'</p><p>"'At first they did. Primarily generations of my relatives and the people who lived there. Then disasters began to strike the earth. Migrations. The dolmen remained. But for the last few millennia, no one has gone to my foremother's dolmen to learn. The dolmens in general are being destroyed right now, because people don't know.</p><p>"'When I was telling Vladimir in the taiga about the dolmens and my foremother, he said he might go to her dolmen. At the time, I explained to him that he would not be able to understand and sense my foremother's spirit and soul and take in her information. A man cannot know the feelings and sensations of a nursing mother. Also, my foremother has been waiting for women, not men, for millennia. But women are not going to the dolmen, and only I communicate with my foremother once a year. On that day, I wanted to communicate with her, to tell her something good, but I couldn't. My foremother's spirit was not by the dolmen, and I myself, not understanding why, quickly began guiding my ray around the dolmen, steadily increasing the diameter of my circles. And all of a sudden, I saw it. I saw it! In a small gorge, on the rocks, Vladimir lay on the stones unconscious, and my foremother, her spirit, was leaning over Vladimir as a bundle of invisible energies. I understood. I had known even before how Vladimir had looked for guides to go into the mountains to the dolmens far from the road but had not found any guides. No one would agree to go with him for free. So Vladimir went into the mountains alone. He fell off the path into a gorge. He was wearing ordinary shoes, unfit for hiking through the mountains. He had no mountain gear at all. He wanted to be convinced of the dolmens' existence, to touch them. So he went into the mountains alone. On my foremother's memorial day, he was walking toward dolmens far from the roads. My foremother did not know why this man, who was completely unequipped for hiking mountain paths, was walking in the mountains. She was watching him, and when he slipped, when he fell off and started rolling downhill, her spirit raced down like an elastic bundle of air.</p><p>"'My foremother saved Vladimir. He did not hit his head on a rock, but he lost consciousness from the blows he received as he rolled down.</p><p>"'She held his head with her elastic bundle of air, as if in her hands, and waited for him to regain consciousness. That was why she had not spoken with me.</p><p>"'When Vladimir regained consciousness, she did not return to her dolmen. She remained below, in the gorge, to watch Vladimir scramble up to the path.</p><p>"'Later I realized that my foremother was on the path because pebbles had started skittering down from the path. It was she, contracting like an elastic breeze, who had been throwing pebbles from the mountain path. She had wanted to help Vladimir descend from the mountain along the path. I too wanted this very much, and I began very quickly to run my ray along the path so the path would not be so wet and slippery and so that Vladimir would be able to reach his little apartment and treat his wounds. But when Vladimir climbed up from the gorge, he sat on the path examining the sketch drawn for him by an archeologist at the Novorossiisk museum. Then he got up and started off, limping—not down, though, along the dry and now pebble-free path, but in the opposite direction: up. I froze in surprise, and I do not think my foremother immediately understood his intentions. He immediately veered from the path altogether and climbed through thorny bushes. I realized that he was climbing to my foremother's dolmen. He reached it. He sat down at the dolmen's portal, at the edge of the stone slab. He started unbuttoning his jacket. His hand hurt. It took him a long time to unbutton his jacket. When he did I saw . . . he had flowers under his jacket. Three little roses. The stems of two had snapped. The roses had broken when he slid into the gorge and struck the stones. A few thorns were bloody. He placed the broken roses at the dolmen's portal. He lit a cigarette and said, "It's too bad the flowers broke. This is for you, my beauty, flowers. You must have been a beauty, like Anastasia. Smart and good. You wanted to tell our women about nursing their infants. But they don't know about you, and your dolmen lies so far from the road, it's hard for women to reach it."</p><p>"'Then Vladimir got out a pocket flask of brandy and two small metal cups and took a handful of crushed candies out of his pocket. Vladimir filled the cups with brandy. He drank the brandy from one cup and set the other on the dolmen's portal and put a candy on it and said, "This is for you, my beauty."</p><p>"'Vladimir did everything the way modern people do at a cemetery when they visit their close relatives or friends, but my foremother's spirit raced around him in a bundle of invisible energies. She was distraught and did not know how to behave. She was trying to respond somehow to what Vladimir had said and to solidify the air in the form of her own flesh, but her outline was transparent and barely perceptible. Vladimir did not notice it. She kept trying to explain something to him, though he could neither see nor hear her, and so she raced around. The bundle of air skimmed the little cup. The cup overturned. Vladimir thought it was a chance breeze that had overturned the cup of brandy and he joked, saying, "Why did you spill this expensive brandy, you good-for-nothing woman?"</p><p>"'My foremother's spirit suddenly fell still in a corner of the dolmen. Vladimir poured more brandy into her cup, set a stone on top, and then another candy. Once again, as if to himself, he began to speak. "They should at least lay a decent path to your dolmen. You just wait a little longer. There should at least be a path to your dolmen, then women will take that path to see you. You'll tell them what they need to think about when they're nursing their infant. You must have had a very beautiful breast."</p><p>"'Then Vladimir began his descent. Late that night, he arrived at his apartment. He was sitting alone on his sofa in the cold apartment, binding his wounds and watching a video. He had been given a video to watch that people in different cities had copied and passed around.</p><p>"'On the television screen, a large audience of mainly women listened to a speaker. He was talking about God and the power of a righteous person's spirit. Then he started talking about me, about how I was the ideal of a woman toward which one needed to strive. The power of my intellect and spirit was great and I was helped by the forces of Light. Now that I was learning more about the life of people of the ordinary world, I would be able to help them.</p><p>"'Much that was good was said about me. Suddenly, somebody said that I had yet to meet a real man, that the man I had met was not a real man. Others had also said that in Australia there was a young man worthy of me and that I would meet him, a real man.</p><p>"'While he, Vladimir, he . . . You have to understand. He was sitting alone, listening to these words all the while trying to bind the wounds on his feet with one hand. His other hand hurt badly from the battering. I rushed to Vladimir with my ray. I wanted to warm his wounds and drive out his pain. And to say . . . somehow say . . . He never hears when I speak to him at a distance, but this time I thought it might work, probably because I wanted it so badly, wanted him to hear. Hear how I loved him! Only him. And that only he, my beloved, was a real man.</p><p>"'But I was burned and thrown onto the grass. Something would not let my ray reach Vladimir. Again I sent my ray to the room where he sat in front of the television, and I saw that kneeling in front of Vladimir, a bundle of invisible energy, was the spirit of my foremother. Vladimir could not see or hear her. He was watching and listening to the video, as my foremother warmed the wounds on his legs with her breath. When Vladimir poured this horribly burning cologne on his wounds. My foremother tried to say something to him, but he did not hear her.</p><p>"'My foremother's spirit is so powerful that nothing invisible can penetrate it. Even psychotropic weapons fly apart if they are aimed at her. She ignores them. There was no way I could step in. It would all be thrown off in any case. I could only watch. I watched and thought very quickly. What had happened? Why had this situation arisen? Why had the speaker spoken this way? Did he want to help me? Clarify something? What? Why did my ray speed so toward Vladimir? Naturally, I was afraid that Vladimir would be offended by the words "not a real man" and that he would be jealous. All of a sudden . . . Oh, how painful this was . . . hurtful. Vladimir listened all the way through, sighed, and said, "Great, a real man. And in Australia, I see. They're going to meet. Maybe they'll give me my son then."</p><p>"'My ray trembled. Everything sort of clouded over. You have to understand. Vladimir was not jealous. Jealousy is a bad emotion, of course. But I wished he would be just a little, just the slightest bit jealous. But it was as if Vladimir had just handed me over to someone else. I couldn't stand it any longer, and I cried out. I begged my foremother to explain what I had done wrong. Where was my mistake? Had I sinned? She did not answer until Vladimir had bandaged up his last wound. Then my foremother said with sorrow, "You should have simply loved, my daughter. You should have thought about what was good for your beloved without glorifying yourself."</p><p>"'I tried to make her understand that I wanted only what was good. But she said again softly, "You wanted pictures, music, poems, and songs for yourself, my daughter. Everything will come to pass. Your dream is strong, I know. It is for all people and the man you love, but for you it is going to be harder and harder now to win earthly love. You are becoming a star, my daughter. A star can be admired and loved as a star, not as a woman."</p><p>"'My foremother said nothing more. I lost control, cried out, tried to explain or prove that I did not want to be a star, that I wanted simply to be a woman and loved! But no one heard me.</p><p>"'Please help me! I have understood so much now. I am not afraid for myself, I can take care of myself. It will take Vladimir longer to understand; information like this leads him away from the Truth.</p><p>"'Let the dissemination of this cassette cease. It suggests to people and to Vladimir that I am an ideal, a star, that not he but someone else should be with me.</p><p>"'I am not a star. I am a woman. I want to love the person I myself want to love.</p><p>"'My path has not been determined by me alone.</p><p>"'I was mistaken. I dreamed of making it so that people would talk about me, dedicate poems and songs to me, artists would draw. . . . And all that did happen.</p><p>"'Everything always comes true when I dream it, and so did this. Thank you for the poems and songs. Thank you to the poets. But I was mistaken. I dreamed it right. We do need poems! But I should not be a star.</p><p>"'I wanted all this so that Vladimir would see and hear it and remember—remember me. But I did not know when I was dreaming. Now I understand. I am becoming a star. Everyone admires stars. But they love simply a woman.'</p><p>"'Anastasia, what are you saying! The distribution of the cassette, especially since people themselves are copying it, can't be stopped. This is an uncontrollable process. No one can stop it.'</p><p>"'There, you see? You can't. But Vladimir—he is an entrepreneur. Maybe the process is uncontrollable. He would still have done something. But he does not want to do anything, having reconciled himself to the fact that he and I are not a match.</p><p><div class=chapter id=0306>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>6.

All space is filled with them.'</p><p>"'Can you communicate freely with them, see them?'</p><p>"'Yes, I can.'</p><p>"'Can you answer any question facing science?'</p><p>"'Many of them, perhaps, although every scientist, every person can get answers, too.

I must ask all the women who have loved and were or were not loved. They will think, analyze, and produce thoughts that will appear in the dimension of the Forces of Light. I will see them. I will understand and then help everyone. The thoughts of the dimension of Light are always understandable.'</p><p>"'Anastasia, you can't ask all women a question at once. No one can do that.'</p><p>"'Then ask Vladimir, and he will come up with a way to do it. He will undertake something. He will not think for my sake alone. You will be able to explain to him that this is very important for all people, for him. If he senses the importance, then he will definitely undertake something. He will find a way to ask all women.'</p><p>"'You believe so strongly in him. Why couldn't he love you then?'</p><p>"'Don't blame him for that. Blame me. I made many mistakes. Maybe I rushed and seemed unreal to him with my abilities. Maybe he still cannot comprehend why his son has to be raised in what seems to him unusual conditions for a human being, in the forest. Maybe I should not have hindered his usual habits so abruptly or interfered in his consciousness. Now I know that men strongly dislike that. They even beat women over this. I probably should have waited, and he himself would have understood everything. He should have felt himself to be stronger than me in at least something, but I did not grasp that in time. I said he could not see his son until he cleansed himself. At that moment I was thinking only of our son and what would be best for him, and inadvertently I said, "It is not good for our son to see his father as a half-wit." So it turned out that I was too smart for words and my beloved was stupid. What kind of reciprocated love can I dream of after that?'</p><p>"'Why didn't you ask other women then, if you yourself were capable of analyzing like that?'</p><p>"''I have to figure out whether there is a chance of fixing everything. I cannot figure it out myself. I get too agitated when I think about him. You have to analyze calmly, remember and compare. But there is nothing for me to remember but him.'</p><p>"'Can you speak with him?'</p><p>"'I think ordinary words are useless. True love does not arise out of words. Actions are needed. But what kind? Some of the women might have experience and an answer.'</p><p>"'You cannot influence him at all with your ray?'</p><p>"'Right now, I cannot even touch him with my ray. My foremother's spirit is often by his side, and she does not allow it. I understand why.'"</p><p><div class=chapter id=0307>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>7. Capture</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>"The helicopter approached the camp. We all watched in silence as it landed. The pilots who came out of the helicopter walked up to our group. The pilots began looking at Anastasia, too. A group of healthy, armed muzhiks silently watched the solitary woman wearing the old blouse standing in front of them, and everyone realized they had to capture this woman. The only issue was how to bring about the capture in the most decent way possible. Speaking after a long pause, Boris Moiseyevich set everything out straightforwardly.</p><p>"'Anastasia, you represent a definite asset for science. The decision about your relocation has already been made. This is essential, including for your own good. If, due to your failure to understand the situation, you refuse to do this voluntarily, we will be compelled to take you by force. Of course, you will want your child to be with you in the new place, too. Show us your glade on the map, and the helicopter will bring your child. Later on, we can catch some of the animals for their relocation to your new place of residence. I repeat. All this is necessary for your benefit and your son's, and for other people's as well. You do want to benefit people, don't you?'</p><p>"'Yes,' Anastasia replied calmly and immediately added, 'Everything I know, I am prepared to share everything with people if they are interested—but with all people. Science is not the legacy of everyone altogether. In the beginning, its achievements are used by local groups and often in selfish, personal interests. The majority get only what the local groups find advantageous to disseminate. Who do you represent if not a separate, local group? I cannot go with you. I need to raise someone, my son. This can be done in full where a dimension of Love has been created. This dimension has been created and perfected by my family near and far. It is still small, but through it, I am connected to everything that exists in the Universe. Each person must create his own dimension of Love around himself and give this to his child. Children should not be born criminally, without a dimension of Love having been prepared for them. Each person must create a small dimension of Love around himself, and if each person understands and does this, then the whole Earth will be a shining point of Love in the Universe. This is what He wanted, and this is man's purpose. For only man can create such a thing.'</p><p>"Two sturdy security men skirted behind Anastasia. I don't know whose signal they acted on. The head of security? Or had all this been planned in advance? They exchanged glances and simultaneously seized Anastasia by the arms. They did this fairly professionally, but also with a certain apprehension. They held her firmly by the arms, as if holding a captured bird by its spread wings. The thickset, crew-cut head of security stepped out in front next to Boris Moiseyevich. There was no expression of fear on Anastasia's face. But she was no longer looking at us. She had bowed her head a little toward the ground, and her eyelashes were lowered, hiding her gaze. She began to speak, without raising her eyes, but still calmly and with goodness in her voice.</p><p>"'Please do not use force. That is dangerous.'</p><p>"'For who?' the head of security asked hoarsely.</p><p>"'For you. And it will be unpleasant for me.'</p><p>"Trying to restrain what was either fear or excitement, Boris Moiseyevich asked, 'Can you cause us physical pain by using abilities not possessed by a human?'</p><p>"'I am a human. I am human, like all people, but I am upset. My distress might lead me to do something undesirable.'</p><p>"'What, for instance?'</p><p>"'Matter . . . cells . . . atoms . . . the atom's nucleus . . . chaotically movable particles of the nucleus. You know about them. If you imagine, see, and study them vividly and precisely, if you let your imagination remove from the nucleus just one chaotically moving particle, something happens—something happens to matter.'</p><p>"Anastasia turned her head to the side, half-raised her eyelashes, and began looking at a stone lying on the ground. The stone began to disintegrate into individual particles and quickly turned into a pile of sand. Then she raised her gaze to the head of security, a squinting, focused gaze. Steam began coming out of the tip of the security head's left ear. Slowly, millimeter by millimeter, the shell of his ear disappeared. Suddenly, a young guard standing nearby, his face pale from fear, grabbed his gun. He did this professionally, without thinking. He quickly aimed his gun at Anastasia and emptied the entire cartridge into her.</p><p>"Probably in that instant each of us was thinking very fast, and something happened that soldiers in battle know well, when in extreme conditions they have seen a moving shell or bullet. Although the shells fly at their usual speed, due to the acceleration of thought and perception, you see them flying slowly.</p><p>"I saw one bullet after another released from the pale guard's gun fly at Anastasia. The first bullet, aimed at Anastasia's head, grazed her temple. The next ones did not reach her and disintegrated to dust in flight, just like the stone Anastasia had looked at before.</p><p>"We all stood as if paralyzed. We saw blood drip slowly down Anastasia's cheek from under her scarf.</p><p>"When the shots were fired, the guards holding Anastasia's arms leaned back but did not let go of her arms. Holding her in a death grip, they pulled her in opposite directions. And all of a sudden a blue illumination began to spread over the ground around us. It was coming from somewhere above and intensifying rapidly. It cast a spell over us and would not let us move or speak. In the unusual, ensuing silence, we heard Anastasia's words.</p><p>"'Please let go of my arms. I might not make it in time. Please let go.'</p><p>"But the guards, as if paralyzed, continued to hold her in a death grip. Now I understand why she raised her arm in that characteristic gesture when she was with you. This is how she showed someone up above that she was all right and no help was required. But this time they wouldn't let Anastasia raise her arm.</p><p>"The blue illumination kept intensifying, and then something seemed to flash and we saw—hanging above us, pulsing with blue light —a fiery sphere. It looked like ball lightning, but bigger. Inside it lots of lightning bolts flashed and twisted together. Sometimes, breaking out of the blue sheathing, they touched the tops of trees standing far away and the flowers at our feet, but did them no harm. For an instant, one of the slender lightning-rays touched an obstruction in the stream formed by a rock and a fallen tree. The obstruction immediately turned into a cloud and evaporated.</p><p>"The rays breaking out of the fiery sphere's blue sheathing must have possessed the tremendous power of an energy unknown to us. It was controlled by some kind of intellect.</p><p>"We felt the close presence of an intelligent being possessing incomprehensible power, but what was most incredible and unnatural for the given situation were our sensations from its presence. Neither fear nor even caution settled in us. On the contrary. . . .</p><p>"Just imagine, in that situation we began to feel peace and grace, as if something near and dear had appeared beside us.</p><p>"The pulsating blue sphere hovered over us as if studying and assessing the situation. Suddenly it described a circle in the air and landed at Anastasia's feet. The blue illumination intensified and, like a beneficial languor, relaxed us so much that we didn't feel like moving, listening to anything, or speaking.</p><p>"The sphere's blue sheathing let several fiery lightning bolts through at once. They sped toward Anastasia and began to touch her bare feet, as if stroking her toes.</p><p>"Anastasia freed her arms from the relaxed guards and reached out to the sphere. It immediately moved up to the level of her face, and the fiery bolts, which had turned the stones in the stream to dust, began touching her arms without causing them harm.</p><p>"Anastasia began to speak to the sphere. We couldn't hear what she said, but judging from her gestures and the expression on her face, she was trying to explain or prove something to it, to convince it of something—to no avail. The sphere wouldn't answer her, and still it was clear that it didn't agree with her. This was clear because Anastasia kept trying to convince it with more and more agitation. It must have been her agitation that made her cheeks flush, and still talking, she removed her scarf. Wheaten-gold locks of hair covered Anastasia's shoulders and the streak of dried blood on her face. We saw how beautiful and perfect the features of her face were. The sphere of the fiery comet flew around Anastasia a few times and stopped by her face again. Thousands of fine lightning bolts sped toward her golden hair and precisely touched and lifted each hair individually, as if caressing them. One of the rays lifted an entire lock of hair at once and revealed the bullet wound on Anastasia's temple while another ray slowly slid down the trace of caked blood. With the actions of its fiery rays rather than words, the sphere seemed to be reminding her of what had happened and would not agree with her arguments. It gathered up all its rays inside itself, and Anastasia lowered her head and fell silent. The sphere flew around Anastasia once more and zoomed up. The blue illumination grew fainter, and we returned to our former condition. However, instead of blue light, brown smoke rose from the earth. This smoke filled the entire space around us, and only Anastasia remained in a small blue circle. When the brown smoke had enveloped us fully, we knew what hell was.</p><p><div class=chapter id=0308>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>8. What Hell Is</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>"The pictures in Bibles depicting sinners' bestial torments in frying pans, even the most awful plots from outrageous videos, would seem like children's naïve fairytales compared to what happened to us.</p><p>"In the entire history of humanity, no one could picture or fantasize anything like it.</p><p>"In all the Bible stories and horror-movie renderings, the human fantasy goes no further than showing torments of the flesh by every possible means, but this is nothing compared with real hell."</p><p>"So what could be more terrible than sophisticated torments of the flesh? What hell did you see?"</p><p>"When the blue illumination weakened enough for the brown smoke to rise from the earth and envelop us from head to foot, we found ourselves split in two."</p><p>"Two what?"</p><p>"Imagine. . . . I suddenly consisted of two component parts. The first part was my body sheathed in transparent skin through which I could see all my internal organs, my heart, stomach, intestines, the blood running through my veins, and the various other organs. The second—invisible—part consisted of my feelings, emotions, reason, desires, and pains—basically everything invisible in a person."</p><p>"What difference does it make whether these parts are together or separate if it's still you? What happened to you that was so terrible, if you don't count the transparency of your skin?"</p><p>"The difference turned out to be incredibly important. The whole point is that our bodies began acting independently of our reason, will, aspirations, and desires. We could observe our bodies' actions from the side, while our emotions and pains remained in us, invisible, but we had lost the possibility of influencing our own bodies' actions."</p><p>"Like someone dead drunk?"</p><p>"Drunk people don't see themselves from the outside—at least at the moment of intoxication—but we saw and felt everything. The acuity of our awareness was incredibly precise. I saw how beautiful the grass, flowers, and river were. I heard the birds singing and the creek gurgling, felt the air's purity around me and the warmth of the sun's rays. But our bodies . . . The transparent bodies of everyone standing in our group suddenly trooped toward the backwater in the stream at a run.</p><p>"The backwater looked like a tiny lake, the water in it was clean and clear, and on the bottom there was sand, pretty stones, and tiny little fish swimming. Our bodies ran toward the beautiful little lake and began splashing it. Then they defecated in it, and urinated.</p><p>"The water became cloudy and dirty, but they drank it. I saw the dirty, foul-smelling liquid flow into my stomach and through the bowels of my body. I was gripped by nausea and disgust. Right then, next to the body of water, under a tree, there appeared the naked bodies of two women. Their skin was just as transparent as that of our bodies.</p><p>"On the grass under the tree, the women's bodies lay, basking and stretching in the sun. The security chief's body and mine ran up to the women.</p><p>"My body caressed the woman's, received reciprocal caresses from it, and began to have sex with it. The security chief's body could not get his woman to consent and began to rape her. The body of one of the guards ran up to us and struck mine with a rock in the back and then the head. He beat my body, but it was the invisible me who experienced unbearable pain. The guard dragged my body by the feet off the woman's and began raping it himself. Our bodies quickly aged and withered. Time seemed to speed events up. The just-raped woman became pregnant, and through her transparent skin I could see the fruit conceive in her womb and grow in size.</p><p>"The body of the scientist, Boris Moiseyevich, went up to the pregnant woman, examined the growing fruit carefully through the transparent skin for a little while, and then suddenly thrust his hand into the woman's vagina and began to rip the fetus out of her. Meanwhile, Stanislav's body quickly dragged stones to a single pile, chopped down small trees like a maniac, and from all this built something like a little house with whatever came to hand. My body started helping him. When the little house was almost built, my body started driving Stanislav's body out. He resisted, and our bodies began to fight.</p><p>"The invisible me experienced terrible pain when he punched me in the legs and head. Our fight drew the attention of the other bodies. First, they tossed us both out of the little house, and then they themselves fought over it among themselves. My body had grown decrepit and began to fall apart and rot before me. It could no longer move, and under a bush, it lay, emitting a nauseating stench. Worms appeared on it. I felt them crawl over me, pierce my internal organs, and eat them. I could clearly feel them gnawing my innards, and I waited for my body's final disintegration to deliver me from these excruciating agonies.</p><p>"Suddenly, from the second raped woman, the fruit fell out and it began growing before my eyes. The baby stood up, took his first timid step, and a second, tottered, and plopped down on his bottom. I felt the sensations of pain from his fall and realized, horrified, that this was my new body and he would have to live among these loathsome, mindless bodies that fouled themselves and everything around them.</p><p>"I realized that the invisible me would never die and I would eternally perceive and comprehend with full clarity the abomination of what was happening, I would experience physical and even more terrible pain.</p><p>"The same thing was happening to the other bodies. They were growing decrepit, disintegrating and being born anew, and with each new birth, our bodies merely exchanged roles.</p><p>"Almost no vegetation remained around us. In its place rose ugly buildings, and the previously clean backwater turned into a stinking puddle."</p><p>Alexander fell silent. What he had said aroused disgust in me, but not pity.</p><p>I told him, "Of course, you've suffered through a horror, but it serves you vipers right. Why did you pester Anastasia? She lives as a hermit in the taiga. She doesn't bother anyone. She doesn't need housing, pensions, or subsidies. Why trouble her?"</p><p>Outwardly Alexander did not take offense at what I had said to him. He sighed, and replied.</p><p>"You just said, 'suffered through a horror.' The thing is that . . . It's incredible, but the thing is that I'm not entirely through it. I don't think the others from our group are either."</p><p>"What does that mean, 'not entirely'? You're sitting here calmly now, stirring the fire with a stick."</p><p>"Yes, of course I am, I'm stirring, but the clarity of my awareness—the awareness of something terrible—has remained. It's inside me. It frightens me. It's frightening, but not in the past. It's happening to us today, right now, to all of us."</p><p>"To you, maybe, something is happening, but for me and the others everything's fine."</p><p>"Doesn't it seem to you, Vladimir, that what we went through is an exact copy of what humanity is creating today? What we were shown in fast-forward and miniature merely portrayed our present-day actions."</p><p>"Not to me. Our skin isn't transparent, and our bodies obey us."</p><p>"Perhaps someone is simply sparing us, not letting us fully realize or see everything we have already created and continue to create. After all, if we did realize, if we did take a detached view of our lives, if we did see life unclouded by all the false dogmas serving to justify what we created yesterday and today, we wouldn't be able to stand it. We'd lose our minds.</p><p>"Outwardly, we all try to look proper, but we're trying to justify the evil we create by our own supposedly insurmountable weakness. I could not resist temptation, I smoked, I drank, I killed, I started a war in defense of certain ideals, I detonated a bomb.</p><p>"We are weak. This is what we believe ourselves to be now. There are higher powers, and they can do and solve everything. And us? We, hiding behind our dogmas, can create any abomination we like.</p><p>"Indeed, we are the ones—each of us—creating an abomination, only we justify ourselves to ourselves in different ways. It's absolutely clear to me now, as long as my consciousness does not lose the ability to guide my flesh, that I and I alone must answer for all its actions. Anastasia is right when she says, 'As long as man is in the flesh . . .'"</p><p>"Don't you go quoting Anastasia. All I need is another wise guy. She's right! But you yourselves nearly put her in her grave. It's too bad she didn't show you something more and make you all flip your lids."</p><p>More and more fury at this group had been building up inside me, but as long as I was face to face with Alexander, I displaced my fury onto him.</p><p>"Take a look at yourself," Alexander replied. "Isn't it thanks to you that we were able to find Anastasia? And not only us? Do you really believe that attempts like ours won't be repeated?</p><p>"Why did you need to indicate without any alteration the name of the ship you took down the river and also the captain's name? That's all we needed, a documentarian. You might have changed the name of the river, but you didn't, you didn't have the wit at the time. But you're demanding wit from others. I got what I deserved, and now I'll have to spend my whole life making sense of the nightmare I witnessed."</p><p>"How did your nightmare end? How did you escape from it?"</p><p>"We could never have rid ourselves of it. It was designed for us for eternity. At least that's the feeling each of us had.</p><p>"Anastasia appeared among our disintegrating but still-functioning bodies, and her skin was not transparent. She was wearing her old blouse and long skirt as before, and she started saying something to our bodies but they weren't obeying. It was as if they were preprogrammed, dying and being born anew, to keep repeating their actions, merely switching roles.</p><p>"Then Anastasia began quickly picking up the garbage around one of the structures erected by our bodies. She quickly raked the scattered stones and brush into a pile with her hands, loosened the earth a little with a stick, touched it, ruffled the trampled grass, and began setting the green blades of grass aright—not all of them, but those that could still stand. Anastasia gently straightened the broken trunk of a small sapling, about a meter high. She kneaded the damp earth in her hands and smeared the broken place with it and, grasping it in her hands, held it for a while, then cautiously let go, and the sapling's trunk was straight.</p><p>"Anastasia nimbly continued with this work. On the earth our bodies had trampled, which had lost almost all its vegetation, the small oasis she had created grew larger. Boris Moiseyevich's body ran over to it, jumped on the grass, stretched out on it, jumped up, and ran away, and a little later returned with the body of one of the guards. Together, they tore out the small sapling and started to drag sticks and stones to the green grass, to build another ugly structure.</p><p>"Anastasia threw up her hands and tried to say something to them, but when she saw that no one paid any attention to what she said, she fell silent. For a while she stood there, distraught, arms at her sides, and then dropped to her knees and covered her face with her hands, and the hair on her shoulders trembled. Anastasia was weeping, like a child.</p><p>"Almost immediately, a barely noticeable blue illumination appeared, and it again drove the brown fumes of our hell into the earth, and our flesh united with our invisible self. Only we couldn't move as before, not from horror but from the blissful languor imparted by the blue illumination. Above us in the sky, describing circles, the fiery sphere shone once again.</p><p>"Anastasia reached out to it, and the sphere, shifting instantly, was a meter from her face. She spoke to it, and this time I heard what she said.</p><p>"She said, 'Thank you. You are good. Thank you for your mercy and love. People will understand. They have to understand everything and feel it with their heart. Never take your blue light—your light of love—from the Earth.'</p><p>"Anastasia smiled, and a teardrop ran down her cheek. Fiery lightning-rays rushed through the sphere's blue sheathing and toward Anastasia's face. They deftly and cautiously removed the teardrop glittering in the sun, and carefully, as if it were a jewel, the suddenly trembling rays bore the precious teardrop away on their tips. They carried the teardrop inside the sphere. The sphere shuddered, described a circle around Anastasia, dropped to the ground at her feet, shot up, and dissolved in the sky's blue, leaving everything on the ground as it had been. We were still standing in place, as before. The sun was shining, and the river flowed as before. The forest could be seen in the distance, and Anastasia stood in front of us, as before. We silently perceived everything around us, and I rejoiced at seeing it all. I think the others did, too. However, we remained silent, perhaps due to what we'd been through or to the beauty we suddenly saw around us."</p><p>Alexander stopped speaking, as if he had withdrawn entirely, and I started talking to him.</p><p>"Listen, Alexander, perhaps nothing like what you told me about actually happened to you. Might Anastasia simply have had you under powerful hypnosis? I've read that lots of hermits know how to hypnotize. Perhaps she too had you hypnotized and showed you a vision."</p><p>"Hypnosis, you say. Did you see my gray hairs?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"This gray hair appeared after that time."</p><p>"Understandably. You were frightened under hypnosis."</p><p>"If you assume it was hypnosis, then you have to explain something else puzzling."</p><p>"What exactly?"</p><p>"The obstruction of stones and trees in the stream. The obstruction in the stream vanished. It was gone. The stream flowed freely. But that jam-up was there before our vision. Everyone saw it. It was there."</p><p>"Yes. So that's how it is. . . ."</p><p>"Not only that, but what difference does it make what happened to us? Something else is more important. I cannot be what I was before. I don't know how I'm supposed to live, what I should study now or where. When I got home, I burned a lot of books by various wise men and teachers from various countries. I had a big library."</p><p>"There was no reason for you to do that. You should have sold them if you didn't need them."</p><p>"I couldn't sell them. Such a thing never even occurred to me. I have my own scores to settle now with those wise men and teachers."</p><p>"What do you think, Alexander? Isn't it dangerous to be around Anastasia? She might really be some kind of anomaly. In their letters some people say she is a representative of another civilization. If that's true, it's dangerous to interact with her, because we don't know what that other civilization has in mind."</p><p>"I'm convinced of the exact opposite. She feels and loves the Earth so much and everything that grows and lives on it, that, compared to Anastasia, we are the ones who look like stray aliens."</p><p>"So who is she then? Can scientists finally pronounce definitively? Why does she have such a huge amount of information? How does it even fit in her head? Where do her inexplicable abilities and her ray come from?"</p><p>"I think that here we have to take her at her word: 'I am a human being, a woman.' I surmise that she does not retain any information at all in her head. More than likely, the purity of her intentions allows her to access the Universe's database, and her abilities derive from her perfect supply of information.</p><p>"The Universe loves her and fears us, and that's why it doesn't reveal itself to us in full. Our thought, the thought of modern man raised in modern society, has been blocked by stereotypes and conventions.</p><p>"She is entirely free. This is what makes it hard for us to understand that the mystery's solution may hide in the fact that she is a human being. Of course, she can create incredible wonders, by our lights, I myself have been convinced of that. During our visit, one more event occurred that you couldn't call anything but a miracle —even more mysterious than what happened our group. More sublime!"</p><p>Alexander uttered those last words with a certain agitation. He rose and stepped away from the fire into the night. In the twinkling of the starry sky and the dull light of the dying fire, I could see the young Siberian pacing back and forth. His brief, agitated phrases reached me. Alexander was saying something incomprehensible about science, psychologists, and certain teachings. I was tired of sitting and listening to his fragmentary and, for that reason, incomprehensible ramblings. I wanted to find out quickly the sublime thing, he believed, Anastasia had done before his very eyes.</p><p>I tried to reassure him.</p><p>"Alexander, you have to calm yourself. Take a seat. Tell me specifically what sublime thing happened there before your very eyes?"</p><p>He sat back down by the fire and tossed dry twigs into it, but I could tell he wasn't completely calm. Likely out of his inner unrest, he took a stick to the dying coals so abruptly that sparks flew up like fireworks and fell on us both, forcing us to jump back from the fire. After the sparks subsided, I heard his story.</p><p>"In some twenty minutes, Anastasia changed the physical condition of a little village girl, right before our eyes. She changed her before our very eyes. And also, in that time, Anastasia changed the fate of that girl and of the girl's mother and altered even the outward appearance of the abandoned taiga village. All this in some twenty minutes. The most important thing is how she did this! Incredibly simply! She . . .</p><p>"Just go and believe in horoscopes after that. I saw it. This is why I burned the books with the pretentious gibberish and various spiritual lamentations."</p><p>"There, you see? You yourself say she creates superhuman, mystical miracles, even if she does reverse horoscopes. She performs miracles, but she wants to be called a normal human being. She might try to adjust to normalcy, but no.</p><p>"I told her, too, Behave like everyone else, and everything will be fine. But she apparently cannot be like everyone else. It's too bad. As it is, she is a beautiful, good woman, smart. She can heal people. She bore me a son. But living with her as you would with anyone else is impossible. I can't even imagine how someone could sleep with her after all I've heard. No one could. Everyone needs women who are simpler, not so unfathomable. But she herself is to blame, with her mysticism."</p><p>"Wait a minute, Vladimir. I'm going to tell you something else now. Only you have to listen carefully to what I'm going to say. It's incredible, but you have to try to understand. Everyone has to! Everyone! Maybe we can understand it together.</p><p>"You see, Anastasia performed an incredible miracle with the girl, but in doing so she didn't use any kind of mysticism or potions. No sorcery, no shamanistic passes. She, Anastasia—just think about this—she performed this miracle by using only simple human words we all know. Simple ordinary words, but spoken at the right place and time.</p><p>"If psychologists were to analyze her dialog with this village girl, they would be able to understand how psychologically effective it was. Anyone uttering these words could achieve a similar effect. But for just these words to come to mind at the right moment takes the very sincerity and purity of intentions that Anastasia talks about."</p><p>"You mean we can't just memorize these words?"</p><p>"We've known them for a long time. The issue lies elsewhere. The issue is what's hidden behind each word of ours."</p><p>"You're not making sense. Why don't you tell me what else happened to you there? What words can change a person's physical condition and destiny?"</p><p>"Yes. Of course, I need to tell you. Listen."</p><p><div class=chapter id=0309>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>9. When Words Change Destinies</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>"Our group gradually recovered from what it had been through. No one spoke to anyone. We stood where we were and only after a little while started looking around, taking in the external world differently somehow, as if sensing it for the first time. Right then we saw a group of villagers coming toward us from the direction of their little houses. They were very few, about twelve—all of them old, some quite incapacitated—the entire population of this abandoned, six-household taiga village. One old woman, bent in half, leaning on a stick, hobbled but still advanced. Those who could walk without a stick held various implements—a yoke, a hoe. It was clear they were coming to defend Anastasia. The old and crippled were coming against young and healthy armed muzhiks. They came without fear and with the firm intention of defending Anastasia, no matter whom they faced.</p><p>"Their determination was frightening. When they got close to us, the old man walking slightly in front, wearing rubber boots and carrying a hoe, stopped, and the group formed up behind him. They ignored us, as if we weren't there. The old man slowly stroked his beard and, looking at Anastasia, spoke deferentially,</p><p>"'A good day to you, dearest Anastasia, from all of us.'</p><p>"'And a good day to you, good people,' Anastasia replied, pressing her hand to her chest and bowing to the old people.</p><p>"'The water in the river is leaving early nowadays,' the old man continued. 'The summer nowadays is without rain.'</p><p>"'It is without rain,' Anastasia confirmed, 'but a little more rain will come, and the river will fill and regain its former strength.'</p><p>"While they talked, a skinny, jaundiced girl of about six stepped out from the group of old people. The girl wore an old jacket refashioned from some more grownup item of clothing, patched stockings on her thin legs, and very old boots.</p><p>"Later, I learned that the girl's name was Anyuta. Sickly, with a congenital heart defect, at six months old she had been brought here from the city by her mother, who left her with the old people and had not shown her face since. People said she worked somewhere as a painter on a construction site.</p><p>"Anyuta walked up to Anastasia, began tugging at the hem of her skirt, and repeated over and over, 'Bend down, Auntie Anastasia. Bend down low.'</p><p>"Anastasia looked at the little girl and squatted in front of her. The little girl quickly removed the old white scarf from her head. She wet the edge of it and began cautiously wiping the now-dried blood on Anastasia's face and temple, all the while saying, 'You still haven't come to sit on your little log on the bank, Auntie Anastasia. My grandfather said you used to come more often. You sat on the little log and looked at the river. Now you don't come. My grandfather showed me the log where you used to sit, Auntie Anastasia. My grandfather showed me, and now I go there, to your little log, myself. I sat there alone and waited for you to come, Auntie Anastasia. I wanted to look at you so much. I have a secret for you. But you never come to your little log to sit and look at the nice river. Maybe because the log's so old? I asked and asked my grandfather, and he dragged over a new little log. There it is, lying next to the old one.'</p><p>"The little girl took Anastasia's hand and started pulling her toward the log.</p><p>"'Let's go, let's go, Auntie Anastasia, let's sit on the nice new log. My grandfather chopped out two little seats in it with his ax. I was the one who asked him to, so when you came we could sit side by side.'</p><p>"Anastasia immediately granted the little girl's request, and they sat down next to each other on the log.</p><p>"For a while they sat there quietly, paying no attention to anyone, as if there were no one else there. Everyone stood, neither speaking nor stirring. The little girl began.</p><p>"'My grandmother's told me a lot about you, Auntie Anastasia. When she died, I started asking my grandfather. He told me stories about you, too. When my grandfather tells me stories, I think about my secret for you. My grandfather used to tell me that when I was little, my heart wasn't much good. It beat unevenly. One time it started beating very unevenly. Then they brought the doctor lady in a boat. The doctor lady said, "Nothing can be done with such a bad heart. It won't listen to anyone, and soon it will die altogether."</p><p>"'My grandfather used to tell me how you sat on your old log then, too, Auntie Anastasia, and looked at the river. Then you stood up and went into our hut. You picked me up in your arms and laid me down on the grass in our yard, and you lay down next to me and put your hand on my little chest. You put it right here, where you can feel my little heart beating. Right here.' And the little girl pressed her own little hand on the left side of her skinny chest. 'My grandfather said that you lay with me, lifeless, Auntie Anastasia, because your heart started beating very softly, like mine was beating. Then yours started beating faster and it called on mine to follow. My little heart listened, and together we started beating the way we should. That's what my grandfather used to tell me. Did he tell me right? Did he, Auntie Anastasia?'</p><p>"'Yes, Anyuta. Your grandfather told you right. Now your little heart will always be good.'</p><p>"'You mean your heart called and mine obeyed? It did, right?'</p><p>"'Yes, Anyuta, your heart obeyed.'</p><p>"'Now I'll tell you my secret, Auntie Anastasia. A very important secret. Very!'</p><p>"'Please tell me your important secret, Anyuta.'</p><p>"Anyuta rose from the log and stood facing Anastasia, pressing her thin arms to her chest. Suddenly, she fell to her knees before Anastasia and in a little voice tight with distress, said, 'Auntie Anastasia, dear Auntie Anastasia, ask your heart! Ask it! Let your heart call to my mama's heart. Let my mama come to me, even for just one day. That's my secret. Let your heart . . . mama's . . . heart. . . .'</p><p>"Anyuta choked from agitation and fell silent, her eyes riveted to Anastasia.</p><p>"Anastasia squinted into the distance, past the kneeling little girl. Then she once again looked at her and replied calmly and factually, which had to horrify the child. She replied as if to an adult.</p><p>
"'Anyuta, my heart cannot summon your mama. Your mama is far away in the city. She tried to find happiness and did not find it. She does not have her own home. She does not have any money for presents for you, and she does not want to come empty-handed. It is hard for her in the city, but if she ever comes to see you, it will be even harder for her. Seeing you will be a bitter and agonizing torment for her. It will become harder and more terrible for her to live because she will see you sick and poorly dressed. She will see the houses falling down in your village and how dilapidated and dirty the house is where you live. It will be even harder for your mama because she no longer believes in the possibility of doing anything good for you. She does not. She believes she has experienced everything and this fate was destined for her. She has surrendered to a despair she herself gave birth to.'</p><p>"Little Anyuta listened to the terrible truth and her skinny little body trembled.</p><p>"It seemed incredibly cruel to say such a thing to a child. Surely a lie was more appropriate and wanted here. Pat the unfortunate girl on the head and promise her mother's speedy arrival. A happy meeting.</p><p>"But Anastasia acted differently. She told a defenseless, helpless child the full bitter truth. For a while, she watched the child's body shake and then spoke again.</p><p>"'I know you love your mama, Anyuta.'</p><p>"'I do . . . I love her. I love even my unlucky . . . my dear mama,' the child's voice, nearly breaking down in sobs, answered.</p><p>"'Then make your mama happy. You are the only one in the whole world who can make her happy. It's very simple. You get healthy and strong and learn to sing. You will be a singer. Your magnificent and pure voice will sing along with your soul. Your mama may see you in twenty years and be happy that she has. But she may also come to see you next summer. By that time, you have to be healthy and strong for her visit. Prepare presents for your mama yourself. Show her your strength and beauty. You will make your mama happy, and your meeting will be happy.'</p><p>"'But I can never be healthy. Or strong.'</p><p>"'Why?'</p><p>"'The doctor lady. She wears a white coat. The doctor lady told my grandmother. I heard what she said: "The girl will always be sickly, because she's a formula girl." I'm a formula girl. My mama couldn't nurse me. My mama's breast didn't have any milk. And when they're little, babies always drink milk from their mama's breast. I saw one lady come to the village with a little baby. I went to the house where they were visiting. I really wanted to see how little babies drink milk from their mama's teats. I tried to sit very very quietly. But they always drove me out. The mama-lady said, "Why is she looking at me like that, staring?" I was afraid to blink when I looked, because I didn't want to miss anything.'</p><p>"'Anyuta, do you think the doctor lady was right when she said you'd never be healthy and strong?'</p><p>"'How could she make a mistake? She wears a white coat. Everyone listens to her, the grandfathers and the grandmothers. She knows everything. She even knows I'm a formula girl.'</p><p>"'Why did you go to see how a baby is nursed?'</p><p>"'I thought I'd look to see how nice it is for a baby when he eats from his mama's teat. I'd see how nice it was for him and I'd feel better.'</p><p>"'You will feel better, Anyuta. You will be healthy and strong,' Anastasia said calmly and confidently. Saying this, Anastasia began slowly unbuttoning her top and bared her breast.</p><p>"As if bewitched, struck dumb with surprise, Anyuta looked at Anastasia's bared breast. Small drops of breast milk appeared at the tips of her nipples.</p><p>"'Milk. . . . Mama milk! Auntie Anastasia, are you feeding a little baby, too? Are you a mama?'</p><p>"'I am feeding my little son this milk.'</p><p>"There were more and more drops of breast milk. One drop trembled in the breeze, and the breeze shook this drop from Anastasia's breast.</p><p>"Anyuta's skinny little body tore after this drop of breast milk like a lightning-quick steel spring. Imagine! Skinny and sickly Anyuta deftly caught this drop.</p><p>"Falling to the ground, Anyuta stretched out her hands—and caught the small drop of breast milk.</p><p>"She caught it right near the ground. Anyuta got up on her knees, brought her clenched fists to her face, and opened them, examining the wet spot. Then she held her hands out to Anastasia.</p><p>"'Here. I caught it. Here it is. The milk for your little son didn't fall.'</p><p>"'You saved the drop, Anyuta. Now it is yours.'</p><p>"'Mine?'</p><p>"'Only yours.'</p><p>"Anyuta brought her open hands to her lips and tasted the wet spot. Closing her eyes, the skinny little girl held her palms pressed to her lips for a long time. Then she lowered her hands, looked at Anastasia, and in a whisper filled with gratitude, said, 'Thank you!'</p><p>"'Come to me, Anyuta.'</p><p>"Anastasia took the little girl by the shoulders. She stroked her hair and then, seating her in her lap, held her to her breast like a nursing infant and began singing softly.</p><p>"Anyuta's lips were close to the nipple of Anastasia's breast. Looking half asleep, Anyuta slowly brought her lips toward Anastasia's breast, touched the wet nipple with them, shuddered slightly, and began greedily sucking Anastasia's milk-filled breast.</p><p>"Judging from the dictaphone, she woke up ten minutes later. She raised her head and jumped from Anastasia's lap.</p><p>"'I . . . Oh! What did I do? I drank your little son's milk.'</p><p>"'Don't worry, Anyuta. He has enough. You only drank from one breast, and there is more in the other. He has enough. My little son can also eat flower pollen, if he likes. Now you have everything to keep you from being afraid of being strong, beautiful, and happy. Now take your happiness from life, from every day of it.'</p><p>"'I'll be strong and healthy. I'll think about seeing my mama, so she doesn't get upset when she sees me but is very glad. Only I won't be able to sing. My grandmother and I used to sing. My grandmother died. I keep asking my grandfather, but he doesn't sing. Only when he drinks vodka, then he sings for me, and I sing along. But it's hard to sing along with him because his voice is raspy. I've tried with the radio, too, but our old radio is staticky and I can't understand the words.'</p><p>"'Anyuta, try singing without words. When you hear the birds, echo them with your voice, and the water when it gurgles, and the rustle of the leaves and the breeze when it is strong and wails in the branches. The grass has lots of sounds, too. You will hear many pure sounds around you if you want to hear them. Try to imitate them with your voice. They will be your best teachers. I'll be going now, Anyuta. Goodbye. It's time.'</p><p>"Anastasia rose from the log. Anyuta remained sitting, listening to the world of sounds around her. Anastasia went up to the young guard who had fired at her. The guard was still pale and his hands were trembling. His gun was lying next to him on the ground.</p><p>"Anastasia told the guard, 'Do not blame yourself. Do not rack your soul. It did not take part in your actions. This is instinct. You learned to defend what you were told to without thinking about the situation. Your instinct was set in motion. It's not good if a person's instinct takes the upper hand over everything. When instinct is the main thing, then the human being is not. Then you do not have a human being. Think about it. Maybe it would be better for you to return to the human being in you.'</p><p>"The calm intonations of Anastasia's voice made the guard's hands stop trembling and the paleness disappear from his face. But when she finished speaking, the guard's face blazed red to the tips of his ears.</p><p>"Then Anastasia said goodbye to the old villagers and set off in the direction of the taiga. We silently watched Anastasia as she moved away from us. All of a sudden, we heard an extraordinarily pure child's voice.</p><p>"Anyuta, sitting on the log, was singing some very old song, probably one she had heard from her grandmother. And how she sang! Her pure voice caught incredibly high notes, entrancing and filling the spaces of the soul.</p><p>'A little rain is pouring,</p><p>And brother rocks his sister.</p><p>Brother rocks his sister.</p><p>And sings a little song.'</p><p>"Anyuta finished the song and stared at our group, which stood stock-still.</p><p>"Then Anyuta rose, picked up a slender twig, and said, 'You are bad men. So big, but still bad.'</p><p>"After saying this she came at us with the small twig in her hand. The group of old men and women followed her silently. And then all of us, every last one, began retreating. We backed up all the way to the ship anchored right at the shore and then, pushing and shoving, quickly clambered up the ramp and onto the ship. While they were getting ready to pull up the ramp, the captain suddenly saw the two helicopter pilots on board as well.</p><p>"'Where were you hiding? Whom did you abandon your helicopter to?' the captain shouted from the wheelhouse.</p><p>"The helicopter pilots leapt off the ship and ran to their equipment.</p><p>"We pulled away, leaving barrels of fuel and our tents on shore. No one gave a thought to taking them down."</p><p><div class=chapter id=0310>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>10. Create Your Own Happiness</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>When Alexander broke off his story, I couldn't help but express my distaste for him.</p><p>"Everything about you is clear to me. They left their tents and fuel. It's too bad you got off with just some gray hair. Anastasia is blessed. That was clear. Any normal person would have understood right off the bat when they saw you what you were and what you wanted. But she poured her soul out to you."</p><p>"She understood everything, why we had come and what we wanted from her. She did. But she wasn't speaking with the dark side of the human self. She ignored our dark side, interacting only with the light in each person's soul. That was how she changed us all. I'm a scientist, after all. I studied psychology."</p><p>"Great, a scientist. What good is your science if you think in hindsight?"</p><p>"Because it life often arranges events faster and more precisely. Not only that, Anastasia was . . . no, I'll avoid assigning a definition to her for now, as I would for another phenomenon."</p><p>"Such as?"</p><p>"How can I put it? . . . Do you understand? . . . Those old men and women from the abandoned taiga village—they're still coming at us. The skinny little girl with the slender twig is at their head."</p><p>"Where are they? Where are they coming?"</p><p>"At us, at everyone who was there and saw them. I thought this was happening only to me, that when I closed my eyes I saw them instantly. Sometimes they appeared as soon as I performed certain actions that they probably think are undesirable. I thought this was only happening to me, but I've spoken with the others. It's happening to everyone who was there."</p><p>"Well, that's all in your head."</p><p>"What's the difference? I still want to run from them."</p><p>"What could be so frightening about feeble, unarmed old people? What frightened you?"</p><p>"I myself still don't understand what we were frightened of. Possibly our own . . . possibly we had crossed some line."</p><p>"What kind of line? You could go crazy thinking thoughts like that. Maybe you should have thought then, when you were doing those things."</p><p>"Maybe we should have. . . . . We all need to think hard. . . ."</p><p>"Where did you get the idea that after Anastasia's conversation with the girl that the girl's fate and her mother's changed, too? And the villagers' as well?"</p><p>"I'm telling you. I used to study psychology. As a scientist, I can tell you that Anastasia completely changed Anyuta's life program.</p><p>"A sick child abandoned to the care of old people, she sat helpless in a corner of a dirty hut waiting for her mama to visit. They kept assuring her, 'Your mama will come. She'll play with you and bring you presents.' They reassured her, thinking they were doing her a good deed by lying. Meanwhile, despair had driven her mother in the city to drink. The false assurances doomed the little girl to fruitless anticipation.</p><p>"So too in our lives we frequently wait for a deus ex machina or a white knight. Someone is supposed to come and make us happy, change our fate.</p><p>"Isn't that why we act lacklusterly or not at all? Without giving much thought to the fact that we've already been given quite enough and we ourselves should be greeting whoever visits us with presents.</p><p>"Anastasia changed our fate and future with her simplicity and sincerity.</p><p>"Just think: your fate can be changed by the simplest human words.</p><p>"I've listened to the recording of Anastasia's dialog with Anyuta many times. I think if anyone else had spoken like that to the girl, it would have had the same effect. After all, it doesn't take a lot to speak the way she does. You have to not lie. You have to wish simply and sincerely to help the person—help, not sympathize. You have to be free of karmic dogmas, or rather, be stronger than them. You can argue about karma and despair, about the karmic predestination for a sick little girl. But Anastasia proved stronger than this predestination. She simply ignored it, and someone else could do the same. After all, it was all done with words—ordinary words, at that. Nevertheless, they have to be spoken at the right place and time and in a specific order. The purity of intentions Anastasia speaks of may be what automatically sets these words out in a specific order, and that may be why they're effective."</p><p>"Well, so much for your theories and conjectures. You also have to look at real life, the future, to see whether a destiny has been changed by certain words or not. And what could possibly change in life for this little girl? Unless some kind of miracle occurred."</p><p>"A miracle did occur. It turned out that all the miracles are inside us."</p><p>"What miracle occurred?"</p><p>"Little Anyuta was reprogrammed. She changed all her own karma and the karma of the people around her."</p><p>"What do you mean by 'changed'? How do you know that?"</p><p>"I know. A while later I went back to that village. I decided to bring Anyuta my radio, since hers was staticky, and install an antenna on the roof. I'm walking toward Anyuta's house over repaired wooden walkways. When we were there last, they were rotted through, but all the rotten boards had been replaced with new. 'That's great,' I thought. 'Why the improvements?' I saw Anyuta's grandfather sitting on the porch washing his boots in a bucket. I greeted him and told him why I'd come.</p><p>"'All right, then,' the old man says. 'Go on into the hut, if that's so. Only you'll have to take off your footwear. We've got new ways now, you see.'</p><p>"I took off my shoes on the porch. The old man and I entered the hut. Everything there was simple, country style, but very clean and cozy.</p><p>"'My granddaughter put things in order for us like this,' granddad told me. 'She worked hard and long. Scrubbed the floor and washed it all. More than a week, from morn 'til night, like a windup doll. She'd take a rest and go back to cleaning. She talked me into whitewashing the walls. Now, if I walk inside in boots, it leaves a track, and she picks up a rag right away and starts cleaning my tracks. Better not make them at all, those tracks. Don't have any slippers. She fixed up old galoshes instead of slippers. Put on some galoshes. Sit yourself down.'</p><p>"I sat down at the table, which was covered with an old but clean tablecloth. The tablecloth was worn in one spot, and on the worn spot, as neatly as a child's hand could, a bunny-shaped scrap of colored fabric had been sewn on. In the middle of the table stood a faceted glass in which the corners of notebook paper poked out like neat petals, instead of napkins.</p><p>"'I see you've begun to improve your little village, too. The authorities have paid you some attention, since your wooden sidewalk's been repaired,' I told granddad.</p><p>"He replied, 'It's not the authorities fitting us out. They don't care about us, the authorities. It's my granddaughter, Anyuta—she's the busy bee.'</p><p>"'What do you mean Anyuta? She's still too little to repair a sidewalk. The boards there are heavy.'</p><p>"'Heavy boards, yes. One day, I'm getting ready to go hunting one day. I ask my neighbor to keep an eye on Anyuta. But my granddaughter says, "Go on, granddad, go about your business. Don't worry. I'll take care of everything. Just let me saw the board propped up by the shed."</p><p>"'I was surprised, but I thought, let the child play, if she likes to play so much. I put the board on a log for her, gave her the saw and a hacksaw, and went hunting. My neighbor told me about it later.</p><p>"'Anyuta pulled the pieces of rotting wood out of the walkways. She measured them with a string and started sawing the board I gave her to that size. It took Anyuta half a day to saw that board, my neighbor says, but she did it. Then she dragged the board to the walkway and set it in place where the rotten one had been.'</p><p>"'How could she carry a heavy board all that way? She's so skinny and weak.'</p><p>"'She found herself a helper. Two months ago, she made friends with an orphan mutt, a Siberian husky. One old lady died at the other end of our village. Left a healthy mutt. Even at the funeral, Anyuta kept petting it. Then she brought it food to eat. At first the husky wouldn't leave its yard, though there wasn't anybody in the hut. The old lady lived alone. Anyuta fed the dog for a few days. It started following Anyuta. Now it follows her everywhere, no matter what. The old mutt helps out with all my granddaughter's whims. Here it helped drag the board. Anyuta wrapped a rope around one end of the board and started dragging it. This mutt latched onto the other with its sturdy teeth, and they dragged it all the way up to the walkway. Then Anyuta asked our neighbor for nails and took my hammer. There she goes, trying to nail the board in place. But she was having trouble. My neighbor saw Anyuta sitting on the boardwalk trying her best. She'd hammered her hand bloody. The mutt's sitting next to her, looking and whimpering.</p><p>"'My neighbor came over, took the hammer, and nailed the board in place. The next day, late in the afternoon, my neighbor saw Anyuta and her dog dragging another board. To patch another hole in the walkway.</p><p>"'"What are you doing, Anyuta? Are you going to nail new boards over all the holes? Couldn't you think up something else to do, something for girls?" the neighbor asks. My granddaughter answers her, "I really have to do this, auntie, so that all the walkways along all the houses are new and don't have holes. What if visitors were coming to some house and they walked over the walkway and there were holes in them and it spoiled the visitors' cheerful mood? And my mama, when she comes, she might be upset by the unfestive walkways."</p><p>"'The neighbor lady nailed the second board. Then she gave everyone hell. She went from yard to yard and raised a ruckus with everyone: "Fix the walks by your own houses! I can't watch a child suffering over your laziness. She's smashing her hands bloody."</p><p>"'And look! They repaired their walks, each by his own house, so they wouldn't have to hear that woman's ruckus.'</p><p>"'Where is your granddaughter now?' I asked the old man.</p><p>"'She hauled paint to the last hut. She's probably spending the night in the last hut, with the old Losins. Yes. . . . She may be spending the night there.'</p><p>"'What paint? What for?'</p><p>"Regular paint, oil, bright orange. She exchanges fish for paint at the ship. My granddaughter has a new fancy now.'</p><p>"'How so?'</p><p>"'She's decided all the huts should look cheerful. Joyful. When the ship comes—you know, the one that collects the fish people catch—she takes her fish there and trades it all for paint. Then she carries the can to some hut. She asks them to paint their window frames, and the old folks do. It'll be my turn before too long. All right! I'll paint them. Why not? Maybe it is better if we paint, so the huts look more cheerful on the outside.'</p><p>"'Where does she get the fish?'</p><p>"'She catches them herself—at least three every day, two beloribitsas at least—and brings them in the morning, sometimes even more. If only once she didn't, but no, those fish latch onto her hooks. Every morning she tells me with my radiculitis, "Get up, it's all here. Get up, Granddad. Salt the fish so it doesn't go bad." Every morning it's like that,' the old man grumbled without rancor.</p><p>"'How does she manage the tackle? Alone?'</p><p>"'I'm telling you, Anyuta has a helper, that old husky, the Siberian. It's an old mutt but smart, and it obeys her. He's her accomplice in all her whims. Anyuta takes my lure with the five hooks, baits them, and takes the husky with her to the river in the evening. She's got her favorite spot there. Secures one end of the line to a peg on the bank, then throws the line over a stick, and the dog takes the stick in its teeth and swims. Swims as long as Anyuta on the bank keeps telling it, "Swim, my friend, swim, my friend." The dog drags the lure as long as Anyuta keeps talking to it from the bank. When it gets to the spot, Anyuta starts talking to it differently. "Come to me, my friend, come." The dog drops the stick and goes back to the bank. Enough! Let's go to bed.'</p><p>"The old man lay down on the stove, I on the wooden bench. I awoke at dawn, went outside, and saw Anyuta down by the river, holding onto a ring and dragging a line. The big Siberian husky was helping her. The husky had its teeth in the ring and was digging in, pulling back. Together they dragged out the lure with a decent catch.</p><p>"Anyuta wore rubber boots about three sizes too big, over bare feet.</p><p>"When they'd dragged the catch to shore, she grabbed her net and ran to pull out the fish. The husky dug in its paws and held the ring in its teeth. Anyuta went farther into the water than the boots allowed, and water started pouring over the tops.</p><p>"She dragged it to shore, took the hooks out of three excellent fish, and put them in her sack. Then she and the husky picked up the rope and started dragging the plywood the sack was lying on.</p><p>"Water sloshed out of Anyuta's boots, hindering her progress. Anyuta stopped, removed one boot, then the other, and standing barefoot on the cold ground, poured the water out of them. She put the wet boots back on and went about her business.</p><p>"When she and the husky had dragged their morning catch to the front stoop, I looked at Anyuta's face and was astounded.</p><p>"Her glowing ruddy cheeks, eyes glittering with determination, and a happy smile lurking on her lips made her look nothing like the pale yellowish, once sickly little girl. Anyuta started trying to wake her grandfather, and breathing hard, he climbed off the stove, threw on his jacket, picked up his knife and salt, and went to dress the fish. When Anyuta poured me tea, I asked why she brought home fish at such an early hour every day.</p><p>"'The nice men from the ship on the river come and take the fish from us. They give me money. And also I asked them to bring paint for our houses. They brought it for the fish and also pretty fabric for a dress. I gave them all the fish I caught in a week for it,' Anyuta answered, and she took out a large piece of magnificent silk.</p><p>"'You have enough for more than one dress here, Anyuta. Why so much?' I asked.</p><p>"'It's not for me. It's for my mama I'm making a present. When she comes, I'll give her a pretty scarf, too, and some long beads.'</p><p>"Anyuta took imported stockings, pearls, and a magnificent flowered scarf out of a worn suitcase.</p><p>"'I don't want my mama to be upset that she can't buy me presents. I'm going to buy everything for her now, so she doesn't think her life didn't work out.'</p><p>"I watched as she joyously showed me the presents for her mother. Happy, she admired them, and I realized that little Anyuta had been transformed from an utterly helpless, pathetic creature waiting for someone's help into an effective, self-confident person. Furthermore, she was happy because she had achieved something, but her happiness may have come from something else, too. I think each person's happiness is inside. It is at a specific level of consciousness. Only how to reach that level—that is the question! Anastasia helped little Anyuta. Would she be able to help everyone else? Or maybe we ourselves need to figure out how to learn."</p><p>Alexander fell silent, and we were each left with our own thoughts.</p><p>Wrapped in a sheepskin jacket, I lay my head on a log and started looking at the bright northern stars, which seemed very low over us, warming themselves at our fire, too. I tried to go to sleep.</p><p>After sleeping a few hours, Alexander and I walked up to the launch at dawn. But before pushing off, Alexander suddenly said to me, "I think . . . I'm certain. You shouldn't go into the taiga. You won't find Anastasia now. No one can, including you."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Anastasia's gone. Gone deeper in. She had to. If you go, you might perish. You're not equipped for the taiga, and you still need to write. Keep your promise to her."</p><p>"In order to write more, I have to hear her answers to many readers' questions. On raising children, on religions . . ."</p><p>"No one can find her now."</p><p>"How you do go on about not finding her! I know where her glade is. I'll find her."</p><p>"I'm telling you, you won't. Anastasia can't help but understand that the hunt for her is on."</p><p>"What hunt? Has someone bribed the local hunters? Like you and Egorich?"</p><p>"Egorich and I keep trying to convince them not to interfere, not to bother her. When we fail, we take them to the opposite bank. You can't bribe the local hunters. They have their own laws and values. They knew about Anastasia long before you did. They held her in the deepest respect. Even among themselves they spoke cautiously. The hunters would not like to see an outsider in the taiga, and their aim is good."</p><p>"So who might be hunting for her?"</p><p>"I think it's whoever brought us to where we are today, and they're going to keep it up."</p><p>"More specifically?</p><p>"Each person has to puzzle that out for himself."</p><p>"Still, who do you have in mind? People like Boris Moiseyevich?"</p><p>"He's just a tool. Something we can't see is playing with us. Both Boris Moiseyevich now and whoever stood behind him apparently has understood that, too."</p><p><div class=chapter id=0311>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>11. Who Are We?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>"A month ago, Boris Moiseyevich came back to these parts," Alexander told me, "this time without guards or assistants. Quiet and thoughtful, he sought me out. He and I talked for an entire day. Or rather, it wasn't a conversation, but his confession—not to me, of course, but a confession to himself. He gave me a copy of his report on his contact with Anastasia. I took some excerpts from it for you. Do you want me to read them out loud?"</p><p>"Who was the report done for?"</p><p>"I don't know and neither does Boris Moiseyevich. He met his client in a well-appointed room with a fireplace. The client called himself a representative of the International Academy. But there are a lot of academies around now. Just try to figure out which are the most serious. Now people judge seriousness by the extent of the financing.</p><p>"This client wasn't stingy. He paid for the entire trip up front in cash and promised a considerable bonus to the group. He also promised to include the entire section Boris Moiseyevich heads up in a serious scientific program connected with Anastasia.</p><p>"When Boris Moiseyevich met with him after his return and gave him his report, the client looked through the report quickly. Apparently he was already well informed.</p><p>"He threw the report into the fireplace and told Boris Moiseyevich, 'Your assignment was to make contact with X, as you yourself called Anastasia. You used not only your own scientific methods and persuasive abilities but also violence in carrying out the assignment. The violence was your initiative. We've decided to double the fee for this expedition, but in the future to break off relations with you. Take your fee'—he pointed to the briefcase next to the armchair— 'and forget about the expedition.'</p><p>"Boris Moiseyevich tried to explain that the violence was an accident and that he himself found the whole business distasteful. He realized the harm their group's clumsiness had done for future contacts with Anastasia, so he refused the fee for himself altogether.</p><p>"Then the man sitting by the fireplace rose from his chair, and in a voice brooking no objection, said, 'Take it and leave. Your enthusiasm was for the money, not the cause. So take it. You're no use to us anymore.'</p><p>"Boris Moiseyevich took the briefcase with the money and left the spacious office. He tried to share the money equally among the expedition participants, but they wouldn't all take it. The money seemed to accentuate the magnitude of something unpleasant the expedition participants had done."</p><p>"Why did you just write out excerpts from the report?" I asked Alexander.</p><p>"Judging from the book, you don't really like to read works full of terms you don't understand. I tried to write down the main points and without special terminology."</p><p>"What do they say about Anastasia?"</p><p>Alexander took the printed pages out of his pocket and read to me.</p><p>"X cannot be subjected to ordinary study and the scientific methods known to us today.</p><p>"'Scientifically acceptable assessment criteria would inevitably create a specific framework that omitted previously unknown properties and possibilities of the phenomena that arise and are connected with individual situations more than likely due to X's fluctuating psychic state.'</p><p>"'As an information source in various spheres of scientific research, the "subject" could far surpass those scientific sources currently known.</p><p>"'The subject herself is more than likely not the bearer of information. She has no ordinary interest in obtaining and analyzing information. However, when a goal arises important to her—as a result of desire—information in the necessary quantity comes to her in a form selected by someone and instantly may find practical application by subject X.</p><p>"'Our group was able to provide only a few hypotheses, but it did confirm empirically several statements by X about plants. It established the fact of the ray's existence. The scientific terms "torsion field" and "radio wave emission" are probably not appropriate here. If we use them, it is only because we have no others more appropriate.</p><p>"'What was most incredible and dubious, in our opinion, was the possibility of investing, hiding, in the text of a book, combinations and signs that were, according to X's terminology, "as deep as eternity and as infinite as the Cosmos."</p><p>"'According to the subject's own assertion, these signs could have a beneficial effect on people.</p><p>"'We proposed conducting a series of experiments, comparing the parameters of physiological changes in a person before and after reading the book with the help of instruments used in medical research. Now, however, this does not make great sense.</p><p>"'Now we are compelled to state the incontrovertibility of their existence. Their effect comes about not through physiological or material organs but on some intangible, nonmaterial level of the socium.</p><p>"'One gets the impression that among the community of people living on earth there is beginning to be a reaction that we can neither control nor, consequently, stop.</p><p>"'The main fact confirming its existence is the psychic reaction of people who have come into contact with the book. A survey, testing, and analysis of correspondence from readers attest to the emergence in the majority of a creative surge expressed in the form of poems, drawings, and songs. Many develop the need to touch a plant, plant something, change profession. In individual instances, we observed significant improvement in how they felt and a disappearance of symptoms of illness.</p><p>"'We conducted the experiment on thirty people with various illnesses. In the psychotherapy and therapeutic sleep office, we offered them the book to read. In twenty-seven, emotional focus was observed, sleep did not follow, and hemoglobin in the blood rose. If one assumes that the readers' reaction occurs because of the vividness of the literary-artistic image, then we can say that this image, in its psychological effect, surpasses all those previously known, including classical and Biblical, by several orders of magnitude.</p><p>"'The incontrovertibility of this assertion is shown by the percentage of readers who expressed themselves in poetic or some other creative form.</p><p>"'Statistically, this is expressed as 1:19. At the same time, the author's expository style itself is simple to the point of primitivism. The well-established canons of artistic literary creation are not observed, and the text contains grammatical errors. At the same time, though, testing the text for readability via computer program shows that the readability level is at least eighty percent!</p><p>"'While in direct contact with object X, we observed a phenomenon never before encountered that did not correspond to any that have ever been observed or described by UFO-ologists.</p><p>"'We observed a spherical energy cluster that looked like large ball lightning. Its energy potential exceeds present-day science's existing notions about the force of natural energies. Its ability to change the Earth's gravitational field locally allows it to turn everything that is not rooted in the earth to cosmic dust in a single instant.</p><p>"'At the moment of our contact, the Earth's gravitation changed insignificantly, but when it increased its efforts, we and all the material objects could simply have ended up in the abyss of the cosmos. Nevertheless, around X the gravitational field did not change, which speaks to the possibility of precise and targeted actions.</p><p>"'The alteration in the earth's attraction was visibly preceded by a reduction in the blue spectrum of daylight.</p><p>"'Thus, we can conjecture that the Earth's so-called attraction depends not on the Earth itself, its mass, but on the light pressure emanating from certain cosmic objects, energies, or a sheathing for the Earth created by someone.</p><p>"'Despite her ability to acquire large amounts of information, X does not try to analyze it. She perceives what she receives at the level of emotions and intuition, which gives her the impression of naïveté. Relations between X and the energy cluster are ordinary and simple; they are built on the level of emotions, in a complete absence of servility or worship. Given the mutual respect they have for each other, they retain perfect freedom of action.</p><p>"'The shining energy cluster we observed possesses intellect and, what is most incredible, emotions, such as has not been noted by UFO-ologists in a single UFO. Testimony to its sensitivity is the fact that upon contact, the rays of the energy cluster stroked the feet and hair of subject X, and, by its actions, reacted to X's emotional state.</p><p>"'Along with the possibility of having a physiological influence on matter, the subject we saw can exert a psychological influence.</p><p>"'By way of hypothesis, subject X may be one of those earthly persons with whom representatives of extraterrestrial civilization come into contact periodically, or else some natural phenomenon not susceptible to study interacts with the object.</p><p>"'By way of hypothesis, object X itself could be from a civilization beyond earth. However, the object's own statement—"I am a human being, a woman"—contradicts this. Such a statement puts us at an impasse, since the question arises, Who, then, are we? Or, put another way, Has humanity progressed or regressed?'"</p><p><div class=chapter id=0312>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>12. Mutants, Created by People</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>"All right, that's enough," I interrupted Alexander. "For me, Anastasia is a hermit—with unusual abilities, to be sure, but a human being nonetheless. For now it's best to rest on that. If you overthink all this, you could flip your lid. Start up your buggy and let's get going."</p><p>The launch brought us to the abandoned village in about four hours. As I disembarked on the familiar bank, Alexander got out of the launch, too, and went back to what he had been saying before.</p><p>"Anastasia's gone, Vladimir. Think carefully. Maybe you'll cancel your excursion to the taiga glade after all? You won't get to it."</p><p>"I'm going." I picked up my backpack to put it on my shoulders and suddenly saw Alexander pull a large hunting knife out of its sheath.</p><p>Dropping the backpack, I scanned the ground for something to defend myself. But Alexander bared his right arm to the elbow and with the knife slashed his own arm. He covered the blood spurting from the wound with his white linen scarf. Then he asked me to get the first-aid kit out of the launch and tie up his arm. Without understanding a thing, I did so. He handed me the blood-stained scarf.</p><p>"Tie this around your head."</p><p>"What for?"</p><p>"At least the hunters won't touch you. They don't shoot at the wounded."</p><p>"What are they anyway, your hunters? Fools? They'll approach and immediately see the sham."</p><p>"They won't approach. Why risk it? Each has his own trails and lands. If someone needs to go into the taiga with good intentions, then first he'll speak to the hunters, tell them about himself and his intentions, and agree on his hike. If he has good intentions, they'll help, advise, and may guide him themselves. They know nothing about you. They might give you a slap without asking questions, but they won't shoot an injured man."</p><p>I took the blood-stained scarf and tied it around my head.</p><p>"Maybe I should thank you, but somehow I don't feel like it."</p><p>"No need. I'm not doing this for thanks. I feel like doing something, at least. When you get back, light a fire on the bank. I'll pass nearby from time to time and see the smoke. I'll pick you up if you manage to return."</p><p>As I approached the taiga, I saw two dogs moving about a hundred meters away from me. Probably from the village, I thought. It would be good if they came closer. Things are calmer with dogs. I even tried to lure them, but the dogs wouldn't approach, continuing to move in parallel with me, and so we entered the taiga. Alexander was wrong to try to frighten me. The taiga did not seem hostile to me, perhaps due to the feeling that here, among these trees and slopes, lived Anastasia. She may have been strange, but she was still a good person. Most importantly, however, in this taiga—with its slopes and sounds and air so unusual for a city dweller—lived my own son. That made the taiga seem just a little dearer.</p><p>It's harder to cover twenty-five kilometers from bank to glade than over an ordinary road, because I had to climb over fallen trees and skirt bushes. When I'd walked with Anastasia, the conversation had taken my mind off these obstacles. The main thing was not to let them put me off course, and I started checking my compass more and more often. I thought, "How does Anastasia find the glade without a compass? There doesn't seem to be any trail, either."</p><p>Resting after every hour of my journey, by midday I had reached a small stream about two meters wide. When I'd walked with Anastasia, we'd crossed the stream, too. I decided to cross to the other bank and make an extended halt in the glade adjacent to the river. I walked across the trunk of a half-rotted tree that had fallen in the stream. The tree fell a little short of the bank, and I first tossed my backpack across and then jumped myself. But somehow I stumbled. My foot caught on something and got sprained or strained. A terrible pain shot through my leg and even made it all the way up to my head. I lay there briefly, tried to get up, and realized I wasn't going to be able to walk. I lay there contemplating what to do next. I tried to remember what you're usually supposed to do when you have a sprain or strain, but I was having a hard time. The pain was probably getting in the way. I decided to lie there and have a bite to eat. Perhaps the pain would begin to subside. If necessary, I would start a fire and spend the night. By morning maybe my foot really would be better. After all, everything gradually heals on a person.</p><p>That was when I saw the dogs again. There were four of them now, and on the other side another two. They weren't going anywhere. They had lain down on different sides of me about ten meters away. The dogs were different breeds: one an Airedale terrier, another a boxer, and the others some mix. There was even a little poodle among them. The dogs' fur was clumped, they were skinny, and the Airedale's eyes oozed. I remembered the captain's mate's story about dogs like this. And my awareness of the situation even made me stop feeling the pain in my foot for a while.</p><p>The captain's mate on my headquarters ship had told me that people who wanted to get rid of their four-legged pets took them somewhere far away and abandoned them. If they were abandoned at the city limits, cats and dogs would group around dumps, which gave them at least some nourishment. When the dogs were taken to remote places, far form the city, they formed packs and hunted their food, attacking animals—even people, especially solitary ones. These dogs were more frightening than wolves. They tried to waylay a wounded or exhausted victim and attacked simultaneously. Feral dogs that have formed a pack are more dangerous than wolves because they know people's habits better and hate them. They are angry at people. They don't have experience hunting game, like the wolves, but they do people.</p><p>It's especially frightening if in the pack there is at least one dog that was trained to attack people.</p><p>I once had a dog that I took to obedience school. Among other training in carrying out all kinds of commands, there is an exercise in attacking a person. The instructor's assistant puts on a padded coat with long arms, and the staff teaches the dog to attack him and bite like crazy. If the dog does well at the exercise, they encourage it and give it a treat. They learned their lesson—smart dogs.</p><p>I wonder whether there is a single creature in this wide world other than man that would take the time to train other species to attack his own kind?</p><p>The dogs surrounding me tightened their ring. I thought, "I have to show them I'm still alive and can move and defend myself." I picked up a short stick and threw it at the closest large and shabby mongrel. The dog dodged the stick and lay back down. There weren't any more sticks nearby. Then I took two cans of food out of my backpack. While I was getting them out the smallest dog, the poodle, crept up from behind, sunk its teeth into my trousers, and leapt back while the other dogs observed. The other dogs were probably looking to see how I would react to the poodle's attack.</p><p>I threw one can at a very large dog nearby and another at the poodle. I had nothing else to throw. Despair filtered into my consciousness.</p><p>I pictured the dogs tearing my body apart and eating pieces of it. Then, still conscious, I would see everything, doubled up with pain, because the dogs wouldn't be able to kill me right away, and I had nothing to help me die quickly, without prolonged agony.</p><p>It was also too bad that I hadn't been able to deliver my backpack with gifts for Anastasia from readers or the various baby things my son needed in my backpack.</p><p>Half the backpack was filled with readers' questions and requests. Lots of letters, unusual letters—about the soul, about life—and lots of poems—unprofessional poems maybe, not always rhymed, but in a certain sense fine. Now all this would be lost. It would rot here. Then I got an idea. I decided to write a note and put it in the cellophane bag with the letters. A note! If anyone found the backpack, they could take all its contents and the money, too, but the readers' letters would be sent on to my daughter Polina. I wrote in the note that she should publish them when enough money had come in from the books. These sincere poems could not be allowed to be lost. Many may have written poems for the first time, and they were heartfelt. I could not allow the only poem in their life to be lost.</p><p>This note was hard to write. My hands were trembling—from fear, no doubt. Why is it that man clings so hard to life, even in a situation when it is absolutely clear that it's all over? Still, I finished the note, put it in the cellophane bag with the letters, and cinched the packet tighter so moisture wouldn't get in. And then I saw the dogs surrounding me, having drawn quite close, suddenly begin to perform a strange maneuver. One by one, they crawled away from me. Some half-rose and looked away from me in another direction and lay back down, as in ambush. I stood on one foot to see what had distracted them. And I saw . . . I saw Anastasia running swiftly along the stream, her magnificent golden hair fanning out behind her as she ran. Her swift running was so beautiful that I forgot the danger and admired this picture. All of a sudden, the thought scorched me like lightning: the dogs! They sensed that their prey might be taken away, and they were preparing to attack Anastasia, who was swiftly approaching us.</p><p>The starving, brutalized mongrels would fight like crazy and to the bitter end for their prey. Anastasia alone wouldn't be able to do anything with them. The dogs would tear her to pieces, and I shouted as loud as I could, "Stop! Stop, Anastasia! Dogs. There are wild dogs here! Don't come here, Anastasia! Stop!"</p><p>Anastasia heard me but did not slow her swift running the least bit. She merely raised her arm as she ran and waved it. "What is she doing?" I thought. "That unusual phenomenon can't help her now."</p><p>Very quickly I took small glass bottles of juice for the baby out of the backpack. I started throwing the bottles at the dogs, trying to draw their attention back to myself. One of the bottles landed, but the dogs paid no attention whatsoever to my attempts.</p><p>The dogs undoubtedly realized who their real threat was. The dogs rushed at Anastasia simultaneously from all sides as soon as she ran into their circle. And then . . . You really had to see this. Anastasia converted all the energy from her running into spinning. All of a sudden, she went from a full-tilt run into spinning like a top, the way ballerinas do on stage, only faster. Hitting themselves on Anastasia's spinning body, the dogs flew off in all directions without doing her any harm, but they immediately started to prepare for a new attack on her, once she had stopped.</p><p>I crawled toward Anastasia. She was wearing her light shift. If she'd had on at least a padded jacket, it would have been harder for the dogs to bite through that.</p><p>Anastasia dropped to one knee. She stood in the circle of resentful dogs half-crazed from hunger, but her face expressed no fear.</p><p>She looked at me and said quickly, "Hello, Vladimir. Do not be frightened. Rest up a little. Relax. Do not worry. They will not do anything to me, these hungry little dogs. Do not worry."</p><p>Two strapping mutts once again rushed from different sides at Anastasia, who was resting on one knee. Still talking and with a lightning-quick gesture as they leapt, she grabbed each dog by a front paw and turned them around in the air, leaning her own torso away slightly, letting the dogs collide with each other and slam into the ground.</p><p>The dogs lay back down, doubtless preparing to attack again, but they didn't.</p><p>Anastasia stood up, flung her arm up, then abruptly lowered it, and slapped her leg twice.</p><p>Four full-grown wolves instantly leapt out from behind the nearby tangles of bushes. Their swift leaps held such determination, they seemed uninterested in the strength and numbers of the foe they faced. They would fight them.</p><p>The dogs tucked their tails between their legs and took to their heels. The wolves rushed past me, and I felt their hot breath. A very young cub that looked like a sheepdog puppy raced after the wolves, trying as hard as it could not to be left behind, and so darted past, taking tiny leaps. When it came even with Anastasia, it suddenly braked with all four paws and even turned a somersault. It jumped up and twice licked a fresh scratch on Anastasia's bare foot.</p><p>Anastasia quickly picked the cub up by the body and lifted it off the ground.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going? It's too soon for you. You're still little."</p><p>The cub kept twisting in Anastasia's arms and whimpered like a puppy. It managed to break away, or else she herself let it go. Once it was on the ground, the cub again quickly licked the scratch and set out to run down the wolf pack.</p><p>"But why?" I began speaking to Anastasia, who had run up to me. "Why didn't you call the wolves in right away? Why?"</p><p>Anastasia smiled and quickly felt my legs and arms. In a pure, reassuring voice, she said, "Please don't worry. I had to show the dogs that man is always stronger than they are. They are afraid of the wolves anyway, but they were attacking a human being. Now they won't. . . . Don't worry. When I felt—realized—you were coming, I ran to meet you. Why did you take such a risk? There you went. . . . I lost you at first, but then I guessed."</p><p>Anastasia ran off to the side, picked some herb, and then searched in a different spot and picked another. She rubbed the herbs in her palms and cautiously rubbed the hurt foot with her moist palms. And she kept saying, "It will pass. It will pass quickly. You will live to see your wedding."</p><p>I noticed that she used all kinds of sayings. I asked her, "How did you learn those sayings?"</p><p>"Sometimes I listen to how different people talk, to learn how to express a bigger thought in a shorter phrase. Don't you like it?"</p><p>"Sometimes it's out of place."</p><p>"But sometimes in of place? It's good when it's in of place?"</p><p>"What 'in of place'?"</p><p>"You said it first. I just repeated it."</p><p>"Tell me, Anastasia. Is the glade far?"</p><p>"You have gone halfway. Together we will reach it quickly now."</p><p>"Probably not quickly. My foot still hurts."</p><p>"Yes, it may hurt a little more. Let your foot rest up while I help you walk."</p><p>Anastasia easily lifted the heavy backpack, turned her back to me, dropped to one knee, and suggested, "Hold on. Climb on me. On my back." She spoke so quickly and decisively that I did climb on her back, wrapping my arms around her neck. Anastasia rose quickly and lightly and skipped along. All the time, she spoke on the run.</p><p>"I'm not too heavy?" I asked after a while.</p><p>"A burden of one's own choosing is never heavy," Anastasia replied.</p><p>She also added, laughing, "I'm a peasant, I'm a bull, I'm a woman, I'm a mule."</p><p>"Stop. Let me down. I'm going to try to walk myself."</p><p>"But it's not heavy for me. Why?"</p><p>"Why did you say that about a mule? 'I'm a woman, I'm a mule?'"</p><p>"That's just an expression. I said it inappropriately, didn't I? Are you insulted?"</p><p>"It doesn't matter. I just want to try to walk myself. Just carry the backpack a little more."</p><p>"If you're going to walk yourself, then you need to rest your foot for at least another hour. You sit here for a while, I'll be quick, I'll be right back." Anastasia ran off for a while. She returned with a bunch of different herbs and once again began rubbing them into my foot near the instep. Then she sat down next to me, smiled slyly at the backpack, and suddenly asked, "Please tell me, Vladimir, what is in your backpack?"</p><p>"Some letters from readers. Presents for you from them. And I bought a few things for the child."</p><p>"Could you show me the presents now, while we're resting?"</p><p>"And will you show me my child, my son? You're not going to say he shouldn't see me until I'm cleansed, are you?"</p><p>"Fine. I will show you our son. Only not right away. Tomorrow I will. First you have to understand a little about being with him. You will understand quickly when you see him."</p><p>"Tomorrow then."</p><p>I undid the backpack and started setting out the presents for Anastasia first. She picked up each item carefully, examined it with interest, and stroked it. She began ringing the Valdai bells given her by Olga Sidorovna, and when I handed her the large pretty flowered scarf also given her by a good woman, Valentina Ivanovna, I immediately realized that women are women, and much in them is identical.</p><p>Anastasia took the scarf and unfolded it. Then she tried the scarf in many different ways. She tied the scarf around her head, like on the Alyonushka candy wrapper, and in yet another way.</p><p>Laughing, Anastasia tied the scarf around her waist, like a gypsy, threw it over her shoulders and paraded in front of me in a kind of folk dance.</p><p>She neatly folded the scarf, placed it on the presents set out on the grass, and said, "Vladimir, please thank each woman for her soul's warmth that was sent with these things."</p><p>"I'll tell any of them I see. But I have nothing more to show you. The rest isn't for you. It's for our son. Everything he needs. You may not use it. I'll show you myself when we get there."</p><p>"Why don't you want to now? We're sitting here resting, after all. I'm very curious to see."</p><p>I didn't want to show Anastasia what I'd bought for our son because I remembered what she'd said at our first meeting: "You would like to acquire all kinds of pointless rattles for our son. But he doesn't need them. You do, for your own satisfaction. 'What a good and concerned person I am.'" Nonetheless, I decided to show her because I, too, was curious to see how she would regard our civilization's achievements in caring for children. I began showing Anastasia the diapers and telling her how effective they were at absorbing moisture when the baby peed in them, so that the baby's skin didn't chafe. Telling her everything I'd seen in the television ad. I showed her the baby food.</p><p>"You see, Anastasia, this is baby food. It is simply a masterpiece. It contains all the substances essential for a child, and it has vitamin supplements in it, too. But most of all it can be prepared easily. Dissolve it in warm water and the cereal is ready. Do you see?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Well then, that means the factory chimneys of our technocratic world aren't just blowing smoke. Among them are the smokestacks of factories that produce this baby food and the packaging. See, the handsome, rosy-cheeked, smiling baby on the package?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The last thing I showed Anastasia was the erector set, and I immediately commented, "This is a children's erector set, not some pointless rattle. It says here that it's especially designed for child development. You can make a car out of it, like in this picture, or a train, a plane, a house. Our son will put it to good use a little later. Right now, of course, it's still too soon for him to make sense of how it moves and flies."</p><p>"Why too soon? He can make sense of this right now," Anastasia replied.</p><p>"You'll see. The erector set will help him do that."</p><p>"You think so? Are you certain?"</p><p>"This isn't a matter of just my certainty, Anastasia. Many scientists think so, as do the psychologists who study the child's psyche. See, they've written their conclusion in the annotation."</p><p>"All right, Vladimir, all right. Don't worry. You'll do everything as you see fit. Only please, first look at how our son lives. Then you can determine for yourself what he needs above all."</p><p>"Fine. As you say." I rejoiced that Anastasia hadn't disputed the necessity of the things I'd brought. "I'll look for myself and decide."</p><p>"But for now, let's hide your backpack. Later, when you decide which thing he needs first I'll run here and bring it or bring the whole backpack. Right now it's too heavy to carry. Your foot hurts and you do not want me to carry you."</p><p>"Oh, all right, we can hide it for now," I agreed. "Only let's take the letters. They contain a lot of questions for you. I can't remember them all."</p><p>"Fine, we will take the letters," Anastasia agreed. She took the packet of letters. I leaned on her shoulder and we started off toward Anastasia's glade.</p><p>We arrived at Anastasia's glade only late that evening.</p><p>As before, there was nothing there—no structures whatsoever, not even a hut. Yet I felt as if I'd come home. My mood even lifted and a certain tranquility came over me. I felt sleepy, probably because I'd spent all night talking with Alexander. "Great," I thought. "There is absolutely nothing in this glade, and I feel as though I've come home.</p><p>"Clearly, the sense of home doesn't lie in the size of your apartment or even castle but in something else."</p><p>Anastasia immediately led me to the little lake and suggested I bathe. I had no desire whatsoever to bathe, but I thought it was better to obey her in everything for now, in order to see my son sooner.</p><p>After bathing, when I came out on the bank, I was colder than I'd been in the water. Anastasia chased the water off me with her palms, rubbed me with herbs, and my body became almost hot.</p><p>Then she held out her shift and said, laughing, "Please put this on, Vladimir. This will be your nightshirt. I'll soak and wash your clothing. It has a strong smell."</p><p>I put on Anastasia's shift because I realized the smell had to be eliminated.</p><p>"Is this so our son won't be frightened?"</p><p>"For him, too," Anastasia replied.</p><p>"But I'll be cold sleeping in just this shift."</p><p>"Don't worry, I've taken care of everything. You will get a good night's sleep, and you will not be cold. You will put the packet of letters under your head for a pillow. I've thought of everything. You will get a good night's sleep and you will not freeze."</p><p>"Warm myself on a she-bear again? I'm not going to sleep with a bear. I'd rather get along on my own."</p><p>"I made your bed so that you would not be cold or hot."</p><p>We walked up to the dugout where I had slept before. Anastasia moved aside the branches hanging over the entrance. I smelled the pleasant fragrance of dried herbs, crawled into the dugout, and plunged into the grasses. A pleasant sleep enveloped me languorously.</p><p>"You can cover up with my blouse, but even without it you won't be cold. If you like, I can lie down beside you, too. I'll keep you warm."</p><p>I heard what Anastasia said through my sleep and replied, "No need. You should go to our son, warm him. . . ."</p><p>"Don't worry, Vladimir. Our son already takes care of himself a great deal ."</p><p>"How can he? He's still little." Before I could say another word, I plunged into a deep and peaceful bliss.</p><p><div class=chapter id=0313>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>13. A New Morning Like a New Life</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>I woke up in the morning. I was in such an unusually good mood that I lay there thinking I wouldn't move, just to hold onto the feeling. What kind of night had it been? Why in the morning did it seem that during the night, my body and consciousness had bathed in love? In the light of day, it became clear to me why I had been neither cold nor hot that night. I had lain there deep in dry herbs and flowers, which gave off a pleasant fragrance and warmed me. Readers often ask how Anastasia keeps from freezing in winter, in the fierce Siberian cold, but it's all very simple. If you burrow into a haystack, no cold can scare you. True, she also warms herself in some other way, walks around half-naked—even when it's all of five degrees Centigrade—and doesn't freeze. She even bathes at those low temperatures and doesn't shiver when she gets out of the water.</p><p>As I lay blissfully on the dry grasses, I also thought, "Here morning has begun, or a new day has come, and I have the impression that the beginning of a new life has come, that if it were always like this, every morning, then one life would be like living thousands of centuries, each century as beautiful as this morning. But what can I do so that every new day is as beautiful as this morning?"</p><p>I got up only when I heard Anastasia's cheerful voice.</p><p>"God gives much to those who rise early."</p><p>I climbed out of my night's wonderful bedroom. She was standing up top, right by the entrance. Her golden hair was braided and tied at the bottom with herbs, like a ribbon. Her new hairstyle suited her well, too.</p><p>"Let's go to the lake and you'll wash and dress," Anastasia proposed, tossing her braid forward, like a flirt.</p><p>"Good heavens, women are women," I thought, and I said to her, "That's a very pretty braid you have, Anastasia."</p><p>"Pretty. Really? Very very pretty?" She started to laugh, twirling.</p><p>We ran to the lake. On the bank, on the branches of bushes, hung my shirt, trousers, and tee-shirt—everything I'd left the night before. I touched them and they were already dry.</p><p>"How did they dry so quickly?"</p><p>"I helped them," Anastasia replied. "I put them on and ran a little in your clothing, so it dried quickly. Now you'll bathe and put it on."</p><p>"And will you bathe?"</p><p>"I've already done everything necessary to greet the day."</p><p>Before I stepped into the water, Anastasia rubbed my body with an herbal pulp. And when I dove in, the water around me hissed and my body tingled, but when I got out of the water I felt wonderful, as if all the pores of my body had been breathing intensively themselves and each had inhaled air itself. Breathing in general was free and easy.</p><p>Cheerful and playful, Anastasia began chasing the drops from my body again, like the evening before. When she wiped them off my back, I suddenly felt something hot suddenly splash down my back. "One, two"—I abruptly turned around. She squeezed her breast and hot breast milk right in my face, and then squirted more from the other onto my chest. And now, laughing, rubbed it off very fast.</p><p>"Why would you do such a thing?" I asked when I had recovered from my surprise.</p><p>"Because! Because!" Anastasia laughed and then handed me my trousers and shirt. They, too, did not smell as they had before. I immediately noticed that when I put them on.</p><p>I told Anastasia firmly, "I've done everything the way you wanted. Now show me my son."</p><p>"Fine. Let's go. Only please, Vladimir, don't try to approach him right away. First observe and try to understand him."</p><p>"Fine, I'll observe. All right. And I'll understand."</p><p>We walked over to the glade I already knew.</p><p>By the bushes at the glade's edge, Anastasia said, "We'll sit here quietly and watch. He's going to wake up soon and you'll see him."</p><p>A bear lay on its side near a tree at the glade's edge, but I didn't see any child. Excitement began to grip me more and more, and my heart started beating strangely.</p><p>"Where is he?" I asked Anastasia, getting more and more excited.</p><p>"Look closer," she replied. "There, his head and little feet are poking out from under the bear's paw. He's sleeping on her, in her groin. It's soft and warm there, and she holds him there with her paw. She doesn't press, just covers him a little with her paw."</p><p>Then I saw him. The baby's tiny body was resting in the bear's thick fur, in the groin of this huge beast, under her slightly raised front paw. The bear lay on her side motionless, just looking around. The tiny little legs moved in the thick fur, and immediately the bear lifted her paw slightly. The baby was waking up. When he moved his little hand, the bear raised her paw; when he lowered his hand, she covered it again. Only her paw and head moved; her body didn't budge.</p><p>"You mean the bear lies there like that, without moving? Isn't it uncomfortable being in one position all the time?"</p><p>
"She can lie like that for a long time without moving. That is not at all hard. She is thrilled when he crawls into his little bed. In general, the bear now thinks very highly of herself indeed—responsible. She wouldn't even let her friend approach when the time came for them to procreate. That is not so good. But when our son grows up a little, she will let her friend approach."</p><p>I listened to Anastasia while riveted to the sight of the little feet moving again under the bear's huge paw. Then the paw lifted.</p><p>The baby moved his little arms and legs, stretched, raised his little head, and suddenly fell still.</p><p>"Why did he stop moving? Is he going to go back to sleep?" I asked Anastasia.</p><p>"Look closer. He's urinating. Once again, the bear did not lower him to the grass in time, or didn't want to. She's spoiling him."</p><p>A little fountain poured on the bear's fur. She lay there, like the baby, perfectly still. The bear stopped moving her head and paw until the little fountain turned off. Then the bear began to turn onto her other side, and the baby slid onto the grass.</p><p>"Good. There, you see? She realizes he is going to continue going about his other business, our little man," Anastasia informed me gaily.</p><p>The tiny little body lay on the ground and bore down. The huge bear stood over him and was apparently trying to help him with her rumbling, as if she herself were bearing down with him. The baby turned over on his tummy, started moving his arms, and crawled over the grass. His bottom was a little stained with poop. The bear took a step in his direction and licked the little human's bottom with her huge tongue, wiping up the spots, like a nanny. Her tongue pushed the baby. He plopped on his tummy but got right back up and crawled on, while the bear went after him and licked him again, even though he was all clean now.</p><p>"What do you think, Vladimir? Could she take off his diapers or underpants and then put new ones on him?" Anastasia asked quietly.</p><p>"All right already," I replied, also in a whisper. "I get it."</p><p>The baby turned over on his back, and when the persistent bear licked him another time between the legs, he latched onto the fur of the bear's face with his little hand.</p><p>Obeying his hand's obviously insignificant efforts, the huge bear head lay down on the ground at the baby's feet, he grabbed her face and with the other hand pulled himself up and started climbing up the beast's head.</p><p>"Where does he think he's going?"</p><p>"Toward the bear's eyes. Her eyes shine, and he's curious. He always wants to touch them."</p><p>The baby lay on his tummy on the bear's face, examined her eye, and tried to touch it with his little finger, but the bear blinked. His little finger touched the eyelid. After waiting a little longer and not seeing the shining eye anymore, the baby started climbing down off the bear's face, crawled over the grass a little more, and stopped still, examining something in it. The bear stood up and roared twice.</p><p>"She's calling the wolf. She needs to clean herself and eat. Now you will see how amiably they talk to each other," Anastasia commented.</p><p>A little later, the wolf appeared at the edge of the glade, but the bear greeted its appearance with menacing roaring, not at all welcoming. The wolf itself behaved in anything but a friendly way. It surveyed the whole glade. With a springy step, it went a little way along the glade's edge, lay down, and then suddenly took a powerful leap and lay back down, as if ready to pounce.</p><p>"Where is their amiability?" I asked. "Why did the bear call it, only to roar at it? And the wolf is behaving menacingly, too, isn't it?"</p><p>"That is how they talk to each other. The bear stopped the wolf with its roaring to make sure it was all right—that is, not sick with something, not dangerous to let close to the human child—and whether it's strong enough to protect him. The wolf showed it was fine. It showed in deed, not words. You saw it. It moved and jumped quite high."</p><p>Having made sure of the wolf, the bear really could leave the glade calmly. The wolf lay on the grass, not far from the infant. The baby examined something a little longer, touched it in the grass, and then, noticing the wolf, crawled toward it. When he got close, he started touching its face, running his finger over the teeth in the wolf's open maw, and slapped its tongue. The wolf licked his face. Then little Vladimir crawled to its belly, touched the wolf's teats, sucked his own hand, and frowned.</p><p>"It's time for our son to eat," Anastasia began again. "But he's still not hungry enough to eat the wolf's milk. I'm going to go off for a short time now, while you sit at the edge of the glade. If he sees you and is curious, he'll crawl over. But don't pick him up yourself. He's already a person, though he looks small, and he won't understand senseless babbling. Also, this would be violence if you took his arms without his consent. He will not understand you if you pick him up against his will, even if you act out of good intentions. You will make a bad impression on him."</p><p>"Fine, I won't pick him up. I'll sit like this. The wolf won't touch me?"</p><p>"Your scent is now such that it won't."</p><p>Anastasia slapped her thigh twice, the wolf got up, looked in her direction, then at the child, who was back to playing with some bug, and ran to Anastasia.</p><p>Anastasia stood up against me and called the wolf to come closer and ordered her to lie down with a gesture.</p><p>"Maybe I should pet it to really make friends," I suggested.</p><p>"It won't take to your patronizing familiarity. It understands everything and won't touch you, but it won't put up with flagrant superiority either," Anastasia replied. She sent the wolf back to the glade and ran off on business of her own, promising to return quickly.</p><p>I stepped out from behind the bushes, where Anastasia and I had been stealthily observing what was going on in the glade. I stepped out and sat down on the grass about ten meters from little Vladimir. I sat like that for about fifteen minutes. He paid no attention to me. I thought if I kept sitting quietly he would never notice me. I clucked twice.</p><p>The child turned his head and saw me. My son! My son was watching me steadily with interest, and I was watching him with such agitation that my body even started to heat up.</p><p>I felt like running over, picking up his little body, and holding him close to my chest. But Anastasia's request and, most of all, the wolf's presence held me back.</p><p>Then my little son slowly began to crawl toward me. Looking at me steadily and crawling. My heart started pounding in my chest so hard I could hear it, but why was it beating so? Its hammering might frighten the baby.</p><p>But he kept crawling, and curious about something in the grass again, he started reaching for some bug. Then he started examining something crawling on his little hand. Three meters. My son stopped three meters short of crawling to me.</p><p>Over a bug. What was the world in this grass, what was the life that he found so interesting? I guess it is the forest's ways and rules here. Before the child meets his own father, he finds a bug more interesting. That shouldn't be. He should understand that his father is more important than a bug.</p><p>All of a sudden, the child raised his head in my direction again, smiled his toothless smile, and started crawling quickly, more smartly than usual. I got ready to pick him up, but he crawled past, paying no attention to me.</p><p>I looked around and saw behind me, a little to one side of me, a smiling Anastasia. She sat and put her hand on the grass palm up. The smiling child was crawling to his mother's breast. Anastasia did not pick him up but only gave him a little boost, a little help climbing to her breast. The child was already lying in her arms, slapping his little hands on his mother's bare breast, and smiling at Anastasia. He touched and stroked her nipple, brought his lips to it, and began to suck Anastasia's taut breast. Only once did Anastasia glance at me, and then to press her finger to her lips, indicating I shouldn't speak. I sat there the whole time she was feeding our son.</p><p>During the feeding, Anastasia seemed to forget all about my presence, nor did she have a thought for the whole surrounding world. She watched only our son the whole time. It also seemed as though they communicated somehow, since the child would suck and suddenly stop, break away from the nipple, and look into Anastasia's face. Sometimes he looked smiling, but sometimes seriously. Afterward, he fell still and slept for a while in his mother's arms. When he woke up he smiled again, and Anastasia sat him up on her hand, propping up his back.</p><p>Their faces were next to each other, and the child touched Anastasia's face, pressed his cheek to hers, and then saw me again. Once again, he fell still for a while, examining me with interest.</p><p>Then he reached in my direction, moved his little body toward me, and said "eh," I involuntarily reached out and Anastasia handed him to me.</p><p>I held the tiny little body of my own, much-desired son! Everything in the world was forgotten. I had a very strong desire to do something for him. The child touched my face, poked it with his lips, and recoiled and frowned, evidently getting pricked on my unshaven face. After that, I don't even know how it happened, I had an unbearable desire to kiss his warm little cheek. And I decided I would! But instead of a kiss, for some reason, I quickly licked his cheek twice, the way the wolf had. The baby recoiled and blinked his little eyes in astonishment. Anastasia's ringing, cascading laugh filled the glade. The baby immediately reached for her with both hands and started laughing, too, squirming in my arms. I realized he was asking me to let him go. My son was leaving me. Submitting to his will, to the rules of interaction established here, I cautiously lowered him to the grass. The child immediately crawled toward Anastasia, and she, laughing, jumped up, ran around me, and sat down on the other side, right next to me. The baby turned around immediately and crawled toward us, smiling, climbed into Anastasia's arms, and touched my face once again with his little hand. That's what happened the first time I met my son.</p><p><div class=chapter id=0314>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>14. What is the Father's Role?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>My son, my little Vladimir, fell asleep. After his feeding, he played with something in the grass for a while. He touched a cone that had fallen from a cedar and tried to lick it. He watched the clouds sailing by in the sky. He listened to the birds' song, climbed a mound where the grass was a little thicker, curled into a ball, shut his eyes, smiling at something, and fell asleep. Anastasia ran off on some affairs of her own. I began roaming through the forest alone, thinking, noticing nothing around me. A feeling of joy and vexation simultaneously would not quit me. I sat down under a cedar on the bank of the lake and decided I would sit like this, without stirring, until I came up with what I as a parent could contribute to my child's development. I had to think of something so that he would sense that his father was what was most important for him. When Anastasia walked up, at first I didn't feel like talking to her. It was her laughter that had distracted my son from me. Anastasia sat next to me quickly, clasping her knees, and thoughtfully gazed at the lake's calm water. She was the first to speak.</p><p>"Please don't be angry at me. Your interaction looked so funny. I couldn't help myself."</p><p>"It's not about me being angry."</p><p>"Then what?"</p><p>"In their letters many readers ask about raising children, they ask me to question you about your system of raising children and to describe it in the next book. But what is there to describe? There is no system, quite the opposite. You have some kind of antisystem here. For instance, a reader might ask what fathers should do in this kind of situation."</p><p>"You defined it very well. An antisystem. Describe that."</p><p>"Who cares about that? People are searching for authoritative books that tell them what they should do with their child when he's one month, when he's two, and so on. They schedule the child's day by the hour. Books suggest feeding timetables. They schedule childrearing activities depending on the age. But here there is complete indulgence of the child's whims. Liberty hall."</p><p>"Tell me, Vladimir. What would you like to see our son be when he grows up?"</p><p>"What do you mean? A happy, sane, successful person, of course."</p><p>"Are there many happy people among your acquaintances?"</p><p>"Happy? Well, there may only be a few completely happy people. Everyone has something that's not quite right. One doesn't have enough money. Another has family problems or suffers from various illnesses. But I'd like my son to avoid every kind of hardship."</p><p>"Think. How can he avoid them if you knowingly force him into the system by which everyone is raised? Maybe there is some reason for the fact that despite all parents wanting to see their children happy, the children grow up and turn out like everyone else—not very happy."</p><p>"Reason? In what? If you know, then tell me."</p><p>"Let's think this over together."</p><p>"People, including specialists and all kinds of scientists have been thinking about this for a long time. That's why they've created different child-rearing systems, scheduled down to the hour, in order to find the optimal one."</p><p>"You should look around more closely, Vladimir. The trees are growing, the grass and flowers. How can you schedule in advance the day and hour to water them? Are you going to water flowers when the water from the heavens washes them, or only when some expert has prescribed the watering day and time?"</p><p>"That's going overboard. This is nonsense, not an example of raising children. That doesn't happen in life."</p><p>"But it happens all the time in life. Every system is only a system. It is always aimed at taking the heart and soul away from the little person and submitting him to a system, so that he grows up like everyone else, fit for the system. This has been going on for centuries, discouraging human insight in the soul, keeping a person from unfolding in all his beauty, with his God-given soul. Given to him! To the master of all the universe."</p><p>"Hold on. Don't get worked up. Speak calmly and in normal language. What does there need to be so that children grow up with a free soul, as you put it? As masters of the Universe, happy, as God wanted it?"</p><p>"You have to stay out of their way and in their thoughts see them as God wanted. The desire of all the forces of Light in the Universe aims to convey all the best of the universe to every person born. Parents' duty is not to shut out the creating Light with artificial dogmas. For centuries, there have been disputes on Earth over which system might be wisest, but think about it yourself, Vladimir. Debate is possible where the truth has been shut out. One can discuss endlessly in fruitless debates as to what is in a room where the door is shut. All you have to do is open the door and it becomes clear to everyone. There is nothing to debate if each can see the truth."</p><p>"So who will ultimately open that door?"</p><p>"It is already open. Now you just have to open your soul's eyes and see, to understand."</p><p>"Understand what?"</p><p>"You were asking me about systems. About schedules and routines, you said that someone sets them forth in books for people. But just think. Who can speak more clearly than the Creator himself about his own creation?"</p><p>"The Creator doesn't say anything. He has been silent to this day. No one hears His words."</p><p>"There are many different meanings for one and the same words thought up by people. The Creator speaks with each patiently and with love through his imperishable and beautiful works. The rising of the sun and the glow of the moon, the soft fog and the gentle dew that plays with the sunbeam, which has gathered up the heavenly blue. There are many clear examples in the Universe. Look around. They touch you and everyone."</p><p>After that, if I were to set forth what Anastasia said about raising children, it would probably end up exactly opposite what most of us do.</p><p>I have already said that their entire ancient clan and Anastasia herself treat the newborn like a god or immaculate angel. They consider it inadmissible to interrupt the child's thought process.</p><p>Her grandfather and great-grandfather could spend a prolonged period of time observing little Anastasia enthusiastically examine a bug or flower or think about something. They tried not to distract her by their presence. They start interacting when the child himself pays attention and wants to interact. Anastasia said that at the moment when I was observing little Vladimir examining something in the grass, he was apprehending not only the bugs but the entire cosmos.</p><p>According to her, a bug is a more perfect mechanism than anything made by man, especially a primitive erector set.</p><p>A child who has the opportunity to interact with these perfect creatures himself becomes more perfect than from interacting with nonliving, primitive objects.</p><p>In addition, she says, each blade of grass and bug are interconnected with the entire universe and subsequently help the child comprehend the universal essence and himself in it, his purpose. Artificially created objects do not have this connection and set the wrong priorities and values in the child's mind.</p><p>To my comment that the conditions in which she and now our son was being raised differ greatly from those of the children in our civilized world, she replied as follows.</p><p>"Still in his mother's womb, and especially when he appears outwardly in the world as an apparently helpless child, the forces of universal Light rejoice, in the anxious hope that the newly arrived, immaculate, God-like person will be their good ruler and that the Light of Love will strengthen from the Earth.</p><p>"The Creator foresaw everything for him. The Universe is prepared, with its bug, tree, blade of grass, and outwardly fierce animal, to be a good nanny to this outwardly tiny little person, the Creator's great creation. In a surge of inspiration of light, the Creator creates man. The Earthly Paradise was created for him.</p><p>"No one and nothing is more powerful than the Creator's highest creation. His surge of love and inspiration of the light is already instantly part of each person born into the world.</p><p>"Of all the creatures of the vast Universe, only one thing can affect his destiny by coming between God, Heaven, his lucky star, and man."</p><p>"You mean to say there is a being more powerful than God in the world?"</p><p>"There is nothing more powerful in the world than Divine inspiration. But there is a being similar to him in power and capable of standing between God, the kindest teacher, and the angelic infant, man."</p><p>"Who is this? What is his name?"</p><p>"That being is the human parent."</p><p>"What? How can parents wish unhappiness on their own child?"</p><p>"Everyone wishes for happiness, but they have forgotten the way to it. This is why they commit violence, despite good intentions."</p><p>"Can you prove this?"</p><p>"You were talking about different systems of childrearing. Think about it. They vary. But the Truth is one. This alone speaks to the fact that many are being led down the wrong path."</p><p>"How can you determine the true system?"</p><p>"Try to look at life with an open soul. Clear your thoughts of fruitless bustle, and then you will see the world, the Creator of the Universe, and yourself."</p><p>"Where are ordinary eyes and where are the soul's? Who can sort that out? Speak more specifically about all this, and in simpler turns of phrase. You were saying that your speech would be like mine, but you're speaking differently. Your idiom throws me off. I can tell you speak differently."</p><p>"Only slightly differently. You will be able to remember the main thing. My speech is mixed with yours. Don't worry, don't be shy over your combinations of words. Your speech will be understood by many people. For many souls, it will open up what is hidden inside them. Let the poetry of the Universe come true in it."</p><p>"What does all this lead to? I don't want anyone to change my language."</p><p>"But weren't you insulted when a journalist called your language coarse? I and those who read can make it so that your coarse language sounds the best it can."</p><p>"All right, say that can happen, but for now I'd rather hear simple language. The problem is so complex, it's incomprehensible. How does this happen? Why is it that the parents shut off the road to happiness for their child—if, in fact, that's so? I have to be convinced of that first."</p><p>"Fine. If you want to be convinced, recall a scene from your own childhood."</p><p>"But that's hard. Not everyone can remember their infancy."</p><p>"Why? Isn't that because your memory, sparing your feelings, cuts off what is fruitless and empty? It tries to do away with any hint of despair and to erase what you experienced in your mother's womb as well. It senses the world's abuse through your mother's sufferings. If you like, shall I help you remember?"</p><p>"Sure, help me. What happened then and slipped from my memory?"</p><p>"You don't want to remember how you, master of the Universe, lay alone and helpless in your crib—swaddled, as if tied up. Smiling, your parents decided for you when you should eat and when you should sleep. You wanted to be thinking everything through and understanding it all. But all too often they tossed you up toward the ceiling, hooting. 'But why?' you barely had time to think. When you grew up a little, you saw many things that did not have words or souls around you, but you weren't allowed to touch them. You could only touch what was offered you. You reconciled yourself to this and tried to make sense of what was good about the toy presented to you. But you couldn't find anything in this absurd primitive thing that wasn't and couldn't be there. Still, you searched. You did not surrender completely. You touched, and you tasted, but in vain. You never did find the answer. That was when the one born to be ruler of the Universe faltered for the first time. You decided that you could not solve anything. You were betrayed by those who gave birth to you, and you betrayed yourself."</p><p>"You're talking about events from my life. Was I any different from other children?"</p><p>"I am speaking specifically about you and about those hearing me at this instant."</p><p>"You mean, there are many rulers of the Universe, if each of us was born that? How can that be? What kind of ruler is it, if many rule one and the same thing? Or should there be many universes?"</p><p>"The Universe is one—unified, indivisible—but each has his own space in it, and the whole depends on each person."</p><p>"So where is it, my space?"</p><p>"Lost. But you will find it."</p><p>"When did I manage to lose it?"</p><p>"When you gave up."</p><p>"What do you mean by 'gave up'? I was like all children."</p><p>"Like all children, believing in the goodness of those close to you—in your parents—you suppressed your desires more and more often, and you agreed that you were still insignificant and little and knew nothing.</p><p>"The sensations born in you by the violence against your childhood have accompanied you all through life, trying to be embodied afterward in your descendants. You went to school, like everyone else. There they told you how man was just an ape, how primitive he was, how he foolishly believed in God, how there was just one leader, who knew everything. His nation chose him. He alone was worthier and smarter than everyone. You enthusiastically recited poems glorifying that leader."</p><p>"I wasn't the only one who glorified whoever they told me to. I myself believed it then."</p><p>"Yes, many people recited poems. They vied with each other to see who glorified him best, and you strove to come in first."</p><p>"Everyone did."</p><p>"Yes, the entire system demanded that each shared the same aspirations. This is how each was violated. This is how the system strove to crush you in order to preserve itself.</p><p>"But after you'd lived part of your life, you suddenly found out that there were many systems and that they varied. Then you found out that man may never have been an ape, and the wisest of leaders was the most foolish of tyrants. You realized your generation had lived its life incorrectly. Now you had to live in another system.</p><p>"You became a parent. Without thinking, you gave your daughter over to the new system, as if to do her good—no longer thinking, as before. Perplexed, you don't shake your rattle. Having admitted the violence, you yourself commit violence against your own offspring. Superseding each other one millennium after the next, the different systems come and go, one after the other. Each has the same goal: to kill you, the ruler, and twist the wisest creator into a soulless slave. The system functions continuously through parents and through those who call themselves the wisest teacher. They formulate new teachings and thus new systems. If you look only a little closer, you can see clearly that it is moved by the same old intent: to separate you from God, to stand between you and God, and to force you to try to live and work for yourself, for you and God. This is the essence of any system, and you, Vladimir, have asked me to create another. I could not satisfy your request. Look around you. Try to comprehend with just your soul."</p><p>"Tell me, Anastasia, what about our son? Living in the wild taiga among the beasts, he hasn't seen even a little violence?"</p><p>"Violence and fear are unknown to him. He is gaining more and confidence that everything is subordinate to man and that man is responsible for everything."</p><p>"But isn't it violence, at least a little, when a bear licks his soiled bottom after his nap? Our son fell on his tummy when the bear licked him. When he started crawling again, she licked him a second time, and he fell again. I could see that he didn't like that washing. That's why he grabbed the bear by the snout, so she would stop pushing him with her tongue."</p><p>"And the bear immediately stopped licking him. A little later, he will understand the significance of this procedure, but right now he takes it for the bear's play. He himself is playing with the bear, and he wants her to chase him."</p><p>"You said man is the wisest in the Universe, but our son is being raised by wild animals. This isn't normal. On television, they told the story of a man who had fallen among wolves as a baby. When he grew up and people caught him and returned him to civilization, he couldn't talk like a human for a long time. He seemed mentally retarded."</p><p>"For our son, all the beasts around are not teachers but good nannies, clever, and sincerely in love with him. There is no doubt they are prepared to give their lives in an instant for their little man."</p><p>"Did it take you long to train them like that? Did your grandfather and great-grandfather help you?"</p><p>"Why train them? The Creator did all this long ago.</p><p>"But how could He predict everything in advance, teach every last animal what to do and at what moment? In the glade, when I was watching our son, he noticed the squirrels and liked one of them. He reached out to it, smiled, and said 'e-e-e-eh.' The squirrel dashed toward him—the very squirrel he had liked. Vladimir played with it, took its paw, and stroked its tail. How could the Creator have predicted that situation and taught the squirrel?"</p><p>"The Creator is wise. He did everything in a much simpler and more brilliant way."</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"Someone who lacks aggression, self-interest, fear, and the many dark thoughts that enter later emanates the Light of Love. It cannot be seen, but it is stronger than the light of the Sun. Its energy is life-giving. The Creator made it so that only man possesses this great ability. Only man! He alone is capable of warming everything alive. This is why everything alive is drawn to him.</p><p>"Our little Vladimir noticed the squirrel, rested his gaze on just one, focused his attention on it, and his warmth went out to that squirrel. It felt the warmth and rushed to the source, and it liked playing with him. Our son can summon any animal this way.</p><p>"Thanks to the Creator, all newborns have these abilities, when they are in a dimension of Love and nothing has yet destroyed this wonderful ability.</p><p>"The dimension of Love originates in the mother's womb and afterward only expands. Only man can spoil or improve the dimension of Love.</p><p>"Here my grandfather was training an eagle. You heard that. In this way, he brought something new into the dimension. From earliest times, my forefathers, my fathers and mothers, have striven to do this. Tomorrow will be an unusual day, and you will see what happens. Tomorrow will be an important day for the future."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0315>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>15. A Bird for Knowing the Soul</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>The next day, when we arrived at the glade, again without being noticed, Anastasia and I observed our young son's engrossing play. The wolf lay at the edge of the glade and watched keenly as well. The wolf's cubs were playing next to it. I noticed that from time to time Vladimir would put his finger in his mouth and suck it, which all babies do for some reason. I knew that parents have to do whatever it takes to distract the child from this habit. Wrap his hands in diapers or put a pacifier in the child's little mouth.</p><p>I told Anastasia this, and she replied, "Don't worry. There is great benefit in this. Our son is licking the pollen from his fingers."</p><p>"Pollen? What kind?"</p><p>"Flower and grass pollen. He is touching the grasses and flowers. Sometimes bugs crawl over his hand, and they have pollen on their feet, too. Look, he frowned and took his finger out of his mouth. That means he didn't like the pollen of some grass. Now he's bowed his head and is trying to put a flower in his mouth and taste it. Let him. Let him taste the Universe."</p><p>"The Universe and a little flower! How do they connect? Or are you just speaking figuratively?"</p><p>"Everything living in the world has a universal connection."</p><p>"But how? Where? Where do you see that connection? What instrument can register it?"</p><p>"No instrument is needed. A soul is. Then you can understand and see what is visible every day, many times every day."</p><p>"What can be seen with the soul and then understood, for example?"</p><p>"Take the Sun. It is far away, a universal planet, and when it rises, its ray touches a flower—and the flower opens joyfully. How far they seem from each other—that huge heavenly body and the very little flower—but they are connected. They cannot get along without each other."</p><p>Suddenly Anastasia fell silent and looked up. So did I, and I saw a large eagle circling above the glade. I'd seen one more or less like that at the zoo. It descended steadily in circles, lower and lower, until it suddenly touched the ground with its talons a couple of meters from the baby, ran a few steps from the flight's inertia, flapped its wings, and stood in the glade, proud.</p><p>The wolf went on the alert. Its fur stood on end, but it did not attack the eagle, which strutted around the glade.</p><p>The baby got all excited. He sat down on his bottom and—the foolish child!—reached out to the frightening bird.</p><p>Stepping slowly on its talons, the eagle came right up to him. Its head with its crooked beak hung over the child's head.</p><p>The child, not sensing any danger at all, began touching the eagle's feathers and talons. He slapped the eagle's chest and smiled.</p><p>The huge beak touched the little head, once, twice, as if it were searching for something in it. Then the eagle suddenly stepped aside from the child, spread its wings, and flapped them, rising slightly above the grass, and came back to earth. The baby reached out to the huge, menacing bird and called it with his sounds: "e-eh," "e-e-e-e-eh."</p><p>And all of a sudden the eagle went past the child, made a running start, and took off. It circled low over the glade, sped downward, and picked up the baby by the shoulders with his talons in flight.</p><p>But its talons did not dig into his body.</p><p>The eagle put their sharp tips under his arms and began circling low over the glade, flapping its wings, trying to rise above the earth with the baby.</p><p>The baby kicked his little legs as they dragged through the grass, sometimes lifting just a little above the earth, his eyes wide and sparkling with excitement. Then—they took off! When they were in sync, when the child's kicking coincided with the eagle flapping its wings, they rose a meter above the grass.</p><p>Gaining height as it circled, the eagle bore the baby, but the baby wasn't crying out, and they were flying, rising together into the blue.</p><p>The eagle had already lifted him to the tops of the tall cedars and was still climbing.</p><p>Struck dumb with surprise, unable to speak, I grabbed Anastasia's hand.</p><p>She looked up, unable to tear her eyes away, and whispered softly to herself, "You are still strong. Wonderful. You may be old, but you are still strong. Your mighty wings. Fly! Fly even higher!"</p><p>And the eagle, carrying the tiny child's little body in its talons, described circles and rose higher and higher into the heavenly blue.</p><p>"Why is this punishment of the child necessary? Why subject him to this danger?" I shouted at Anastasia, as soon as I recovered from my shock.</p><p>"Please don't worry, Vladimir. The eagle's ascent is not as dangerous as the airplane you fly on."</p><p>"What if it lets go of the child high up?"</p><p>"It would never even dream of such a thing. Relax. Don't produce fear or doubt in your thoughts. The eagle's flight bears great significance in awareness for our son. The eagle has lifted our child above our earth."</p><p>"What significance other than superstition? It's certain that man shouldn't interfere in the great creations. Here I agree. That flight was not foreseen. You yourself, your grandfather taught the bird to do that—out of some superstition, more than likely. Why else? The risk makes no sense!"</p><p>"When I was little, I too rose high up with this eagle. I could understand only a little then, but it was very very interesting and unusual. The glade seemed small from high up. And the vast, large Earth appeared. How vivid it all was, and I remembered this unusual experience for a long time, forever. When I was a little older—three already—my great-grandfather asked me this question one day:</p><p>"'Tell me, answer me, Anastasia, do the animals like it when your hand caresses and pets them?'</p><p>'"Yes, all of them. They even wag their tails because they like petting very much. The grasses, the flowers, and the trees all like it, but they don't all have tails to wag and show me how nice it is when my hands pet them.'</p><p>"'You mean everything wants to know your arm's embrace?'</p><p>"'Yes, everything that lives and grows, little and big both.'</p><p>"'Does the big Earth want your petting, too? Did you see the Earth and how big it is?'</p><p>"I have remembered the vivid picture with the eagle since I was a baby. I knew the Earth's size at first hand. So I answered my great-grandfather without hesitation.</p><p>"'The Earth is big, and its edge can't be seen. But if everyone wants petting, that means the Earth does, too. But who can embrace the whole Earth? It's so big that even your arms aren't enough to embrace the whole Earth, Granddad.'</p><p>"My great-grandfather flung his arms out to the sides, looked at them, and confirmed that, agreeing with me.</p><p>"'Yes, even my arms aren't big enough to embrace the whole Earth. But you said the Earth wants petting like everything else?'</p><p>"'Yes, it does. Everyone wants petting from man.'</p><p>"'Anastasia, now you must embrace the whole Earth. Think, how can you do that?' My great-grandfather left.</p><p>"I often thought about how to embrace the Earth. But I could not think of anything. I knew my great-grandfather would not talk to me, I would not hear a question from him, until I was able to solve the problem, so I tried.</p><p>"But more than a month passed. The problem was not getting solved. Then one day I gave the wolf a kindly look, from a distance. It was standing at the other end of the glade.</p><p>"The wolf suddenly wagged its tail under my gaze. Then I began noticing how all the little beasts rejoice when you looked at them with joy and tenderness. How far away or how big they are did not matter. Joy visited them as well from your gaze or when you thought of them with love. I realized they felt just as good as they did before from your hand, when you petted them. Then I also realized . . . There is the me with hands and feet, but there is also a larger me than I can show with my hands. And this large and invisible me is also me. This is how each person is made, as am I. And this greater me could embrace the whole Earth.</p><p>"When my great-grandfather came, I told him, ablaze with joy.</p><p>"'Look, dear Granddad, look. The nice animals rejoice not only when I embrace them with my hand but also when I look at them from far away. My invisible me embraces them, so it can embrace the whole Earth, too.</p><p>"'I will embrace the Earth with my invisible me! I am Anastasia. There is the little me and there is the big me. But I still don't know what to call myself and the other one. But I'll think about the right way to call myself, and when I do, I'll answer everything for you, dear Granddad. Will you talk to me again then?'</p><p>"My great-grandfather spoke to me immediately.</p><p>"'Call the second you your soul, dear. Your soul. Safeguard it and use it, vast as it is.'</p><p>"Vladimir, tell me, how old were you when you first were aware of and sensed your soul?"</p><p>"I don't remember exactly," I replied, and I wondered whether I had ever known my own soul and whether others knew theirs, and at what age and to what degree. Perhaps we simply talk about the soul without feeling ourselves one with it, without thinking about our second, invisible self. How important was it to sense all this, and to what end?</p><p>The point moving up above quickly started getting bigger. The eagle, circling, was descending over the glade. When he was circling below the treetops, I saw the child's flushed little face and his little eyes glittering with excitement. His arms were spread out to the sides and he was moving his little fingers in time with the wing-flapping of this unusual bird. When the little legs touched the earth and started kicking on the grass, the eagle's talons unclenched. The child fell, somersaulted on the grass, and quickly got onto all fours, then sat down and turned his head. He was searching for his new friend.</p><p>Tottering, the eagle walked away from the baby but fell over on its side. About ten meters from the child, the eagle lay rather awkwardly on the grass and had thrown one wing back. It was breathing heavily and its head was bowed toward the grass.</p><p>The baby saw it, smiled, and crawled toward it. The eagle tried to get up to meet the child but once again collapsed on its side. In two leaps the wolf, teeth bared maliciously, was between eagle and baby.</p><p>Anastasia whispered agitatedly, "How perfect and strict are Your laws. You gave man everything from the beginning, Creator. The wolf is obeying your laws, but I feel sad, very sad for the eagle."</p><p>"What's happening? Why is the wolf aggressive and angry?" I asked Anastasia.</p><p>"The wolf won't let the eagle get close to Vladimir now. He thinks the bird is sick, since it's collapsed on its side. He might attack it to drive it from the glade. Vladimir should not see an attack. He wouldn't understand now. Oh dear. . . . What should I do?"</p><p>At this, the eagle suddenly shook its wings, stood firmly on its feet, tossed its head back proudly, and clicked its ominous beak twice. The eagle walked, confident and proud, toward the baby. The wolf seemed to calm down. It stepped aside but did not go far, prepared at any moment to leap. Unblinking, it watched what was happening.</p><p>The child touched the huge bird first on its beak and then started pulling on its wing feathers, smacking its wing, and demanding or asking something, repeating, "E-eh," "a-ah."</p><p>The crooked beak touched the top of the child's head and his shoulders, which had marks from his talons.</p><p>Then bowing his head to the ground, the eagle picked some kind of small flower with its beak and placed it in the child's little mouth, which never closed, like a fledgling's, while producing its sounds. The eagle fed the little person as if he were its own fledgling but once again tottered off. The malicious wolf prepared to leap. Suddenly, the eagle took a running start . . . a flap of its wings . . . liftoff!</p><p>It rose higher and higher and then abruptly went into a power dive toward the glade, pulling up a meter and a half off the ground, leveling off, and soaring up again. The baby waved to it, reached, called out, and laughed with his toothless mouth.</p><p>Anastasia, following the eagle continuously, whispered agitatedly, "There's no need. You did everything well, and you are healthy—I know it. You are not ill. Rest now, rest. Thank you! I believe it. I believe you are healthy! You are just a little old. Rest!"</p><p>The eagle performed its complicated pirouette one more time, and so that his talons plucked some grass, and still it did not stand up, did not push off of the ground, but flapping its wings mightily was able to rise in the air after ripping out a clump of grass with its claws. It made a circle, dropped the grasses on the child, and began climbing higher and higher into the sky. Anastasia continued to follow it steadily. Even when it turned into a dot, she kept watching the eagle. For some reason, I too kept watching as the dot moved away from the glade—at first simply climbing, then turning abruptly to the side, away from the glade. Suddenly the point started toward the ground, and soon it was clear that one or the other wing was being forced open by the wind, not because of the bird's intentional efforts.</p><p>It wasn't flapping its wings or soaring; it was simply falling. Its wings fluttered in the wind and were forced open by the wind.</p><p>Anastasia cried out.</p><p>"You died in the sky, above! And there you remained. You did everything you could for man. Thank you. . . . Thank you for the heights, my old teacher."</p><p>The eagle kept falling and above it, two other young eagles circled.</p><p>"Your fledglings, stronger now. You did everything for their future, too," Anastasia whispered to the old eagle, which fell somewhere beyond the glade, as if it could hear her, dead.</p><p>The two young eagles circled low over the glade. I knew they were its fledglings, and the baby waved to them.</p><p>"That's just great. Why this pointless sacrifice? Why is he like this? All this is for man? Why do they try so hard, Anastasia? Why do they sacrifice themselves like this?"</p><p>"For the light that emanates from man, for the grace that man can give them, and for the hope for their own children. Now the fledglings will see it. They will feel the light of life-giving love coming from a person! Look, Vladimir. Our son is smiling at the eaglets and they are flying toward him. The eagle may have understood that a particle of it would be in this light that comes from man, this light full of grace."</p><p>"They're prepared to sacrifice themselves for the light that comes from all people?"</p><p>"For all people who are capable of emitting a light full of grace!!!"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0316>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>16. System</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>Anastasia left to get ready to feed our son, and I began walking through the forest in contemplation.</p><p>Two things upset me. I found them unpleasant. First, as a father, I had found absolutely no niche in which I could participate in our son's upbringing. It was clear that I wasn't going to find any toys more interesting than what he already had, nor was there any point in bringing him food.</p><p>Mother's milk, fresh flower pollen, and after that nuts and berries. Certainly packaged baby food could not replace natural food. Nevertheless, I had a hard time wrapping my head around the situation.</p><p>Anastasia had nothing, after all, but at the same time she needed nothing and even provided for the child freely.</p><p>Television ads for toys and children's accessories make it seem as though a child can't survive without them, but here they were pointless and, moreover, harmful. The child doesn't even need a crib here. Of course, a child won't freeze even at forty below if its crib is a bear. You don't need to launder sheets or diapers. The bear is clean and tidy, too, and each time rakes her claws through her groin like a comb. She rubs itself prone on the grass and then bathes. She comes out of the water and shakes. Spray flies in all directions. Then the bear lies down on her back, belly up, dries off, and again combs her groin.</p><p>Anastasia led me up to the bear and let me touch the spot where the baby slept. It was soft there, clean and warm.</p><p>But if material provision is not at all needed from me, as the father, I should certainly take part in my child's upbringing. Only how? Should I firmly demand an answer from Anastasia? After all, I met her conditions and didn't pick up the child. I didn't insist that the presents I brought be used.</p><p>My second disappointment was that I now could not satisfy readers' requests and lay out a detailed system for rearing children. The letters contain many questions about children, and at readers' conferences the audience always asks about children. I promised I would question Anastasia about this and would set forth in the next book the system by which her clan has raised children from generation to generation. And there you had it! She rejected any system in general and said furthermore that any system was harmful. That can't be, of course. There has to be at least one correct system among the harmful ones. And then I had an insight. In the readers' letters and at conferences, there hadn't been a single question about raising children addressed to me. Everyone asked Anastasia to answer, and if people trusted her more than our standard specialists—and more than me, naturally—then let her answer the questions they'd raised. It was she who had to do that. My job was to set down her answers in the book. As it was, I had plenty of concerns just with publishing the book.</p><p>Anastasia finished what she was doing and ran up, cheerful, her face flushed.</p><p>"I did everything. Our son is asleep. Were you bored here alone?"</p><p>"I was thinking."</p><p>"What about?"</p><p>"About the fact that there's nothing more to write in a book. I told you that people expect answers to specific questions. People are interested in childrearing. But what can I write about that? I can set out how you are with the child and how he lives. But what of it? In the conditions of our life, these methods are impractical. Not everyone can get a bear and wolf or train an eagle, and no one has a glade with pure pollen on the flowers, like here."</p><p>"But the bear is not the point, Vladimir, or the eagle. They are just a consequence of something more important which will find its way in any conditions."</p><p>"What's that?"</p><p>"The attitude toward the child and the thoughts surrounding the child. Believe and understand me. Christ can be born only by the mother who believes she has given birth to Christ, and if parents would treat their infant as they would Christ or Mohammad, the baby would follow their thought, too. He would try to become like that. People spend time in nature anyway, and whoever can apprehend and sense what the Creator has made, its meaning and purpose, will be able to create a light and happy world for his child."</p><p>"But sense it how? There needs to be some gradual way—a method."</p><p>"The only way to sense it is with your heart. Only the heart can understand."</p><p>"More specifically?"</p><p>"You wrote more specifically when you talked about the summer people, without even noticing it yourself. Anyway, why waste words? If the heart and soul are not open, words only become a slight breeze."</p><p>"Yes, I did write that. However, life hasn't changed."</p><p>"The shoots are barely noticeable, and not to each person right away—especially the shoots that have grown up in the soul."</p><p>"But if they can't be seen, why write? I'm writing, I'm trying. Yet far from everyone believes and understands what you're talking about. Some even doubt your existence."</p><p>"Think about it, Vladimir. Perhaps you can see the meaning in doubts."</p><p>"What meaning can there be in doubts?"</p><p>"Doubts slow resistance, which is why I exist for those I exist. We are together, side by side and in each other's hearts. Think again and you may apprehend it. I exist because they are. Their power is to create, not destroy. They will understand and support you and be by your side in their thoughts."</p><p>"No matter what you say, I'm sick and tired of listening to insults. Dispel the doubts of unbelievers. Go on television and show them what you can do," I asked Anastasia.</p><p>She replied, "Believe me, Vladimir. My flesh and the miracles I create will not shed the light of belief on unbelievers. They will only increase the irritation in those who do not like a world-view other than their own. Don't waste your energy on them. Everything has its turn, its dawn, and if you want, I will appear before people and appear in the flesh. But before that, I must let the woman who has unwillingly devoted her life to the kitchen see other joys as well, and let the light of love shine on the young mama left alone with her child. And the children! Understand, the children! I must put a stop to the violence against their soul from postulates."</p><p>"There you go—again with your dream! It hasn't been long since you dreamed your dream, and a little has been done—a book, pictures, and poems. But where are your global accomplishments for all people? Just don't talk about the light shoots growing in the human soul. Show me something I can actually touch. You can't? You can't!"</p><p>"I can."</p><p>"Then show me!"</p><p>"If I show you, I'll be tempting you to reveal prematurely only the burgeoning shoots, and who will protect them from the hailstorm of evil then?"</p><p>"You will."</p><p>"I would have to, correcting my error. Look."</p><p>Thanks to Anastasia, I had the chance to come into contact with a phenomenon even more unusual and stunning than I described in my previous books. In a single instant, the beautiful faces of people of different ages passed by—whether inside or beside me, I don't know—from various parts of the Earth.</p><p>This wasn't just a flickering. These people appeared as they went about their affairs, which were as beautiful as their faces. I could see their environment, the events occurring to or because of them, over the years of their life. They all lived now, in today's world. It would take many years to review this much information in a movie, but here, a single instant was enough. Once again, before me was Anastasia. She hadn't even changed position. She began speaking as soon as I saw her.</p><p>"Vladimir, did you think that your visions were just some kind of hypnosis? I beg of you not to think about the mystery that helped them appear before you, please. We were talking about children. About the main thing! Did you see any children? Will you tell me?"</p><p>"Yes, I did. Their faces were intelligent and good. The children were building a house themselves, a very handsome, large house. They were also singing as they worked. I saw a gray-haired man among them. He's a scholar, that man. He struck me as very wise, but he spoke oddly. He believes that children might be wiser even than those called scientists. The children treat the scholar both like an equal and, at the same time, with respect. In the vision, there were a lot of children. How oddly they study, and how strange what they dream about. But that is just a vision. What can you say about it? In real life, everything's completely different."</p><p>"You did see real life, Vladimir, and you will soon be convinced of this."</p><p>And indeed, that is exactly what happened. It did happen. I saw it!</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0317>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>17. Bring Back to Life the Vision of Happiness</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>Soon after my return from the taiga, I paid another visit to Gelendzhik for a readers conference on the book. The deputy head of the Krasnodar Region's Gelendzhik District took me to the forest school of the pedagogue Mikhail Petrovich Shchetinin.</p><p>A narrow macadam road led from the highway to the forest and a small valley hidden between the mountains. The road soon gave out at an unusual two-story tower-house, still incomplete. A Russian folk song in children's voices poured from the unframed window openings. This was the house of my forest visions, but now it was absolutely real.</p><p>Without saying anything to anyone, I climbed over various building materials in order to touch this house with my own hands. When I got close I saw a girl of about ten nimbly climb down a ladder, walk up to a pile of river pebbles, and select stones which she put in a sardine tin. She climbed the ladder again, and I climbed after her toward the cascading, alluring singing. On the second floor, other children like her and a little older took the smooth stones from the container and cemented them to the wall, creating amazingly beautiful patterns. Two girls immediately wiped each stone attached to the wall carefully with wet rags. They were engrossed in what they were doing and in their song. There were no adults among them. Later, I learned that the foundation and every brick of this house had been laid by a child's hand. The children themselves had come up with the design and appearance of every corner of this house.</p><p>This was not the only such building in their little school-town. In this remarkable place, the children themselves built their buildings, their town, and their future, and they sang. Here a ten-year-old girl was capable of building a house, drawing magnificently, cooking, and knowing ballroom dances and the skills of Russian hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>The children of the forest school knew Anastasia. They told me about her themselves. Three hundred children from different towns in Russia study at this school.</p><p>At this school they complete the full course of high-school mathematics in one year and study three languages simultaneously. They are not selecting or producing prodigies here. They are simply allowing what is already inside the children to unfold.</p><p>Mikhail Petrovich Shchetinin's school is under the Russian Ministry of Education and is free. The school doesn't advertise, but it has no vacancies. There are twenty-five hundred applications for any place that the moment it opens.</p><p>It is hard to find words to describe the children's faces beaming with happiness. I went to this school immediately after the readers conference in Gelendzhik. I went with a small group of readers who had heard about my upcoming trip.</p><p>Among the readers was the amazing Natalia Sergeyevna Bondarchuk—an actress, film director, and board member of the Roerich Society. Magnificently knowledgeable about esotericism, she spoke at the conference about Roerich and esotericism. She spoke a lot more intelligently than I about Anastasia. Natalia Sergeyevna had her ten-year-old daughter Mashenka with her. After the conference they were supposed to travel to a film festival in Anapa, to join Mashenka's beloved grandmother, the famous actress Inna Makarova. But Mashenka's words rang out like thunder, like a call to insight. "Mama, please, just three little days. Just three! While you're at the festival, make it so I can stay at this school." And pampered Mashenka did stay at the school for three days, to her mother's great amazement, who said sadly, "We clearly are failing to give our children something. Even loving them, we are unconsciously robbing them."</p><p>There was a cameraman with Natalia Sergeyevna, and he filmed the children of the Shchetinin school talking about their interaction with Anastasia and about their understanding of life. I will quote here a conversation with children busy at the house-tower construction site. Natalia Sergeyevna and I asked the children questions.</p><p>"One gets the impression that each brick of your house is filled with light energy of great power."</p><p>"Yes, that's true," an older, red-haired girl replied. "A lot depends on the people who touched them. We did all this with love. We tried through our souls to bring to the future only the good and joyful."</p><p>"Who designed this building, columns, drawings?"</p><p>"This is our joint idea."</p><p>"You mean, everyone working here only seems to do his own job, but in fact this is a shared idea?"</p><p>"Yes, we gather every evening around the fire where we think through and model the coming day. We think of the images there will be in our house.</p><p>"Some of the students here also act as architects, and they elaborate and unify the joint work."</p><p>"What's the inherent image of the building we're all in right now?"</p><p>"The image of Svarga, the heavenly fire principle. You can see that here from the symbols and the stone amulets."</p><p>"Can you pick out a head or leader among you?"</p><p>"We have a director, but mostly it's our shared thought working here—the lava, as we call it."</p><p>"Repeat that. Thought is lava?"</p><p>"Yes, our state, image, desire."</p><p>"Does everyone here work with satisfaction, does everyone smile, do everyone's eyes shine, is everyone cheerful?"</p><p>"Yes, this is our life because we're doing what we want, can, and love to do."</p><p>"You said that each stone has its own pulse—a rhythm, right?"</p><p>"Yes, and it beats once a day."</p><p>"Is it like this for all stones or do some do it twice?"</p><p>"The pulse of all stones beats once a day."</p><p>"Don't you think your house looks like a temple?"</p><p>"A temple isn't a shape, but a state. For instance, cupolas—they only help you enter into a certain state. Form is shaped by emotion. It's no accident the shapes of a cupola and tent came to us—the reach for the sky and the descending Divine Grace."</p><p>"This house, where each stone has been laid by a good hand—can it heal?"</p><p>"Naturally."</p><p>"It really does heal?"</p><p>"Yes, it does."</p><p>I looked more closely at the girls laying out the ornament of river pebbles on the chamber's wall. The girls, who were wearing quite simple, unfashionable clothing, were beautiful in an unusual way, and I thought, "Where will we meet our future wives? On dance floors, at parties, at resorts. We see our future wives made up and stylish, attracting us with their slender legs and charming figures. That's what we marry. Later, when the makeup is washed off, you look, and sitting in front of you is a grumbling hobgoblin who demands your attention and love. What happiness is there in living your whole life with a hobgoblin? What can you talk about with her? Furthermore, she demands material support from you. Oh well, I was unlucky. But maybe that's exactly what we deserve. Of course it is. We have to be complete idiots to marry makeup and long legs! The lucky ones will get these little girls who are creating the wall ornament for wives. They will be able to build a handsome house, cook food with love, know foreign languages, be wise, intelligent, and beautiful when they grow up, and without makeup they will be even more beautiful. Of course, many will want to take a woman like that for a wife, but who will these girls agree to marry?" This was the question I asked the beauties in their simple clothes:</p><p>"Tell me, who would you like to marry? What should your husband be like? What qualities should he have?"</p><p>Without a moment's thought, the first girl replied, "Goodness and patience, and he should be someone who loves his homeland. Someone who has honor and dignity."</p><p>"What do you understand by 'honor'?"</p><p>"For me honor is in a single expression: I have the honor to be a Russian."</p><p>"But what is a Russian?"</p><p>"It is someone who loves his homeland. Above all, it is someone who stands up for his homeland and would never let it down—no matter what the moment, even the most difficult. He considers himself a part of Mother Russia."</p><p>"And will your children live for the homeland?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"That means your husband has to share that with you, right?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The second girl's answer to the question was as follows:</p><p>"He has to be someone capable of giving warmth and light to other people. If that comes from him, then the people around him will feel good, and so will our family. Someone rich in spirit, a healthy spirit, has incomparable wealth."</p><p>While the camera was on, no one asked the littlest girl a question, but later I did.</p><p>She replied, "Maybe all the best ones will be married by the time I grow up, but my husband will still be very nice, good, and happy. I'll make him like that myself. I'll help him like Anastasia does."</p><p>This is when I saw and understood that Anastasia was sharing her abilities with children. Why with the children of Shchetinin's school? Because Mikhail Petrovich Shchetinin is a great wizard who has created and is continuing to create a dimension of Love, which will grow.</p><p>Right now, they're still small, dark blond Anastasias. But they'll grow up! They'll set out over the Earth creating the same kinds of oases until they fill the whole Earth with them.</p><p>As I stood in the second-floor chamber of this unusual house-tower and examined the ornament and drawings done by the children's hands but resembling masterpieces by the great artists, I sensed that I was in the greatest temple, full of the most light, and the most good, on Earth. This was probably because the house, each millimeter of which had been touched with love by a child's hand, was filled with incomparably more light energy than certain temples.</p><p>This got me thinking. Here we are, restoring destroyed temples and monasteries with modern technology and reinforced concrete construction, which is not that hard to do. We come into these temples with a sense of a duty fulfilled and begin asking, "Lord, give us your blessing," but we won't receive a blessing, because at that time God's attention will be devoted to the children building their unusual house-temple. He will worry that it will end in cement for the children, that there won't be enough brick and boards for the floor. And God will bless with love each person who helps them.</p><p>I couldn't resist the temptation to show these small shoots. I couldn't resist doing what Anastasia had feared, and here is what happened.</p><p>I was walking down a path by the kitchen tables that stood outside where children were working and suddenly felt a gentle warmth, as if someone had aimed a heat reflector at me. The warmth resembled what came from Anastasia when she looked and concentrated her gaze. Only this time it was quite weak. Nonetheless, I stopped and looked in the direction it was coming from. An eleven-year-old girl was sitting at the last table picking over rice. She looked at me and smiled. I sat down with her. I was so close to the gaze of her eyes, which burned with a blue light, that I felt even warmer.</p><p>"What's your name?" I asked her.</p><p>"Hello. My name is Nastya, short for Anastasia."</p><p>"So you can warm people with your gaze the way Anastasia does?"</p><p>"You felt it?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Little Nastya possessed Anastasia's ability, albeit not in full, to warm a body with her gaze. Natalia Sergeyevna Bondarchuk walked over and sat at the table and the cameraman turned on his camera. Not at all embarrassed or stopping her work, Nastya started answering questions.</p><p>"Where do you get your knowledge and abilities?"</p><p>"From the stars."</p><p>"What have you realized communicating with the Siberian Anastasia?"</p><p>"It is very important to understand and love your homeland."</p><p>"Why is this very important?"</p><p>"Because the homeland is what our near and distant relatives created."</p><p>"Who are your parents? What does your father do?"</p><p>"My papa is a teacher. It's nice at the school where he teaches, but here is better."</p><p>"You live here like one big happy family. Are you forgetting your own parents?"</p><p>"Just the opposite. We love our parents more and more, and we send them good thoughts so they'll feel good."</p><p>As the camera ran, I very much wanted Nastya to show the skeptics what her warming gaze was.</p><p>I asked her, "Nastya, show all the people how you can warm with your gaze. There's the camera. Look into the lens and warm everyone watching."</p><p>"Everyone at once is very hard. It might not work for me."</p><p>But I kept insisting. I repeated my request, and the same exact thing started happening to Nastya that happened to Anastasia in the forest when by the strength of her will, at a distance, with the help of her ray, she rescued the man and woman from the criminals' torturing. I had described this scene in the first book.</p><p>Anastasia explained then, "This isn't in my power. This was preprogrammed, and not by me, and I can't intervene directly. They're stronger now."</p><p>Nonetheless, when I persisted and repeated my request, she carried it out, even while knowing she might perish.</p><p>After my persistent repeated request, little Nastya tried to carry it out. Two times in a row she took a deep breath and held it, shut her eyes for a while, and then began looking calmly into the camera's lens. The bewitched cameraman fell still. Suddenly, Natalia Sergeyevna Bondarchuk tore off her scarf and covered Nastya with it. She was the first to notice the child's body starting to vibrate and her face turning pale. I realized that I should not have repeated my request. There was no point wasting energy on unbelievers. This would only heighten the malicious opposition in them.</p><p>Adult visitors could not contain their desire to touch the children. They touched, hugged, and petted them like kittens. Why did I bring a whole group of these adults with me? After all, I knew that different kinds of commissions visited this school—delegations at various levels and simply individual people—to look, to satisfy their curiosity, to come in contact with the grace emanating from its residents—to touch and take without offering anything of themselves. Anastasia may have been right when she said, "While trying to take the grace of a holy place, think about what you can leave behind of yourself. If you have not learned how to emit light, why take it and bury it in yourself, as in a grave?" I too had come to this school out of curiosity. Thanks to Anastasia, Mikhail Petrovich Shchetinin had received me. The children had already laid food out on the table and were feeding everyone who had come with me. We did not take only food from the table here. The fire in the children's vibrant little eyes gave us incomparably more, and what did we give them in return? Did we pat them on the head like patrons? I alone in the group, vexed with himself, moved off to one side and thought. All of a sudden Lena and Nastya, whom I already knew, came up and stood next to me.</p><p>"You have to relax," Nastya said softly. "Adults are always like this. They want to pet us and hug us. They think hugging is the main thing. But today you've been nervous since morning. Come to the glade with us and we'll tell you about Anastasia. I know what dimension she's in right now."</p><p>When we arrived at the glade, the cameraman, who had joined us, said, "Let's try to shoot an interview with the girls. There should be excellent footage. Look at the beautiful landscape, and no one is stopping us."</p><p>"Maybe we shouldn't. We've probably already tortured them with all our interrogating."</p><p>"But they'll be happy to talk to you. Visitors and journalists are not often allowed in at the school. But here we have this unique opportunity. It would be a shame to pass it up. Understand me as a professional."</p><p>I picked up the microphone and said to the girls.</p><p>"I need to interview you. I'm going to ask you questions and you answer them, if you don't object."</p><p>"If you need to, ask your questions," Lena answered, and Nastya added, "Of course we'll answer."</p><p>The girls stood side by side, straightened their long, dark blond braids, and looked me in the eye in anticipation of my question.</p><p>After two trite questions, I fell silent, suddenly aware that these kinds of trite, standard questions were asked of them by all the adults who visited, by the members of all the various commissions, and by the journalists. Meanwhile, the children could answer questions on a subject that not every adult would ever think about.</p><p>The Cossack hetman was right when he said, "My son has studied at this school all of three months, but I can already tell that I too need to learn something and quickly. Otherwise, I will look foolish next to him."</p><p>In general, don't we demean our children with silly questions, thereby suggesting to them that they aren't capable of more? I stood silently in front of the girls with the microphone and could tell from their faces that they were worried about me. They realized that I had stumbled and didn't know what to talk to them about.</p><p>Then I confessed and said honestly, "I don't know what to talk about with you, what question to ask."</p><p>At this, a perfectly comic situation came about. The cameraman and I stood there, two grown muzhiks, and before us were two little ones, energetically supporting each other. Without a second thought, they quickly explained to us how to do the interview and how to speak to another person.</p><p>"You have to relax. You have to know how to relax. The main thing is to speak sincerely. Speak about what's necessary, what excites you."</p><p>"Don't think about us. You need to think about the other person when you talk to him, but don't think about us if it's hard for you. Relax."</p><p>"Ask us questions from your heart. We'll be able to answer. Don't think about us."</p><p>"Until you can do that, why don't we tell you something ourselves."</p><p>They were walking across the glade, smiling, touching the grasses and talking. The depth of their knowledge of the universe, the purity emanating from their soul, and their eyes shining with goodness plunged us into a state of calm and confidence. The cameraman shot at a distance, without fussing over the change of plans. Later, I watched the video Natalia Sergeyevna gave me several times. I saw the little, blond-braided, white magi. They'll grow up! There are three hundred of them at this school.</p><p>I'm writing about this school not to try to prove anything to anyone but to gladden the hearts of those who have read my books and have felt and understood Anastasia.</p><p>If what I set out and how I set it out irritates you, you don't have to read it. I've already received plenty of criticism: for my expository style, for my grammatical mistakes, and for my supposedly commercial motives. Nonetheless I'm writing the next book now. If you don't like my books, better not read them. The events in the next book are more intense than in the previous ones, and the style isn't much better. It could wrack your nerves completely.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0318>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>18. Academician Shchetinin</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>Who is he? We usually explain who someone is by laying out his biography and his service record and titles, but in this case, doing so makes no sense. The Bible says, "You will know them by their fruits." The fruits of Shchetinin are the children's faces beaming with happiness and the faces of the parents of the children studying at this school. So who is he then?</p><p>Natalia Sergeyevna Bondarchuk, not only a distinguished artist of Russia but also a board member of the Roerich International Center (a UN nongovernmental organization), said, "I have met many well-known advocates and teachers from various countries in the world, but nowhere have I been struck to the same degree as here. Here we may have come in contact with the great Sorcerer, but a sorcerer not because he knows the ancient Vedas. He knows what many of us do not."</p><p>I, too, would like to give my impression from my meetings with Mikhail Petrovich Shchetinin. However, I'm not an education specialist, and my definitions will be imprecise. Therefore, I will try to convey without distortion what he himself said.</p><p>Natalia Sergeyevna, her cameraman, Mikhail Petrovich, and I were walking down the school corridor. In a large room not separated from the corridor by a wall, children of various ages sat around tables. They were all engrossed in something incomprehensible, and neither we nor the camera distracted them. Some of the children would get up occasionally, go out somewhere, and return. Sometimes they would walk up to racks with numbers hanging on the wall, or they might take a contemplative walk around the room. Some engaged in discussion, trying to prove or explain something to each other.</p><p>"Mikhail Petrovich, what's going on here?" Natalia Sergeyevna asked.</p><p>"Here you see basically an attempt to connect. If a connection does occur, the children can master the course of mathematics through high school in less than a year. That is their objective. This happens to the students who can connect with those who have this knowledge. What is important is how open their relations are. Their field-structured frames can download information from each other. Love at first sight, when people who love each other are on the same wavelength, is a well-known phenomenon. You haven't said anything yet, but he already understands. You see that everything is done here to set the children at liberty, free. Here they can calmly ask any question, stand up, go in. It is important to maintain relations.</p><p>"It is very important for a child to work on relations, and the same goes for whoever organizes the process. This is why we take our foot off the brake. As you see, we don't emphasize age. Ten-year-old Masha here is sitting next to fifteen-year-old Ivan Alexandrovich. Also here is a university student, Sergei Alexandrovich, although this year he will finish university."</p><p>"How old is the student finishing up university?"</p><p>"This year Sergei Alexandrovich will be eighteen."</p><p>"So he's graduating from the university at seventeen?"</p><p>"He's seventeen in this tribe, but we try not to use the concept of age. This is very important. Notice that here the teacher blends in with the pupils. True, this is a special group. Those who couldn't take part in constructing the buildings are here. Their objective is to master the course in mathematics through high school in order to convey their knowledge to those working now on the construction. This will happen, because they have engendered a system of intercoordinated integration elements.</p><p>"Our ancestral memory knows the structure of the cosmos and the ways of life in the cosmic dimension. Therefore, it is very important to block the notion that the children don't know something. If one of those explaining allows himself this thought, his pupils are not going to know. The main thing for the explainer is to enter into a relation with the pupil for solving the problem, and then the teaching will take care of itself, in order to focus attention on learning and memorization. Get rid of the notion that someone is teaching. By cooperating, they cease to feel that one of them is the pupil and one the teacher.</p><p>"To solve problems, essential knowledge is acquired, but in fact what is happening is remembering something forgotten. This is the reflex arch from Pavlov. You'll remember: stimulus—reaction. If there is a need, I decide.</p><p>"It is very important that what they do directly relates to the people around them. Right now, they are not studying for themselves, and this is very important. Instead, they are concerned with conveying what they have learned to others. The grade is not important for them. They realize that in a few days they are going to have to explain everything to the others.</p><p>
"They are charged with the beginning of the learning process. A group is chosen for each. He observes how those to whom he is supposed to convey his knowledge work on the site, and he makes sure that his group doesn't fall behind the others. The motive—serving another person—has great significance. If they are studying anything, then it is to understand the soul, aspirations, and thoughts of another person. It's not the mathematics that's important here, but the person grasping the mathematics—not mathematics for its own sake, but mathematics for the sake of moving toward the Truth. The larger the 'for the sake of what' motive, the more successful the process of advancement in a field of knowledge.</p><p>"It is important to be in an atmosphere of sincerity, and there should be no insults or irritations. There is no such word here as 'wrong.' In the ancient Russian language there is no stopping of movement, no bad words. The ancient people of all nations do not mark any phenomenon with a bad word. It doesn't exist, there is no need to record it. The bad does not exist. If a group reaches an impasse, then they emphasize words about getting out of the impasse: turn right, left, go up, a suggestion of which way to go, and not a statement: You're in the wrong place. Today Russophobes blaspheme when they say, 'Express yourself in Russian,' by which they mean that obscene expressions are not Russian. Kobzev expresses this thought very accurately:</p><p>Our ancestors, the Slavs,</p><p>amid matters of great import</p><p>ever held utterances, speech</p><p>in special esteem.</p><p>"This is true. For those who work with us, the verbal range has to be deep, excluding random words that distract. Words warmed by feeling have great significance.</p><p>"The truth and the legacy are the spiritual. A child must subscribe to the natural cosmic process of eternal self-reproduction. Then you have given the child eternity, joy of life, true existence—not transitory forms. 'Here, son, I bought you a shirt, pants, shoes. . . . Now I can die.' But what have you given your son? After all, your gifts last only one season. If only you had given your son your worthy name, your honor, your cause, your friends, a flourishing nation! When you have given him an understanding of the Truth of existence and a life of wisdom, then you can say, 'Son, I have given you the most important thing, and you will be happy. You will buy shirts and build houses. You now know how this is done.'"</p><p>Listening to Shchetinin's statements and observing his interactions with the children, I noticed that they were similar to what Anastasia had said about children, and I was amazed. How could a solitary hermit in the Siberian taiga and this gray-haired academician be thinking identically or nearly identically? Why is he talking to me at all? Why did he receive me so warmly, lay his table, feed me, take me around the school and show me everything? Why? Who am I when it comes to pedagogy? No one. A former mediocre student. But naturally, once again she has made an effort."</p><p>Of course, I ended up at Academician Shchetinin's school thanks to none other than Anastasia. But Shchetinin and I didn't talk about her. We talked about all kinds of ordinary topics, and every time I visited, we went to see how construction was going on the unusual house-temple. About my book he said briefly, "This is a very accurate book." That was it.</p><p>A few days after I had been at the school with the group of people from the conference, showed them Nastya, and asked her to warm them all with her gaze, the following happened. Mikhail Petrovich and I were walking down the school corridor, and I was looking for her, searching the way everyone intuitively searches for whatever emits light.</p><p>"Nastya has gone out," Shchetinin said suddenly. "I'm trying to restore her strength now. It's working, but it's hard. Restoring it takes time."</p><p>"What do you mean gone out? Why? She's strong. What happened?"</p><p>"Yes, she is strong. But the emotional outburst on her part was very powerful.</p><p>I was standing in Shchetinin's office, angry and irritated at myself. Why did I insist? Who was I trying to please by proving this? After all, Anastasia had said, "My flesh and the miracles I create will not shed the light of belief on unbelievers. They will only increase the irritation in those who do not like a world-view other than their own."</p><p>"That's it! Enough," I thought. "I'm not going to try to prove anything anymore or write anything. Enough! I'm done writing."</p><p>I thought this to myself, but Shchetinin suddenly said, "You mustn't stop writing, Vladimir."</p><p>Then he walked up to me, put his hand on my shoulder, and looking into my eyes began to sing. The gray-haired academic hit high notes, but more amazing was the fact that he was singing a melody similar to the one Anastasia had sung in the taiga.</p><p>Heading toward the school entrance, in the hall where the children were moving to and fro, I saw Nastya sitting on a chair and went up to her. She stood up, raised her head, and in an instant her slightly weary eyes began to shine, bestowing light and warmth. I immediately realized that she was giving out her energy and warmth and would give it all, sparing nothing, in order to help the other, Siberian Anastasia and her dream, which had now become their shared dream. What on earth was going on? What was the power of this dream? What were they for? . . . With total devotion. . . . And this childish gaze . . . Is one life enough to be worthy, even partly, of such a gaze?</p><p>I said to her, "Well, hello, Nastya," but to myself: "You mustn't, Nastya. Thank you! Forgive me."</p><p>"I'll see you out," she said. "Lena and I will see you to your car."</p><p>Until the car made a turn, I watched the small, diminishing little figures standing at the head of the drive, by the house-tower, under a streetlamp. They did not wave in farewell. Each was holding one arm up, her palm directed toward the receding car. I knew because Shchetinin had explained this to me before. This gesture meant, "We are sending you our rays of goodness. May they be with you wherever you are." Once again came the all-consuming thought: "What do I need to do to become someone worthy of your rays?"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0319>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>19. What to Agree With, What to Believe?</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>My meeting with the pedagogue Mikhail Petrovich Shchetinin and my acquaintanceship with his amazing school took place after my second visit to Anastasia. After my visit to his school, I had practically no more doubts regarding Anastasia's views on childrearing with respect to her interactions with our son. At the time in the taiga, though, everything in me rose up against her. I didn't want to believe her. Or at least, I didn't want to believe everything.</p><p>I'm writing these lines and imagining many of those reading them saying—some out loud, some under their breath, "How long can he go on not believing? After all, he has had occasion to be convinced that she's right many times, and nonetheless, like a moron, he can't accept a new phenomenon."</p><p>My daughter Polina was sent the video from the readers' conference, and I watched a scholar from Novosibirsk by the name of Speransky say directly from the stage, "Megre cannot fully grasp what Anastasia is saying. He doesn't have what it takes to grasp something like that."</p><p>I'm not insulted. On the contrary, everything he said was very interesting. The audience listened with bated breath, and thanks to him I was able to grasp that Anastasia is Essence, a self-sufficient substance.</p><p>What's there to say about me? I've always done something else, but why were those fascinated by science silent about the Earth and children, or at least they spoke softly, practically squeaking? Even children write in their letters to me to pay more attention to what Anastasia says and does.</p><p>But I assure you, esteemed readers, I now treat her much more attentively. However I can't help but argue with her and doubt. I can't because I don't want to feel as if I and our entire society are total idiots. I don't want to believe that we are following the path of degenerates.</p><p>This is why I keep trying to find some justification for our actions, or some reason why her world-views don't fit our contemporary world. I will keep trying to do this as long as there's strength in me. After all, if I don't, I will have to admit not only the truth of what she says but also the horrifying situation in which you and I find ourselves today. If we admit hell's existence, then we ourselves are building the road to hell. Let's take just childrearing. I will talk about myself, although this concerns everyone like me, and I think there are many of them.</p><p>I was a mediocre student, and my father punished me for every bad grade. He punished me not only by forbidding me to go around with my buddies or to buy another toy, but more harshly. There was also fear—fear greater than a blow of his belt. I was constantly afraid of something greater. I would go to the blackboard as if it were the gallows. I've torn pages out of my school record book.</p><p>School years are marvelous,</p><p>With book, notebook, song,</p><p>How quickly they fly by,</p><p>You can't bring them back.</p><p>Do they really fly by without a trace?</p><p>No, no one will ever forget</p><p>Their school years.</p><p>Do you remember the song that says how marvelous our school years were? But let's remember, especially those of us mediocre students—the majority after all—the joy with which we flung our detested book bag as far away as possible when vacation began.</p><p>How can school years be marvelous for a child for whom movement is physiologically essential, but whom they order to sit almost without moving for a full forty-five minutes, in a strictly prescribed pose, both hands resting on his desk? Someone phlegmatic and sluggish can withstand that, but what about someone by nature mobile, temperamental, and impulsive? How is it for him? Nevertheless, everyone is treated alike, like robots, without distinction: sit, or else.</p><p>The little person sits and tries to last for forty-five minutes, but after a ten-minute break there are another forty-five minutes, and so on for a month, a year, ten years. His only choice is to make peace with it, but most of all, to make peace with the fact that he's going to have to make peace with something his whole life. He has to live the way he should, marry the way he should, go to war, since that's the way things are, and unswervingly believe what he's told.</p><p>It's easy to control those who agree to make their peace. Of course, it's good for them to be physically healthy, for various jobs. But they start drinking and using drugs. However, doesn't a person drink and become a drug addict because he's trying to break out, if only for a moment, of the cage of universal subordination to something his soul and heart can't understand? The school years do not fly by quickly. They drag on in forty-five-minute installments of torture.</p><p>Our forefathers, grandfathers, and fathers believed, as we do now, that this is how it should be, that the child doesn't understand. The violence against him is for his own good. Consequently, our children—the Vanechkas, Kolyas, Sashas, and Mashenkas—also go to school, and today, like our ancestors ages ago, we too believe that we are sending them for their own good, that they are there to seek knowledge and Truth. Let's think about this.</p><p>Let's recall our prerevolutionary period. As children, our great-grandfathers sat at their desks. They were taught Divine law, history, and how people are supposed to live. The strict teacher takes his ruler and for their own good strikes those who haven't memorized and those who don't want to perceive the world-view as presented.</p><p>Then came the revolution, and in an instant, adults admitted that the schools had filled children with terrible rot. They cast out all the old from the classrooms and instilled the children with the new: Divine law is utter nonsense. Man developed from the ape. Wear a red tie, line up, recite poems, and praise communism, over and over. So the Pioneers praised and recited, at the top of their lungs, and honored adults. "Thank you for our happy childhood, oh, native land." Once again, those who did not try hard enough were deprived, beaten, and publicly condemned.</p><p>Suddenly, in our age, before our eyes, new directives were handed down. Throw out the ties. We'd been struck by a red plague. Communism is utter terror and hypocrisy. Man developed from the ape? That is stark raving madness. We were born from someone else. The market! Democracy! There's the Truth!</p><p>The distinction between Truth and false dogma is not entirely clear. But children are back to sitting at their desks without budging, and the strict teacher stands at the blackboard.</p><p>Children have suffered from spiritual sadism for centuries—as if a fierce beast, invisible and terrible, were trying to drive everyone born back into some mysterious cage as quickly as possible. The beast has loyal soldiers. Who are they? Who spiritually mocks each child as it comes into this world? What is their name? What is their profession? Should we simply believe that their name is schoolteacher or parent? Even educated parent? I can't believe this right off. What about you?</p><p>Today, teachers are not paid on time, and they strike: "We aren't going to teach the children." Tell me: is it good or bad when a person is not paid? Of course it's bad. A person has to live on something, after all. But what if the strikers include true spiritual sadists? Tell me, is it good or bad that those who humiliate your child don't get paid?</p><p>Generally speaking, the teachers' strikes have led me to some interesting thoughts. Private schools have sprung up in the big cities, and the organizers of these schools have culled the most gifted teachers and pay them a decent salary—about twice the usual. Not every parent can put their child in a school like that, even if he can pay the tuition, because there aren't enough schools like that. And why not?</p><p>The reason is simple: there aren't enough good teachers. The organizers can't find them.</p><p>If teachers can't be found even for a good salary, who is striking? You have to believe me that in no way do I want to single out certain teachers from the full cross-section of our society. In speaking about them, I have myself in mind as well. After all, I am among them. I am a parent, and I forced my daughter to study what they were teaching her in school. Later, at the beginning of perestroika, I asked, "What is your history teacher telling you these days?" She replied, "The teacher talks but it's as if he's not saying anything." What could I tell my daughter? Here is what I did say: "All right, that's enough philosophy. You just study."</p><p>Now we have strikes, but only of teachers? Doctors are striking, as well as miners and scientists. The strikers write on their signs, "The government must go, the president must go!" Those who are striking believe it's all logical. No salary means that the regime hasn't met its obligations.</p><p>Today, such demands seem logical, but what about tomorrow? That's another question. Tomorrow it might turn out that the government and president were standing on the side of light, to save the Earth from invaders and vampires. They may have had no inkling of this themselves, under the hail of ill-wishers, risking their power, but they were not giving money to sadists, the destroyers of human souls and flesh and the Earth. And they looked like hysterics before all the martyrs.</p><p>Martyrs today, from the standpoints and assumptions of today. Tomorrow, though, new postulates will come, and who will look like what is as yet unclear.</p><p>Anastasia says, "Each chooses his own wrong path. Retribution always comes not later but in this life. With each new day, with each sunrise, it is given for each to grasp the truth of his path, and you are given a choice! You are free to choose where to go. You are a human being! Understand your essence. You are a human being born to live in paradise.</p><p>I ask, "Where is Paradise? Who led us into this swamp?"</p><p>She replied, "Man creates everything for himself."</p><p>You must understand what she is also saying. She is asserting that the time has come to accelerate certain universal processes. Those whose way of life does not correspond to the natural laws of being will be subjected to trials—first in the most ordinary way, understandable and obvious. These trials for them are like a good signal for understanding their deeds and path. Those who cannot grasp this will know more misery, and then they will have to leave life so that they can be reborn healthy in ten thousand years.</p><p>It turns out, according to her, that the miners who tore at the Earth's veins, the doctors of modern medicine who invaded genetic engineering, and the scientists who invented the technology of death have already received their first signal: society rejects them and they are experiencing material dissatisfaction. Those who have material goods today suffer even more from moral dissatisfactions, subconsciously aware that their activities do harm rather than good. I tried to object, explaining that coal was needed for factories, but she said, "Which factories? The ones that smoke, burn the air intended for people to breathe, and pour the metal to make submachine guns and bullets?"</p><p>In other words, she asserts that the system we have created of artificial life support is so imperfect that all its accomplishments are on the verge of cataclysm.</p><p>Under big cities, they have replaced natural underground rivers and pure springs flowing from the depths with a system of pipes and faucets that cannot renew themselves and will eventually decay, and that carry this decay in the water to the faucets for each of us.</p><p>Anastasia also says, "The time will come when humanity will understand. The greatest scientist will go to see the grandmother in her garden. Starving, he will ask her for a tomato for nourishment. That grandmother does not need the scientist and his fleeting creations today. She neither knows nor wants to know about them. She lives peacefully without the scientist. But he cannot survive without her. He is in an illusory, barren world that leads nowhere. She is with the natural land and the entire Universe. The Universe needs her, not him."</p><p>I tried to object, saying that if we didn't produce weapons but only worked the land, we would become weak. Technologically developed powers that did have weapons would easily conquer us.</p><p>"They will have a problem protecting themselves from their own weapons and the social cataclysms they engender.</p><p>"Yes, they will abandon it all. They will run to the vegetable gardens with their submachine guns, to our peasant women, your summer people, but the women won't have submachine guns to repulse them."</p><p>"But will they ever get that far? What do you think? Won't they fight each other over the peasant women?"</p><p>In the end, if you don't argue with Anastasia, if you treat what she says with trust, then you have to admit you're a total idiot, the worm in the apple. No one wants to admit that!</p><p>So while understanding perhaps not everything in Anastasia but at least something, I try to justify what we have created. If I can't find sensible justifications and must admit the insolvency of our path, what then? Let's give this some thought. Should we let children grow up without our social and cultural postulates? Should we ask children where and how we should proceed?</p><p>Anastasia talks about how children we don't spiritually cripple will find an opportunity to save both themselves and us, or rather, to regain the paradise originally given us.</p><p>Everything is and isn't simple in our world, it turns out. Tell me why, why not disseminate the experience of Shchetinin's school? Why not have at least one such school in every provincial seat? It turns out not to be that simple. I asked Shchetinin to make such a school in Novosibirsk. He gave his consent. But who would help with the building? That is a question.</p><p>I asked Shchetinin, "What if people are found in other cities and they organize a base. Could you put at least one school like this in each of the different cities?"</p><p>"You can't solve everything right away like that, Vladimir."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"We won't find that many teachers for the school."</p><p>Again that thought. What is this business about no teachers? Who's striking then?</p><p>Academician Shchetinin's school is public, not private. It's a free school of the Russian Ministry of Education. But why is it in the mountains, in a gorge? Why? And why did somebody try to shoot Shchetinin? Why was his brother killed? Why are the Cossacks helping protect it? Who hates it that much? Whom does it bother?</p><p>I was invited to the State Duma's Education Committee. They had read Anastasia and The Ringing Cedars of Russia. In both the State Duma and the Education Committee, there were people who shared and understood what Anastasia had said. Good people. I told them about Shchetinin, and they knew him well and spoke of him with respect.</p><p>"Then what's the matter?" I asked. "Why has nothing changed in the country's education? Children continue to suffer, go to the blackboard as if to the gallows, and sit at their desks without moving.</p><p>The answer saddened me. Unfortunately, it's tragic for those who are still children today. It's a paradox, but it is the teachers themselves who have become the insurmountable obstacle, as I understood when I heard this sad response:</p><p>"Tell us, what are we supposed to do with the heap of academic titles, degrees, and innumerable dissertations on child education? What are we supposed to do with the scientific institutions? After all, these people developed the system. The machine has been set in motion, and it's not that simple to stop that flywheel instantly. Every dissertation candidate, to say nothing of those with the title of professor, mans the ramparts to defend his views."</p><p>I also learned how, after visiting Shchetinin's school, a woman deputy from our Duma fretted: "Everything about that school was incomprehensible to me. It's so unusual, it looks like a sect."</p><p>I didn't know what "sect" meant specifically. Later I found a dictionary and looked it up.</p><p>The dictionary defines the term thus:</p><p>Sect [from the Lat. Secta-teaching, direction, school].</p><p>1. A religious community or group that has split off from the dominant church.</p><p>2. A separate group of individuals closed off in their narrow group interests.</p><p> </p><p>I don't understand what the deputy meant by this word, but I don't think either definition fits Shchetinin's school very well. Furthermore, if it's split itself off, then from the good or the bad? I believe it has split off from the sadistic treatment of children. As for a Duma whose deputies make statements like that, I have nothing to say. Let readers see how well this definition suits certain Duma factions: "A separate group of individuals closed off in their narrow group interests." A sect?</p><p>Shchetinin was shot at. But he's a grown man. The Cossacks may be able to help somehow, and Anastasia said she would protect the new shoots. Now I understand. She's better off not leaving her taiga for now. If she were a little more aggressive, she would strike her ray at all the dissertations, titles, and rot. But no. We have to go easy, she says, and change consciousness</p><p>Consequently, I've written what I myself thought about raising children and about modern schools, but my position has probably come out muddled and rather insincere. For one thing, in general I would like to write about our schools with Russian obscenities, but my prose style is rather new—since my contact with Anastasia. Not all words fit it.</p><p>I would also like to tell teachers—all those who have managed, even despite the system, to give the child at least a little bit of good and, as Shchetinin says, "join the natural cosmic process"—Thank you! I bow to you.</p><p>From what Anastasia has said about raising children, I also understand that the awareness of the child as an individual comes first. Compared to adults, the child is physically weaker, of course, but immeasurably better. He is immaculate and not constrained by postulates. Before stuffing his head with all kinds of maxims and admonitions, we ourselves should understand something about the world, if only for ourselves. Think for ourselves! Forget alien postulates for a while.</p><p>In each town, we entrepreneurs will have to seek out teachers ourselves, help create a school base, and there teach our own children and grandchildren.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0320>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>20. On Channelers</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>My stay in the taiga passes from one day to the next and I still can't find any occupation for myself. Anastasia runs off somewhere, busy with her affairs. My son, although he's still so little, is getting along beautifully with the help of his wild nannies. It's a strange business, as if humanity had devised so much just to keep busy. Here, you walk through the forest and just think. So here I am, walking through the forest and thinking. I come to the lake again and sit down at my favorite spot, under a cedar. I look at the sack of readers' letters and think, "I mustn't forget to have Anastasia answer all their questions."</p><p>As soon as she walked up, I immediately said, "Do you see the letters from readers? I've sorted them all by question: about childrearing, various proposals, about religions, about Russia's destiny, about wars, poems and good wishes, and letters from channelers. You see?"</p><p>"Yes, I see."</p><p>I first asked Anastasia about channelers.</p><p>"There are people who say—just look at what they write in their letters. They claim contact with extraterrestrial civilizations and with certain individuals from the past. They hear different voices. Some people write down what they hear and assert that these are messages conveyed to them by the Universe's Supreme Intellect. Our presses publish books in large print runs about channeling. For instance, there's a woman writer, Blavatsky, author of several fat books, and the Roerichs, widely known, who also wrote books and painted pictures. They are read in many countries, and their paintings are exhibited. Other people are fearful and frightened when they hear a voice. Look, here's a letter from a girl in Klintsy. A voice is telling her she should listen to it, because it's a wise teacher, but the girl is afraid and is asking you for help. Are these readers really in contact with someone? How does this happen?"</p><p>"What do you think an extraterrestrial civilization is, Vladimir?"</p><p>"The population of some other planet, star, or something invisible living nearby. If they're in contact with individuals who lived before, that means these individuals are living in some invisible world."</p><p>"Vladimir, each person is made in such a way that he has access to the entire Universe, both the visible and the invisible one. Each person can interact with anyone or anything he wants.</p><p>The interaction occurs more or less as it would through your radio. Lots of stations broadcast all kinds of information, but the radio's owner chooses what of all that he wants to listen to.</p><p>A person is simultaneously both the radio and its owner. Which station, which source finds its own in him, depends on his consciousness, feelings, and purity. As a rule, that information comes to the specific person who can apprehend, understand, and use it. Everything has to come about calmly, without any importunate stress on personal greatness.</p><p>"When people tell someone about their own greatness, they are trying to act on his egoism: I am so great that I've chosen you alone out of everyone else, and you will be my pupil and you too will rise above everyone. As a rule, inferior, soulless creations say things like that. They cannot be in the flesh, so they strive to crowd out the human soul and take over someone else's flesh. They act on the person's intellect, egoism, and fear of the unknown."</p><p>"But how do you get rid of them? Many readers want to know."</p><p>"Simple. They themselves are cowardly and primitive. They need to be warned: 'Go away, and if you don't I will scorch you with my thought.' They know full well that man's thought is many times more powerful than they.</p><p>"You can also chew a leaf of celandine. First place the leaf on your palm and mentally say to it, 'Rid me of all impurities, leaf.'"</p><p>"But what if many people themselves want to speak to the same source? What should they do? Look, in their letters they write that they're talking to you. Is that true? If so, how do you have time to answer them all? There are lots of them, and they all say they speak directly to you and you answer them."</p><p>"Each reproduces his own thoughts. And each person's thoughts live, they do not vanish into nowhere.</p><p>"What you and I have thought is also in space, my dream is in space with my thoughts. Each person can hear them if he wants. Many can listen simultaneously, the only question is what distortions the radio is capable of letting through."</p><p>"What do you mean by distortions? What do they depend on?"</p><p>"On the purity of the receiver. Imagine you're listening to a speech over an ordinary radio, Vladimir, but instead of distinct words, static breaks in. Some words are unknown to you, and the concepts behind them are unclear. What would you do in that case?"</p><p>"Try to guess the words, to fill in the parts I didn't understand."</p><p>"Naturally. But the word you insert could reduce or change the thought expressed or turn it around. Only your own purity can hear the Truth without distortion, and if it is insufficient—your mood and purity—then you should not blame the source.</p><p>"In material life, in your world, there are many sources to be heard on all sides. They lay claim to the Truth and to the right to master your mind and will, to direct your life for their own benefit. You are free to listen to them or not. You are free to decide for yourself, and you should not blame anyone."</p><p>"Let's say that's so. What if some question is heard and there is no thought in the whole Universe to answer it? For example, people ask you a question, but no thought of yours exists in space to answer it. What happens then?"</p><p>"A question that has no answer in the Universe instantly accelerates advancement in everything. Like a bright flash, like a ringing, it will reach every corner, everything will go into motion, there will be a union of opposites, the answer will be born, and people will hear it."</p><p>"You mean, immediately you personally will directly hear the question and see who asked it?"</p><p>"Like everyone, I too will hear it instantaneously. Unfortunately, people have been asking identical questions for millennia, and there are answers, but few to hear."</p><p>"Still, how do we make sense of this? When does the source bear the Truth, or rather, when is it perceived without static? After all, there's no crackling in our ears when we hear something from without. You say the answer is born as if in the form of one's own thoughts, produced by oneself. But what can we use to figure out if it's a voice for good or not? After all, quite a few hear voices and believe that they are hearing only the Supreme Intellect."</p><p>"When you hear not just the word inside you. When suddenly a feeling flares up, the soul's emotions, and tears of joy in your eyes. When sensations of warmth, smells, and sounds are born in you. When there is a surge, a need for creation, you will also feel inside a thirst for purification. You will be certain you are clearly hearing the thoughts of Light.</p><p>"When cold information comes to you, an order or decree, even if it speaks about good, even if it seems wise—even very wise—and the source sending it forth appears supreme and mighty, know that what is not good does not hide behind good but trains itself to follow you for the good of the essence that has not been given perfect embodiment."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0321>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>21. Everyone Into the Forest?</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>"Anastasia, here is yet another problem. Some readers want to live in the taiga the way you do. Some are trying to find you and are asking you for directions. Others want to organize settlements in the taiga. They draft proposals which they send to the Moscow center wanting to know how they can realize their ideas. I've read of settlements already in the world when people from the cities leave their homes and establish communes in nature. India has settlements like that, as do American and Russia, in Krasnoyarsk District, for example. People want you to tell them the best way for them to carry out their ideas."</p><p>"Why go somewhere else to live?"</p><p>"What do you mean why? People leave the dirty cities, where the air is bad and there's all kinds of noise and bustle. They resettle in clean, ecologically pure places so that they themselves can be purer."</p><p>"Who's left to clean up the mess? Others?"</p><p>"I don't know who. But is it really so bad when a person gets the desire to live in a pure place in nature?"</p><p>"The desire is good. The issue lies elsewhere. When someone who has created dirt around himself comes to a clean place, he brings his dirt with him. First, clean up your own mess, and in this way you will wash away your own sins."</p><p>"So it all has to start with cleaning up. How do you think this will all come about?"</p><p>"Consciousness will serve as the beginning of everything. The aspiration of thought will find the optimal route like a river.</p><p>"In Russia today, that is how everything is happening. You must look closely, Vladimir. It is not in vain, it did not just happen, it is no accident that the factories with fuming smokestacks have been idled today.</p><p>"Fewer and fewer funds are being found in the country for the army.</p><p>"But most importantly, you have stopped regarding as heroes those who have polluted the Earth with their actions and whom it would be no sin to call vandals.</p><p>"You don't need to go into the forest. The forest will cautiously accept whoever comes and will spend a long time studying his intentions, habits, and way of life. After all, where you lived—where you now live—was once forest, too, cultivated by the Creator. What has this salutary, heavenly oasis been transformed into today?</p><p>"Someone who goes into the forest to live is no more important than those summer people who have cultivated gardens with their own hand on vacant, untended land—quite the contrary, in fact. Each blade of grass in their garden knows and loves them and tries to give back universal warmth. Sincere feelings are in those who themselves erected this oasis of paradise, who embodied their soul's good amid the fuss and gloom of death."</p><p>"What will happen to the cities then? Who will maintain them in a normal condition? After all, everything in the cities will collapse, decay, and fall apart."</p><p>"Nor is an abrupt transition permissible from one to the other. Calm movement is essential, and it is going on right now. It is wonderful, and in the future it will be even more wonderful."</p><p>"Well, Anastasia, you're in your usual vein. As before, all summer people are your idols. Only they say almost nothing about the spiritual, as many different associations and religious communes do."</p><p>"What are words when their affairs are truly holy?"</p><p>"Here are some more letters. One person has already sent five. He says he hears a voice. An antenna is telling him that you are summoning him to the taiga, and he is anxious to join you. He threatens me in his letters that he will come to see Solntsev at the Moscow center. He says we are hiding you away from everyone and demands that we arrange a trip to the taiga for him to see you. He is not the only one like this. What do you say to them in reply? I think you know they're in love with you. They believe that they must do good deeds with you and live with you in the taiga."</p><p>"I reply to everyone who is sincere, thank you for your love. But I have not summoned anyone to the taiga. What would you do here? What would you bring? If your intentions are good, let them be embodied where you live. Let love shine on those living next to you."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0322>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>22. On the "Anastasia" Centres</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>"In the cities of Russia and abroad as well, people have already started to organize centers that they name after you. Just listen and I'll read you just one such letter. They write lots of letters like this to my daughter Polina. She herself replies to some; others she forwards to me. But I can't answer them all, and I don't quite know how to treat some of them. After all, there are people who consider these centers a sect. Just listen, here is one letter from the center. What would you yourself say to this?"</p><p>I read Anastasia one letter in full out of those which Polina had forwarded to me.</p><p>Dear Polina,</p><p>I am Valery Anatolievich Karasev, an associate of our school's Anastasia Ecological Center.</p><p>Our Center is very young. It was formed on 4 December 1997, and is now in the process of coming into its own. Its birth was facilitated by your father's book, for which we are all very grateful.</p><p>Like a ray of the Light in a dark kingdom, Anastasia is now uniting the creative forces of adults and children who have not lost the ability to create, to defend their honor and dignity, who strive toward light ideals and believe that the happiness of Russia, their native land, is in our hands and our intentions.</p><p>We understand what forces of darkness have come crashing down on it and we are trying to help it in any way we can.</p><p>At our Center, teachers, schoolchildren, and their parents are working hard.</p><p>At the present time, we are teaching the children and their parents about Anastasia and her thoughts through presentations and classes, using and distributing your father's books and magazine articles.</p><p>We are also trying to collect scientific literature explaining Anastasia's capabilities.</p><p>We understand the full difficulty of the work to awaken man's consciousness, to overcome the inertia of human thinking, and therefore we are conducting our activities calmly and confidently. We have already made interesting discoveries.</p><p>Some people perceive Anastasia as a lovely fairy tale. Some, after reading the book, join in our work, and some, the fewest, start spreading rumors that Anastasia is another sect. The opinion of the latter makes us smile.</p><p>But as the saying goes, "Lord, forgive them. They know not what they do."</p><p>Most importantly, we are glad that Anastasia has assembled us together in this rural district with its dying agricultural production, in a bankrupt collective farm whose leaders have forgotten the needs of the people and youth, in the very place where M. I. Kalinin was once born and the Verkhnetroitsky millionaire collective farm flourished.</p><p>Here, at the Anastasia Center of the M. I. Kalinin Country School, our program was born, Rainbow, which aims to develop and put into practice creative efforts to improve our native territory, to give the next generation an education in labor and morals, and to create a base for the production of ecologically pure agricultural output.</p><p>The purpose of the Rainbow program is to create a young people's cultural and ecological production association called Rus, which will include Lada, a Slavic cultural center, and Rod, an ecological production complex.</p><p>This is the program Anastasia has helped us create.</p><p>Let the unbelievers believe at least in their unbelief, while we implement our program, no matter how unrealistic it might seem to some.</p><p>Our goal is to allow young people to experience their own creative power in practice.</p><p>One of the aspects of the Rainbow program is local history, the study of our native territory's ancient history, the life and culture of our Slav ancestors.</p><p>At one time, the city of Medved was built next to Verkhnyaya Troitsa. Virtually nothing is known about it. It was wiped from the face of the Earth. Along the banks of the Medveditsa River there are Slav burial mounds. Do some of them have the same significance as the dolmens in Gelendzhik, where the battle between the Medved host and the Ordynetses took place? We need this information; we do not want to be forgetful. We will take under our protection and restore what we can, if only fragments. That is our request to Anastasia, Polina.</p><p>In the spring we will begin creating a nursery to cultivate cedar saplings. It will become a reality thanks to our fellow villager, the forester Georgy Shaposhnikov, who has left us an amazing gift.</p><p>Our children's theater, led by the Siberian Tatiana Yakovlevna Zaonegina, will be staging a performance based on stories from Anastasia. The children are very enthusiastic about this idea.</p><p>We hope very much that other centers and associations that Anastasia has helped create will contact us. May Divine lines of Light stretch all across Russia between the centers.</p><p>Mutual interaction, even if written, will multiply our forces and help us find the answer more quickly.</p><p>Our address:</p><p>Anastasia Ecological Center</p><p>M. I. Kalinin School, Verkhnyaya Troitsa</p><p>Kalinin District, Tver Province, 171622</p><p>The following goes out from our school to everyone for whom Anastasia exists.</p><p>Obey the Order, Brothers Dear!</p><p>To help Anastasia</p><p>Make the Earth's world happy,</p><p>To forestall disaster,</p><p>To forget it forever,</p><p>We awaken amiably at six</p><p>And with a smile and an open heart</p><p>Reach for the stars</p><p>To drive out the boredom in us.</p><p>And reach, as in childhood,</p><p>For our dear mama, as a bride:</p><p>Give it to me! Take this, my dear!</p><p>And a mischievous smile envelops us,</p><p>At that instant—</p><p>Mama's image to her replies.</p><p>Hello, Mother Nature,</p><p>You are with the Father at the Birth</p><p>You gave birth to our heroes—</p><p>None better in the Universe.</p><p>Slav woman! Sister dear!</p><p>We've long been awaiting you.</p><p>Your ray reached us,</p><p>We are carrying out your instructions.</p><p>Obey the order, brothers dear!</p><p>At six in the morning! In the dark! As in the book!</p><p>We will fire artillery,</p><p>Go about our affairs for fifteen minutes.</p><p>We must support our sister dear,</p><p>So our offspring do not get upset,</p><p>We answer for them, after all,</p><p>How can we leave them alone!</p><p>Not for the first time must we get used to</p><p>Breaching the blockade!</p><p>Valery, officer of the Russian navy</p><p>Success to you and all the best, Polina. We at the Center will be happy to receive from you information concerning Anastasia. Please convey our best wishes to your father.</p><p>Happy New Year!"</p><p>"What do you say to this letter, Anastasia?"</p><p>"I say that the human soul's aspirations are beautiful. This has nothing to do with you or me. This is only about the strength of their souls and their beauty. The name should not be mine. Their names would be worthier. I grew up in the cradle of the Creator, whereas their soul has overcome the agonies of hell and was able to endure.</p><p>"For years the string of adversities, deprivations, temptations, and vanities strove to distort their concept of good. Their souls managed to overcome everything. They are stronger than those who have cut themselves off from the world with a stone wall. They in the world will themselves make the world beautiful. Their names should be in the title. If all the centers start using my name, a cult will arise, and that cannot be allowed. A cult of personality or image always leads man away from the main thing, from himself."</p><p>"So what happens then? In Moscow, the Solntsev Center and at the Larionova Center in Gelendzhik there are already Anastasia sections, under the International Academy of Spiritual Development, how will people find out the centers' orientation?"</p><p>"All people have been given intuition, and the essence is not determined by the name. The soul must sense the deed."</p><p>"This is an interesting turn. We will have to give this more thought. You are not the usual, Anastasia. Interacting with you not only makes me have to work at my thoughts, but others, too, will have to think. When are we to relax? The letter also asks you a specific question: What are the burial mounds there by their river, on the Medveditsa?"</p><p>"There is no need to excavate the mounds. The mounds have fulfilled their purpose, and those people were born there who were the first to ask the main question."</p><p>"What question?"</p><p>"Think for yourself, Vladimir. For now, I'll say that you should help those like them to know one another. Put their addresses in the book. Let all the letters, which are akin to light rays, help people warm hearts. Korotynsky, a St. Petersburg poet, wrote you with a hint long ago:</p><p>From heart to heart the ray of Love</p><p>Will flash, a Divine thread.</p><p>Pluck the soul from the dust</p><p>And suffuse it with the heavens' heights.</p><p>"All right, I get it. I myself wanted to publish the letters and poems readers had sent. I wanted to publish them as a separate volume. I myself felt that there was something far from simple in them. Their addresses can be made available through the Moscow center, so that people can help each other. My daughter Polina can also do this work. She feels responsible for the letters.</p><p>"It might turn out to be a good thing when people from different countries interact through the soul. They will find soul mates, marry, or at least make friends, start a new common cause, or produce things together. That's it! That's great! I will publish that collection. Also, you know, we have a matchmaking service. In the newspapers people print ads, looking for mates, so in their ads they have their height, eye color, and age, as if they were selecting a cow for their farm. But here it would probably be better if people met based on their spirit and started to help one another."</p><p>"Of course, a union in spirit is better and more stable."</p><p>"Yes. There's just one problem."</p><p>"A problem? What is it?"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0323>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>23. Recreate Shambala</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>"It so happens, for some reason, that critics of me and my book come mainly out of Novosibirsk . Yes, in general, only there do they criticize me.</p><p>"The book has been published in three foreign countries, and many other countries are offering contracts. In Novosibirsk, they keep railing away. Polina is there, and I can imagine how she suffers. The critics say about the anthology, 'He's come up with another ruse. He should have stayed in business.' Novosibirsk television ran a broadcast about the first entrepreneurs. They mentioned me in it, too, and showed an interview with Polina. They asked my daughter, 'Is your papa no longer in business?' Polina tried to say something about spirituality, but they cut her off."</p><p>"In a little while, most Novosibirskers will look on you and your book with understanding. Of your old friends, the best will return to you, and new friends will appear," Anastasia said.</p><p>"At one of the city centers not far from the Eternal Flame, your new and former friends will build an Avenue of Cedars."</p><p>"That's great! That's just the ticket! Just think of such a thing. An Avenue of Cedars near the Eternal Flame—that would be amazing, Anastasia, my dear dreamer."</p><p>She leapt up from the grass, knelt, beaming all over, clapped her hands, and suddenly whispered, "Thank you for those words. 'Dear.' 'My.' That's me, isn't it, Vladimir. Have I become dear to you?"</p><p>"That's just our way of talking. But your dream truly is beautiful."</p><p>"It will come true, believe me. All of it will be as I dreamed."</p><p>"Nothing in this world happens by itself. Now, if you could create some kind of miracle in Novosibirsk. But no, not just a miracle. What can miracles do? They don't fire anyone's passion. If you could make it so that each of the city's residents became just a little richer and healthier, so that each person in Novosibirsk was happier, then people might plant that avenue. But I don't think all your Forces of Light put together could do that. No one could."</p><p>"You're right, Vladimir. No one has power over the human will. Unhappy or happy—each person makes his own destiny. Each person's consciousness chooses his path."</p><p>"But who is playing with our consciousness? Who is keeping us from choosing the one that will make unhappy people happy?"</p><p>"Why look for causes outside yourself, Vladimir? What do you change if you start blaming someone? A beautiful thought was born in you, to create something good for the people of that city. I like it a lot, and I need to dream on it.</p><p>"Yes! Wonderful! I've come up with something! That's great! All the people of Novosibirsk will go down in history. A happy generation will be born there. Each person living there will be happier right now, too.</p><p>"Let us think together how to tell the people of the city that worries you so much, by breaking through to each person's heart and soul."</p><p>"What do you want to say to each of them?"</p><p>"That together they can recreate Shambala."</p><p>"What is this Shambala? Speak more clearly."</p><p>"For centuries seekers have been looking for a holy place on Earth. They believe it is called Shambala and that in that place a connection can happen between anyone and the universal wisdom.</p><p>"But no one has been able to find Shambala, though seekers have traveled to foreign lands quite a bit. And they will not find it if they keep searching this way, for Shambala is inside each of us, and its outward manifestation is recreated by people."</p><p>"Be more specific. What has to be done for this connection with the wise Universe and to be happier, and not inside? All this inside stuff is hard to understand. Tell me about the outward, what has to be built, sown, or broken?"</p><p>"Let each resident of the big city get a small cedar nut from a resinous cone, put it in his mouth, and hold it in his saliva. Then plant it at his home in earth in a small pot and water the earth every day. Before watering he should lower his fingers into the water, his condition must be good-natured, and let him wish himself, and most of all his descendants, his children, good and the awareness of God. And do that every day.</p><p>"Then a shoot will rise up that he can have silent conversations with about what is most precious. On a summer's day when it doesn't freeze at night, he must put the pot with the shoot outside among other plants. Let it make contact with the stars, Moon, and Sun, know the rain, breeze, and spirit of the grasses growing nearby, and return to his house again to his friends and parents. This can be done many times, whenever there is the time and desire.</p><p>"Over time the shoot will grow up. After all, a cedar lives more than fifteen hundred years, and your descendants will let the new cedars tell about the soul that nurtured them. When it grows to thirty centimeters in the house, the shoot can be planted in the earth in the early spring. Let the city authorities set aside one square meter of land for each person who has no land of his own for the sapling.</p><p>The saplings will be planted on the edge of the city, on the riverbank and along the roads, between the houses and in the middle of teeming squares. Let the people protect their own seedling and help each other.</p><p>For centuries people will come to this city from all over the Earth to see them, to touch its holy objects, and to exchange a word with its happy people."</p><p>"Why should people come from all over the Earth? To look at the ordinary landscaping of a city? Now if you suddenly discovered some holy objects in Novosibirsk! Dolmens, for instance, as in Gelendzhik. You told me about the Gelendzhik dolmens, and now people are streaming in from various cities of Russia as well as other countries. I've seen it. Every day now there are excursions to the dolmens.</p><p>"And every year in September, readers gather from different cities for a conference. Artists set up painting exhibits and films are shot there. And here, big deal, there will be trees growing in the city. Not even trees, just cedar saplings."</p><p>"These won't be just saplings. They will be akin to the ringing cedars. Warmed by the warmth of human hearts, their soul touching man's, they will take in the Universe's best rays and send them out to people. For centuries, both people and the Earth will shine in this place. A new consciousness will come, and these people's discoveries, on a universal scale, will go all over the Earth!</p><p>"A holy place, do you know what that is? Believe me, Vladimir, you wouldn't recognize it in your hometown."</p><p>"This is all appealing, of course. But you must understand, Anastasia. No one is likely to believe just you about this. History has never known anything like it, and modern science will not confirm it. If something weightier than you, with authority, known to everyone, had shown such a thing . . ."</p><p>"The Quran speaks wisely about what the trees mean. The Buddha, too, learned wisdom by going off into the forest for a long time. Tell me, Vladimir, you've read the Bible, haven't you?"</p><p>"Yes. What of it?"</p><p>"The Old Testament says that before the Birth of Christ, the wisest of the Earth's rulers, King Solomon used cedar to build a temple to God's glory and a house for himself. He employed thousands of people to chop down cedars, which were brought to him from far-off places. King Solomon was most wise, as the Bible says, and the Song of Songs, which he wrote, has come down to the present day.</p><p>"The Old Testament also says that toward the end of his life and days his harem of wives from different countries and of different faiths began leading Solomon away from his faith. He came to know various faiths, and do you know which one took hold of him?"</p><p>"Which one?"</p><p>"The one where they plant trees as well as chop them down. As he was dying, the wise king understood that his home and his temple would be obliterated in time, his descendants would not retain power and greatness. The state's might would fade—and all that is what happened.</p><p>"To this day his soul agonizes over the mistake he made. The wise king understood, 'Nothing pleasing to God can be accomplished by killing what is alive, what the Creator has made.' The anguish of his soul and many human souls has gone on for millennia, gazing upon how a single mistake can last for millennia. It can be fixed, and then a beautiful dawn will rise over the world once again. The word will go out about your city over all earthly and universal channels.</p><p>"Of all the miracles in the world that have come down to our day, no one has yet heard of a city where each inhabitant raised such trees with a special love, kindness, and soul, or transformed a petrified city into a dimension of Love, a true, living, universal temple. For this there must be Divine awareness, so let it arise in each person and help them understand their own and the universal purpose."</p><p>"There may be a rational kernel to what you say, Anastasia, and I may write about that. Let people themselves determine it all, but you know, I have to warn you. You are going to lose something here, too. You keep talking about the trees. . . . Well, basically. . . You won't ever be able to marry officially. You don't have the documents you need for the Registry Office, and here you are talking with such import about trees. . . . Vergers already consider you a pagan, and as soon as I write these words of yours, they will not let you close to the temple near you and will never marry you."</p><p>"Vladimir, write my words and let these people learn them. Do not be ashamed of these words and humble your pride. Not everyone may grasp the significance of these words right away. But your city has many scientists, and they will say what I have failed to in scientific language, if you think people will understand them more. And the journalists . . . Don't be angry at them for their criticism. Not all your journalists have had their say yet. And if I do have to get married, believe me, Vladimir, someone will be found to marry me."</p><p>"What if people do the same thing in a different city, not Novosibirsk?"</p><p>"Any city can be reborn this way. In order for these actions to be carried out, a different consciousness has to take root in people, and if it does, they will change the face of the city. But there will be a first among them who will be the first to know Grace."</p><p>"You are blessed, Anastasia, and naïve, always dreaming only of what is best. All right, I will write what you have said. Let people know this, too."</p><p>"Thank you. Thank you. . . . I don't know how else to show my gratitude."</p><p>"Don't worry, it's not hard to write. You can add more, but just a little."</p><p>"I beg of you, people, do not read my words in a rush. Grasp them."</p><p>"Here you are, Anastasia, answering the questions readers ask and talking about man as a creator when you're a woman. Do you know what the leader of one religion said about women?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"He said that women cannot create. Their purpose consists in being beautiful and merely inspiring men to various deeds and creativity, but only men create everything."</p><p>"Vladimir, do you agree with such statements?"</p><p>"I probably could. You know, there are statistics—science is impartial. So if you look at the statistics, this is the situation you find."</p><p>"What situation?"</p><p>"Andrei Rublyov, Surikov, Vasnetsov, Rembrandt, and other famous artists were all men, and there are no women among them at all, at least no women come to mind. The inventers of the airplane, automobile, electric engine, satellites, and missiles were also men. Right now one of the most popular arts is cinema, and a director is needed to make the film, he is one of the most important figures in cinema. And once again, all the best film directors are men. There are some women, but they're rare. And their movies aren't as outstanding and interesting as the men's. The best musicians are always men, and philosophers, both those who have come down to us from antiquity and modern ones—also men."</p><p>"Why are you telling me all this, Vladimir?"</p><p>"It's just that I have this idea. I think it will help you."</p><p>"What idea? Can you share it with me?"</p><p>"This idea. Anastasia, you should be paying more attention to beautification here and to raising our child and not overburden yourself about the world and people. Ultimately, men can sort out all these matters. Only men, that's what the statistics say. Exact, impartial science. In history, too, it's always been that men did the main things, and there's no getting away from history, either. Do you understand how incontrovertible this idea is?"</p><p>"Yes, I understand you, Vladimir."</p><p>"Just don't get upset. It's better to understand it all sooner and go about your own affairs and not those which others can do better. You're trying to change the world for the better, but only men can do that. They have invented all the best things and create everything better than women. Do you agree?"</p><p>"Vladimir, I agree that outwardly man looks like the creator. If you look at it from a material standpoint."</p><p>"What does that mean, 'outwardly'? How else, from what other standpoint can you look at incontrovertible facts? Don't get all philosophical here, just tell me specifically. Can you create anything? For instance, can you at least embroider? Can you embroider a pretty design on fabric with a needle?"</p><p>"I couldn't embroider a design."</p><p>"But why?"</p><p>"I couldn't pick up a needle. A needle is something made from the depths of living nature. Why create something if first you have to destroy a great, living creation? Imagine someone foolish slashing a picture, Vladimir, the canvas of a great artist, a creator, as you put it, and start cutting little rabbits and figures out of the pieces of canvas. Can his action be called creativity after first discounting his foolishness? But if someone else who is intelligent and understands what is around him does the same thing, then his actions take on a different definition."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Let's think about this together. For instance, his actions could be called vandalism."</p><p>"Really now, that's going too far. You mean all creators and artists are vandals?"</p><p>"They are artists and creators in their awareness of the universe at their level. But if they find an awareness at another level, their creations will come about by other means."</p><p>"What other means?"</p><p>"The same means the Creator used to create everything in his burst of inspiration. And he has given the ability to perfect his creations and make new ones to man, to man alone.</p><p>"How did the Creator create everything? And what instrument did he give man for creation?"</p><p>"Thought is the Great Creator's main instrument. And man has been given thought. Creations are true when operating in the thought's undertakings are the soul, intuition, emotions, and most of all, the main thing, an awareness of purity.</p><p>Look, a flower is growing at your feet. Its shape and color are beautiful, they change a half-tone in living creation, now improve it with your thought. Concentrate. Try to change them for a better vision."</p><p>"Like what, for example?"</p><p>"Imagine for yourself, Vladimir."</p><p>"Well, I can imagine. For instance, let this oxeye have a red petal and the other stay the way it is, and if they alternate, I think that would be better, more cheerful."</p><p>Suddenly Anastasia became completely still. She began looking closely at the white oxeye. And you realize, quietly, slowly, but before their eyes, the oxeye changed the color of its petals. They now alternated: red, white, and red again. At first the red ones were barely noticeable, then they got redder and redder, and finally they were ablaze, so they seemed to shine red.</p><p>"There you see, it happened as you thought it, and I created it all with my thought."</p><p>"You mean all people can do that?"</p><p>"Yes! And they do. But they use material which they have first deadened, and what is dead can only decompose. Thus humanity has been struggling for centuries to halt the decomposition of their creations, and thus human thought is given over more and more to decay, and man has no time to think true creation is called for.</p><p>"Thought precedes everything, then with time it is embodied in matter or society is rearranged. But they can't tell right away whether what they have created is better or worse.</p><p>"Here you wanted to change the color of the oxeye's petals. I changed them with my thought, the oxeye obeyed man's thought. Now look closely. Did you think of something better? Something more perfect than what had been?"</p><p>"I think it's more cheerful now and colorful."</p><p>"But why do you speak of your new Creation without enthusiasm?"</p><p>"I don't know. Maybe there's still something missing, some colors. I don't know yet."</p><p>"The colors now contradict each other. The gentlest half-tones have paled because of the color. Loud color cannot evoke calm, gentle feelings."</p><p>"All right, try to put it all back."</p><p>"I can't, the oxeye itself can change back. The red will diminish. We did not kill it, after all. It is alive. Nature itself will restore everything to harmony."</p><p>"So in your opinion, Anastasia, all men are slow-witted vandals and women are creators?"</p><p>
"All men and women are one; the principles are in each and the two merge into one. In creation, too, they are indivisible; earthly being exists for them both."</p><p>"But how can that be? It's not at all clear. Here am I, for instance. I'm just a man."</p><p>"But what are you made of, Vladimir? The flesh of woman and the flesh of man merged into one, they united in you, and the spirit of both merged into one spirit."</p><p>"Then why do they say and write treatises about what a woman is and what a man is and which of them is stronger, which is superior?"</p><p>"Think about who wants, and to what purpose, to replace your awareness, your consciousness, which the Creator gave everyone from the beginning, with their own dogma?"</p><p>"But what if the Creator gave some more than others, and he, the teacher, is trying to share his wisdom with everyone?"</p><p>"Each shoot on Earth, each seed of a birch, cedar, or flower, has plenty of the Creator's information.</p><p>"So how could the idea come to you that the Creator might contemplate falling short for the Supreme Creation? What could be more insulting to the Father than a reproach such as that?"</p><p>"You know I'm not reproaching anyone. I'm just thinking, to myself."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0324>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>24. Who Are You, Anastasia?</h2>************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div> </p><p> </p><p>Before asking Anastasia this question, I looked at her closely. Here sitting before me was a woman, young and beautiful, who outwardly scarcely differed from the people of our civilization. Except perhaps by the lightness one could sense even outwardly that ran through her body, a lightness in her posture and gestures, and especially when she stood up and walked. She did all this with an unusual lightness.</p><p>The cumbersome, heavy gait of an elderly person differs significantly from the movements of someone young, energetic, and full of life. But there was that same difference between the movements and gait of Anastasia and even a young athlete. She seemed light as a feather and at the same time she was physically strong. She easily carried my heavy backpack fifteen kilometers while also helping me walk.</p><p>During our short breaks she did not lie down or take a seat, exhausted, but moved, first running off to collect herbs, then massaging my foot. And all this with a lightness, cheerfulness, and smile. Why was she so full of life?</p><p>Try sometimes to look closely at the stream of people walking down the street, their faces. I have. Nearly all of them are concentrated, depressed, or gloomy. Especially when it's a single person. And he doesn't seem to be carrying a heavy burden, he's dressed decently, and he obviously isn't hungry because he's smoking expensive cigarettes, but on his face is the stamp of tension and grave thoughts, and that's the way it is for many, for most. Whereas she is joyful all the time. Like a carefree child she beams happiness at the sun, and the herbs, and the rain and clouds all the time, and even when you talk about serious matters with her, she is never sad.</p><p>Which is why now . . . No, her appearance was not very characteristic. Anastasia was sitting with her head slightly bowed and eyelashes lowered, as if she were embarrassed or a little sad, as if she could tell what I wanted to ask her about. But I still asked.</p><p>"If you look through all the letters, Anastasia, you will be convinced of the different things you're called, even extraterrestrial. In her book, a well-known psychologist, the researcher Lavrova, called you a biologist of an extraterrestrial civilization. Ordinary readers call you a goddess, although they behave oddly and write as if to a close friend. You are probably the first they have ever called a Goddess, but they aren't worshipping but speaking as if to a close friend.</p><p>"Scientists and religious leaders for the most part call you an essence, a high essence, a self-sufficient substance.</p><p>"Here I am interacting with you, I wrote a book about our meetings, and I cannot figure out who you are. Can you explain to me clearly and distinctly who you are?"</p><p>"Vladimir, who do you see in me?" Anastasia asked without looking up. "And why is it so important to you what others say?"</p><p>"That's the whole point, that I myself don't know what I'm seeing. If I were to tell you honestly . . ."</p><p>"Tell me, Vladimir, honestly and sincerely, and I will try to understand it all."</p><p>"Well, all right, I'll tell you everything. . . . When I saw you the first time, Anastasia, I perceived you as an ordinary woman. When I went into the forest with you the first time, we sat down to rest and you undressed to your shift and took off your kerchief and I saw you were beautiful, attractive. You understand, among us women like that are called sexy or said to have sex appeal. That time with you . . . well, you know yourself what I wanted. Do you remember?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"So now, maybe because of all these incomprehensible things, I don't want that anymore, even when I see you naked."</p><p>"You're afraid of me now, Vladimir, right?"</p><p>"Not afraid, I don't think so. But so much is incomprehensible. Here our son was born, but you seem to grow more distant, and even when you're nearby, like now, sitting, you still seem far away, not close. I get that feeling. The thought never leaves me that you're some kind of essence."</p><p>"I may be, but so are you."</p><p>"No. I'm not an essence. No one has called me that in the letters. Readers sometimes get angry at me in their letters, but no one has any doubt that I'm a human being."</p><p>"I beg of you, Vladimir, understand, I am a woman, and I am also a human being."</p><p>"You say you're also a human being, but you don't want to do the most elementary things. You don't want to live like all people live. The whole world. Everyone wants an apartment, furniture, a car—you don't.</p><p>"The books are starting to make money, and soon there will be more. Let me buy an apartment, furniture, a car, and we'll travel to holy sites and take our son along. Our civilization right now is restoring temples and monasteries, and in other countries there are many holy sites and historical monuments. But you don't have anything here, no holy sites, so what keeps you here? What do you have to lose?"</p><p>"Vladimir, my dimension is here, the Creator's creation in its primordial form. My foremother and my mother, my fathers caressed each blade of grass with their love, each magnificent cedar remembers the warmth of their hands and gazes. And in the spring the seeds of all the plants put out shoots. And each little grain that touches the ground in the spring contains all the information of the Universe. Including information about the Light of Grace they will see.</p><p>"The little grain will grow into a shoot, the nice Sun will help it along, and the shoot will stretch toward man and for something even more than the Sun has, for the Light of Grace.</p><p>"This is how the Creator created everything. He thought of this so that man could continue to create with it. My parents preserved the Creator's creations, the dimension of Love is here! My parents gave it to me.</p><p>"Can there be anything holier in the world than the Creator's creations, one's parents, the vibrant Love that has filled the dimension?</p><p>"This is what each person, each parent, must do. Give the child he bears a dimension of Love! A dimension as beautiful as the mother's womb, and only there can their future child, their future, be happy.</p><p>"I am giving our son a holy site and a dimension of Love."</p><p>"You are giving him that, but where is my dimension of Love? What can I give our son?"</p><p>"Many have had their chain of succession disturbed. But the thread has not been broken. There is a thread connecting the Creator to everyone at once and each person individually, and each person just has to understand and feel it, and then each person can acquire both light and strength. Vladimir, you should expand the dimension of Love. In the world where you now live, create a dimension of Love. For our son, for all the children of Earth, turn the entire Earth into a dimension of Love."</p><p>"I don't understand. What do you want from me? To change the whole Earth?"</p><p>"Yes! That is what I want!"</p><p>"And for everyone to love one other, for there to be no more wars or crime, and for the air to be clean? The water?"</p><p>"May it be so on the whole Earth."</p><p>"And only then will I be considered a real father who has given our son something?"</p><p>"Only then will you be a father respected by your son."</p><p>"You mean otherwise he won't respect me?"</p><p>"For what, Vladimir? For which actions of yours do you want to gain your son's respect?"</p><p>"For the same thing all children in the world respect their fathers. Fathers give them life."</p><p>"What kind of life? When a child comes into the world, where does he find his joys? And why is there so much unhappiness in the world given by fathers? The newly born must live in this unhappiness, and here the person giving birth feels irrelevant. This is how we live, and we want respect and are amazed when we don't get it.</p><p>"Believe me, Vladimir, children truly respect very few of their fathers. This is why when they grow up a little they abandon their parents, forget them, and in this way, albeit intuitively, they both blame their parents and repeat their mistake themselves. Vladimir, if you want to earn your son's respect, you are going to have to create a happy world."</p><p>"Oh, yes. . . . Now I see. . . ." I leapt up. There was despair and fury in my mind. My thoughts swarmed.</p><p>Now I understood, and I hope it has become clear to everyone. Anastasia is a fanatic hermit. This is what I supposed right away, at our first meeting. She may have unusual abilities of unknown origin, and these abilities of hers, her ray, are not commensurate, by which I mean, her abilities are not commensurate with her. You remember, she said, "I will carry people across the dark forces' span of time." Yes, obviously, she herself realized this was beyond her strength to do, and now she was trying to draw me and her readers into this fruitless dream. I see that along with this fanaticism and abnormality there is in her an incredible cunning, and with its help she does everything for the sake of her dream!</p><p>She bore a child and got me to write a book now. What a thing to say: "In order to earn your son's respect, remake the world, turn the entire world into a dimension of Love, and give it to your son and all the children. . . ." Methodically and subtly she is drawing everyone into her dream and keeps complicating the task before me. First, write a book, now create a dimension of Love throughout the world. Then what? We know quite a few fanatics who have tried to change the world, and where are they now? They've dispersed like smoke. And here is another in front of me with a lowered head, and still . . . Change the world.</p><p>I knew it was pointless to argue with people who were abnormal, fanatics. You have to calm down and walk away, but I couldn't help myself. I told her everything as she sat with her gaze lowered as before.</p><p>"I understand. I understand who you are. You're a combination of essence and human being. And you're cunning. Exceptionally cunning. How subtly you've woven your intrigue! Make me write a book and bear a son as bait.</p><p>"You tried with your inhuman logic to conceal your fanaticism, only you made a blunder. It's a blunder, you see. While I was writing the book I came into contact with lots of people and understood a lot. I was given many different spiritual books to read. I don't know what you know about them, but I can say one thing.</p><p>"A thousand years ago and more, wise men, great and holy, appeared on earth, and their different spiritual trends live on to this day. There are more than two thousand different religions on Earth, I heard them say in a television broadcast about this. All of them talk about good, and teach everyone how to live, and each leader tells us that the Truth is in him alone. There are plenty of holy sites around, and what good has come of their millennia of talking shop? From their teachings?</p><p>"I've understood just one thing. The millennia pass, but the war does not end. The war among the teachings. Whoever wins is considered right, but not for long. Time passes, there's a new war, and a new teaching wins. But no one pays any attention to those who fell in that war. If I were to say it all outright . . . You know who you are and what you're calling on me and all your readers to do?"</p><p>Anastasia stood up, looked me calmly in the eyes, and said, "Please don't go on, Vladimir. Believe me, I know what you might say. Let me. It will be briefer and without name-calling."</p><p>"You? All right, give it a try. And without name-calling. What did I want to say?"</p><p>"You wanted to say, Vladimir, you were talking about the many prophets there have been on Earth, the teachers. There are many different teachings, and it is hard for you to sort them out. But I will tell you, and you can understand it all if you want to.</p><p>"The criterion that will serve to assess everything is WATER. With each passing day, the water gets dirtier. And the air is hard to breathe.</p><p>"The succession of secular rulers, no matter what temples they've erected, will be remembered by their descendants only for the dirt that came down from them. Life gets more and more dangerous with each passing day, but we're alive. You thought I was one of those who tries to teach everyone how to live, Vladimir. One of those who creates another religion, trying to place herself at its head.</p><p>"I assure you, though, I would not allow in myself the kind of egoism that incinerated all those enlightened people later. I can and will win! I will stop the fume and stench of factory smoke, and the miners will realize that they should not rip open the Earth's veins.</p><p>"I beg of you, people, change your professions quickly, all those professions that bring harm to the Earth, to the Creator's great creation.</p><p>"I beg of you, people, to understand quickly that no one can be happy on Earth who continues to damage the Earth.</p><p>"A little time will pass, and human misfortune all over the Earth will go into its death throes and the Earth will burn up in its own fire.</p><p>"Human consciousness will carry people across the dark forces' span of time. Vladimir, look around you. What I have dreamed has already come true. My dream has been picked up by the Universe and is being given out to all people. All humanity is already racing over the abyss, only the doubter will fall into the abyss. But humanity, believe me, Vladimir, humanity will be saved.</p><p>"People will see who children are, and people will come to know life in paradise.</p><p>"Events in Russia are not happening randomly. Vladimir, take a closer look at events. I am undoing the hell foretold for Earth."</p><p>"But who are you, who do you consider yourself to be?"</p><p>"Oh, do you still not understand? The postulates have placed disbelief in your own soul in you. I am a sorceress and my dreams and aspirations are fruitless, is that what you think? But doubts are torturing you. You do and don't believe yourself, and that is my fault. I'm such a bungler. Everything I say is confused and incomprehensible. People, everyone who is reading this, forgive me. I cannot find the words to make it understandable to absolutely everyone. Forgive me, Vladimir, for misleading you. They do not understand everything you've written and they are laughing at you.</p><p>"But how can I atone for my guilt? It occurred to me that if you like I could play the complete fanatic. Or I could appear as myself, understand it that way if you like, but sincerely believe that I sincerely want good for all people, just know that.</p><p>"Please, do not frown. Smile. Look at how beautiful everything around you is. Do not torture yourself. I don't want there to be any mystery. If it is easier for you to take me for a naïve sorceress, then take me for whatever you believe."</p><p>"There, that's a little better. There's clarity. So, you mean, you've been acting the whole time?"</p><p>"Are you perceiving my acting with your Soul?"</p><p>"Acting should be cheerful."</p><p>"Naturally, you're right about that. There should be lightness and simplicity in everything, and I should be cheerful."</p><p>Through the clouds, the nice sun's rays were shining on the lake's smooth surface and its shore. Drops of rain were lying on the bushes' leaves and the grass, and circles were rippling on the water from the drops of rain. Anastasia, who before this had been speaking with agitation and quietly, not taking her eyes off me, suddenly looked from side to side, clapped her hands, and laughed.</p><p>A ringing, infectious, inviting laugh spilled out over the cedars' branches and the lake's shore and surface. In childish delight she began spinning in the rare drops of rain and laughing like a child. But every few minutes she would break off her fiery dance.</p><p>I saw the sun's rays playing on her face, which was aglow either in raindrops or in tears. Suddenly everything around us fell still, and Anastasia's ringing, confidently desperate phrases filled the space and were borne upward. The air above the taiga became bluer and the birds fell silent. As if the birds were listening to everything as Anastasia's phrases flew off into space.</p><p>"Hey you, prophets! Talking for millennia about the despair and frailty of earthly existence, frightening people with hell and judgment. Cool your ardor. It is your fault man has so much trouble understanding Heaven.</p><p>"Hey, Nostradamus! Nostradamus, you didn't predict, you created with your thought the dates of terrible cataclysms for Earth. You made many people believe you and thereby led their thoughts to make something terrible come true. Your thought hovers over the planet, frightening people with its prophesy and despair, but now it will not come to pass. Let your thought do battle with mine. Of course, you know everything in advance and that is why you flee so quickly.</p><p>"Hey, you who call yourselves teachers of men's souls! Teachers who try to tell man that he is weak of spirit, knows nothing, and all Truths are accessible to you alone as the chosen one. Only through worship of you is the Divine voice and the Truth of universal creation accessible. Cool your ardor, now let everyone know that the Creator gives each person everything from the beginning, and one has only not to cover the great creations with a host of postulates, a host of fictions to please the pride of their Creator. Do not stand between God and men. The Father wants to speak with each person himself. The Father does not know intermediaries.</p><p>"Each person has the Truth in his soul from the beginning. Let each person be happy right now, today, not tomorrow! The Creator filled each moment and every age with happiness. There is no room in His intentions for his beloved offspring to suffer."</p><p>She was acting! With such inspiration! So desperately! Of course she was acting, but why was that unusual light shining above her in the sky over the taiga? It was as if the heavens could record all the phrases the taiga hermit was throwing from the Earth with such inspiration and despair.</p><p>"Hey, predictors of the ages, who predicted darkness for man, thereby creating both darkness and hell. Oh, how assiduously you fed your egregore, frightening man in the name of the Father. Come on, here I am. Everyone here. With my Ray I will burn up the host of age-old postulates in an instant. All the anger on Earth, leave what you are doing, rush to me, fight me, just try.</p><p>"But you, warriors of all faiths, it is you, after all, who created all the wars. Now do not even dream of wars. Do not draw people into war for your mercantile interests with the deceit of obscurantism. I am alone before you. Vanquish me. Come at me, all of you, to vanquish me. The battle will be without a battle, and followers of all faiths will help.</p><p>"My foremothers and my fathers put the True Light of the primary sources in them. Use everything you have safeguarded so carefully for me. Give it to everyone who can accept the Light.</p><p>"Let evil fight itself and my flesh, not my soul. I will give all my soul to people. I will remain in people with my soul. Ready yourself, malevolence, leave the Earth, attack me!</p><p>"I am a human being! I am a hu-man be-ing of the pri-mar-y sour-ces. I am Anastasia. And I am stronger than you."</p><p>"Stop. Why call down all the devils yourself?" I broke in, thinking this was still some game.</p><p>"Vladimir, don't be afraid of them. They are cowardly. Not only that, you yourself said I was cunning. Cunning? So be it. I outwitted them. They laughed at you, thought me a fiction, meanwhile I was creating and bestowing the power that my foremothers and my fathers had brought me from the primary sources upon many people!" She stamped her foot and laughed ringingly and began spinning again like a ballerina. Carried away by her game, I began showing her moral support.</p><p>"Then do it, Anastasia, burn! Let all the Earth's evil rush at you and you incinerate it! Just be careful doing it and don't perish."</p><p>"For me to perish, Vladimir, they would have to leave many earthly affairs. Freeing many human souls from their shackles.</p><p>"But if I do perish, what I dreamed of will come true anyway. The strings of the universal harp will play a happy melody and human souls will hear them. They will understand!</p><p>"Make your sound, Universe! Your happy melody! For them, for all the people of the Earth. Let everyone know the Soul's melody!</p><p>"Human Souls will aim their rays at the Earth, which is weary from its misfortunes. Watch, Vladimir."</p><p>With these words Anastasia ran toward the plastic bag with the readers' letters, dropped to her knees, and placed her hands on the packet.</p><p>Rejoicing ecstatically, like a child, she said, "When an elderly man, a soldier who had been in battle, reading your book, suddenly felt tears well up. When a young mama felt a different attitude toward the child she had borne. And a girl, she's still twelve, understood everything and started to love life. Look, when this young man says he is not going to take drugs anymore and went to see his mother.</p><p>"When people send letters from the prisons, you see, you feel, their souls singing, acquiring a different strength. . . .</p><p>"Their souls understand those signs I found, and the combinations of universal sounds, and now they are heard in them, they accept them. . . . Not yet everyone, but there will be many of them! The heavens know about this and await each person with love.</p><p>"Look, look at how people set forth their understanding in verse."</p><p>She rejoiced so sincerely and kept talking about the letters that I got carried away by the scene and thought, "All right, let her rejoice, let her play her game and believe in her dream's realization. I will write everyone that she is acting. She herself is making up everything and is made joyful from her fictions." I wanted to settle down, and suddenly everything once again got mixed up in my consciousness. I thought it was all a fiction, her imagination, but now, imagine, there was something to make you lose your mind. Imagine, she was talking about the letters and everything that was in fact written in them. Even in letters I hadn't brought to the taiga. But how? She hadn't read them, after all.</p><p>Dumbfounded, I looked and listened to her recite the poems that were in the envelopes, rejoice at something suddenly or fall silent with concern, as if she had read all the letters in a single instant.</p><p>Everything she said about the letters was absolutely precise. Absolutely precise. Precise! Stop! Does that mean that before this she was setting everything out precisely and not acting? Dreaming? Of course she was dreaming! But she had dreamed before about both the book and poems before her now. And her dreams had come true! They had!</p><p>Here is the book lying before her. It is material.</p><p>It's fantastic!</p><p>No, this is unreal!</p><p>Reader, could it be that you are now holding a particle of the desperate hermit's dream materialized into a book?</p><p>And what now?</p><p>Might all the rest really come true as well?</p><p>When I came out of my stupor, I asked her, "Anastasia, how did you find out what people had written in their letters? It's as if you had read them all. Even those I didn't bring."</p><p>Anastasia turned around, all joyously beaming.</p><p>"How simple it all is. Look how you can hear the soul speak."</p><p>Suddenly Anastasia fell silent. In the silence she walked up to me calmly and thoughtfully and said, "Answering all the questions isn't hard, but an answer doesn't fix the problem. An answer gives rise to another question. So today humanity is eating Adam's apple, not knowing they can never be full. Meanwhile, anyone can hear the answer inside himself."</p><p>"But how can each person himself learn which answer is correct and which is incorrect?"</p><p>"It is only egoism that always leads people away from the Truth. Vladimir, try to hear me."</p><p>We sat down on the grass next to the packet of letters. I saw her eyes shine, and her cheeks flushed when she said, "I will tell you about creating, Vladimir, and then each person himself will be able to give answers to their own questions. Please, Vladimir, listen and write about the Creator's great creation. Listen and try to accept with your soul. . . ."</p><p>So began Anastasia's inspired story about creation. But it is long. There isn't room for it here. I will say just one thing: after it I felt like praying.</p><p>Respectfully yours, readers, and until we meet in the next book.</p><p>Vladimir Megre</p><p class=tbc>To be continued....</p>

<p><div class=chapter id=0401>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>1. All This Exists Even Now!</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>"I will tell you about creating, Vladimir, and then each person will be able to answer his own questions himself. Please, Vladimir, listen and write about the Creator's great creation. Listen and try to let your soul understand the aspirations of the Divine dream."</p><p>Anastasia uttered these sentences and fell silent, distraught. She looked at me and said nothing. She was probably upset because she sensed or saw on my face my distrust of what she might say about Creation and God.</p><p>Why shouldn't doubt arise in me or other people, actually? The ardent recluse can dream up all sorts of things. She has no historical proof. If anyone can speak persuasively about the past, it is historians or archeologists. The Bible and the books of other confessions speak of God—many different books. For some reason, though, they speak of God in different ways. Isn't that because no one has conclusive proof?</p><p>"There is proof, Vladimir," Anastasia suddenly uttered confidently and agitatedly in response to my mute question.</p><p>"Where is it?"</p><p>"All the proof, all the Universal truths, are preserved in each human Soul in perpetuity. Inaccuracies and lies cannot live long. The soul rejects them. This is why they have thrown so many different treatises at man. Lies require newer and newer guises. This is why humanity so frequently changes its social order. It is trying to find in it the lost truth. Meanwhile, it has been moving further and further away from it."</p><p>"But who has proven, and how, that each person holds the truth inside—in his soul or somewhere else in man? And if it is there, then why is it hidden?"</p><p>"On the contrary, it strives to appear before each gaze every day. Eternal life is all around us, life's eternity is created by the truth.</p><p>Anastasia quickly pressed her hands to the ground, ran her palms across the grass, and held them out to me.</p><p>"Look, Vladimir, maybe they will drive out your doubts."</p><p>I looked. And lying on her outstretched palms I saw grass seeds, a small cedar nut, and some bug crawling.</p><p>I asked, "What does all this mean? The nut, for instance?"</p><p>"Look, Vladimir, the seed is so tiny, but if you plant it in the ground, a magnificent cedar grows up—not an oak, not a maple, not a rose, only a cedar. The cedar gives birth to another seed like it, and it will have in it, like the very first one, all the information of the primary sources. And if millions of years ago or in the future this kind of seed were to touch the earth, then only a cedar would sprout from the earth. The Creator has placed in it, in each seed of God's perfect creations, all the information in full. Millions of years pass, but they cannot erase the Creator's information. And man—the supreme creation—was given everything by the Creator at the moment of his creation. The Father, inspired by the great dream, has placed all truths and all future achievements in his favorite offspring.</p><p>"So how are we to get hold of this truth in the end? From somewhere there inside us? Our kidneys, heart, or brain?"</p><p>"Our feelings. Try to determine the truth with your feelings. Trust them. Free yourself from mercantile postulates."</p><p>"All right, then, if you know something, speak up. Maybe someone will be able to understand you through their feelings. Well, what is God? Could scientists portray him using some scientific formula?"</p><p>"Scientific formula? It would stretch around the world more than once. When it ended, a new would be born. God is no less than what can be born in thought. He is firmament and vacuum and what cannot be seen. There is no point trying to understand Him with your intellect. You can squeeze all the formulas of Earth, all the information of the universe in the small seed of your soul and turn them into feelings, or let them be revealed to your feelings."</p><p>"But what should I feel? Speak more simply, specifically, clearly."</p><p>"Oh my God! Help me! Help me create a worthy image just out of present-day phrases."</p><p>"There, you see? Now there aren't enough words. You should first read a proper dictionary. It has all the words spoken in life."</p><p>"All of today's. But a modern book does not have the words your forefathers spoke about God."</p><p>"You mean Old Church Slavonic words?"</p><p>"Even earlier. Before Old Church Slavonic writing, there was a way for people to pass on their thoughts to their descendants."</p><p>"What are you talking about, Anastasia? Everyone knows that normal script came from two Orthodox monks. Their names . . . I've forgotten their names."</p><p>"Cyril and Methodius. Is that perhaps what you meant?"</p><p>"Well, yes. They created script, after all."</p><p>"It would be more accurate to say they changed the script of our fathers and mothers."</p><p>"How did they change it?"</p><p>"By decree. So the Slavs' culture would be forgotten forever. The remains of the knowledge of the primary sources left human memory, and a new culture was born, so that the nations would obey other priests."</p><p>"What does a script and a new culture have to do with this?"</p><p>"When children today are taught to write and speak in a foreign language but are forbidden to speak in their current one. Tell me, Vladimir, what would your grandchildren learn about the present day? It is easy to suggest new sciences to those deprived of knowledge about the past by treating those sciences as significant. You can say anything you like to them about their parents. The language is gone, and with it the culture. Such was the calculation. But those who set themselves this goal did not know that the truth's shoot remains forever in the human soul, invisible. It needs only a drop of dew, and it will grow and gain strength. Look, Vladimir. Please, take my words and feel what is behind them."</p><p>Anastasia spoke, first slowly pronouncing her words, then quickly rapping out entire sentences, then suddenly falling silent for a moment, stopping for a moment's thought, and plucked sentences, strange for our speech, as if out of thin air. Sometimes, suddenly, she would weave words I did not know into her speech. But each time she used words unclear in meaning, as if catching herself, she changed them for the correct or more comprehensible words. She was trying to prove something, saying of God:</p><p>"Everyone knows that man is the likeness and image of God. But in what way? Where are God's characteristic features in you? Have you ever given that any thought?"</p><p>"Well, no. I never had occasion to. Why don't you tell me about them."</p><p>"When the weary person goes to bed after the cares of the day, when he stops feeling his relaxed body, his second 'I'—the set of invisible energies—partially leaves his body. In that instant, earthly boundaries do not exist for them. For them, there is neither time nor distance. Your consciousness, in less than an instant, overcomes any limit of the Universe. The set of feelings senses and analyzes past or future events, fits them to the present day, and dreams. All this speaks to the fact that he, man, does not sense the vast universe just with his flesh. His God-given thought creates. Only human thought is capable of creating other worlds or of changing what has been created.</p><p>"Sometimes man cries out in his sleep, frightened by something. The set of his feelings, freed from earthly cares and what was done in the past or future, frightens him.</p><p>"Sometimes man creates in his sleep. His creations strive slowly or quickly to be embodied in earthly existence. Whether it is embodied in an ugly form or radiates harmony depends at least partly on the extent to which inspiration has entered its creation, how precisely and specifically all its aspects are accounted for at the moment of creation, and the extent to which inspiration strengthens his Divine 'I.'</p><p>"In the entire Universe, creation is intrinsic only to God alone and to the son of God.</p><p>"God's thought serves as the origin of everything. His dream is turned into living matter. Human thought, man's dream, first precedes human actions.</p><p>"All people on Earth have equal opportunities to create. However, people use their opportunities differently. Man has been presented with complete freedom in this as well. There is freedom!</p><p>"Now tell me, Vladimir, what kinds of dreams God's children are dreaming today? You, for example, your friends and acquaintances. What do they use their creative dreaming for? What do you use it for?"</p><p>"Me? Well . . . what do you mean what for? Like everyone, I strove to make as much money as I could so as to have a firm footing in life. I acquired a car, more than one, actually. Lots of other things necessary for life, too—decent furniture, for example."</p><p>"And that is all? That is all you used your creative, God-intrinsic dream for?"</p><p>"That's what everyone uses it for."</p><p>"For what?"</p><p>"For money! How can we do without it? To wear decent clothing, for instance, to eat a little better, to buy things, to have a drink. All this is clear. And you're saying, what for?"</p><p>"To eat . . . to drink. Vladimir, you must understand, all this was given to everyone from the beginning, in abundance."</p><p>"It was? Where did it go then?"</p><p>"Where do you think?"</p><p>"I just think the original clothing became tattered, it wore out, and the people ate up all the first food long ago. Times are different now, there is another fashion for clothing, and our tastes in food have changed."</p><p>"Vladimir, God gave his son incorruptible clothing and supplies of food that could never run out."</p><p>"And where is this everything now?"</p><p>"All this has been preserved. Even now, it exists."</p><p>"Tell me where. How can I see the caches where so many reserves have been preserved to this day?"</p><p>"You're about to. Only look with your feelings. Only with your feelings can you know the essence of the Divine dream's creation."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0402>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>2. The Beginning of Creation</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Picture the beginning. No Earth. Matter not yet reflecting the universal light. However, as now, the Universe was filled with a great number of different energies. In the darkness the living essences of the energies thought, and in the darkness they created. They did not need an external source of light. They shone from within and for themselves. Each had everything—thought, feelings, the energy of aspiration. Still, there were differences among them. In each, one energy predominated over all the others. As now, the Universe contained the essence of destruction and the essence that creates life. Others had many shades of different feelings similar to human feelings. Those universal essences simply could not communicate with each other. Inside each essence the many energies were creating first languid, then suddenly lightning-quick movement. What was created within immediately destroyed itself. Their pulsation did not alter the cosmos, it could not be seen by anyone, and each believed that it was all alone in space. Alone!</p><p>The lack of clarity as to their predestination would not let them make imperishable a creation that could bring satisfaction. This is why the pulsation remained in this timeless, limitless space, but there was no general, universal movement.</p><p>All of a sudden, communication touched everyone—everyone in an impulse. Everyone was touched simultaneously by the vast Universe. Among the sets of energies of those living, one suddenly shed light on the others. That set was either very old or very young, although one cannot say in ordinary words. It arose out of the vacuum or out of the sparks of everything one can think of—it doesn't matter. That set strongly resembled man, the man who lives today. It resembled his second "I"—the eternal, holy self, not the material self. The energies of his aspirations and living dreams began for the first time to lightly touch everything real in the Universe, and he alone was so ardent that he set all feeling in motion. The sounds of communication were heard in the Universe for the first time. And if the first sounds were translated into modern words, then we would sense the meaning of the questions and answers.</p><p>From all sides of the vast Universe, one question, uttered by all, sped to Him alone: "What do you desire so ardently?" everyone asked.</p><p>In reply, he, confident in his dream, said, "Joint creation and joy for all from its contemplation."</p><p>"What can joy bring for all?"</p><p>"Birth!"</p><p>"What do you mean birth? Each has had self-sufficiency for a long time."</p><p>"Birth in which parts of everything are included."</p><p>"How can everything being destroyed and created be united into one?"</p><p>"Opposing energies, having first balanced them in yourself."</p><p>"Who is capable of such a thing?"</p><p>"I am."</p><p>"But there is the energy of doubt. Doubt calls on you and destroys the many different energies and tears you to shreds. No one can hold opposites in a single whole."</p><p>"There is also the energy of confidence. Confidence and doubt, when they are equal, help precision and beauty for the future creation."</p><p>"What can you call yourself?"</p><p>"I am God. I can take in particles of all your energies. I will persist! I will create! Creation will bring joy for the entire Universe!"</p><p>The multitudes and the whole Universe released all the essences of their energies into Him alone simultaneously. Each aspired to predominate over all so that it would be embodied supreme.</p><p>So began the great battle of all the universal energies. No magnitude of time, no measure can characterize the scale of this battle. Calm ensued only when everyone had been illuminated by the awareness that nothing can be higher and stronger than the single universal energy, the energy of the Divine dream.</p><p>God possessed the energy of the dream. He was able to perceive everything inside Him, balance everything, and pacify it, and He began to create. Still creating in Himself, still creating future creations in Himself, He cultivated each detail with indefinable speed. He thought through the interconnection to everything for each creation. He did everything alone. Alone in the vast, Universal darkness. Alone in Himself, he accelerated the movement of all the universal energies. Not knowing the outcome frightened everyone and distanced them from the Creator. The Creator ended up in a vacuum, and that vacuum was expanding.</p><p>There was the cold of dying. There was fright and alienation around him, but He, alone, already saw the beautiful dawns, heard the singing of birds, and smelled the blooming fragrance. Alone, he used his ardent dream to produce beautiful creations.</p><p>"Stop," they told Him, "You are in a vacuum. You are going to explode! How can You hold the energies inside You? You have nothing to help You keep a grasp on them, and You will explode. But if You have a moment, stop! Quietly release your creative energies."</p><p>And He replied, "My dreams! I will not betray them. For them I will continue to grasp and accelerate my energies. In my dreams, through the grass and among the flowers, I see the bustle of ants and the hen-eagle boldly soaring, teaching her chicks to fly.</p><p>With His unknowable energy, God sped up within Himself the movement of the entire Universe's energy. In His Soul, inspiration was squeezed into a grain.</p><p>And suddenly He felt a touch. From all sides, everywhere, the touch singed Him with an unknown energy and immediately withdrew, warming with its warmth at a distance, filling Him with some new force. Everything that had been a vacuum suddenly began to shine, and the Universe heard new sounds when God asked with tender ecstasy, "Who are you? What kind of energy?"</p><p>In response he heard words of music: "I am the energy of Love and Inspiration."</p><p>"Your particle is in Me. It alone proved capable of holding back the energy of contempt, hatred, and malice."</p><p>"You are God, Your energy—the dream of Your Soul—was able to bring everything into harmony. If my particle helped this along, then listen to me, oh God, and you will be able to help me."</p><p>"What do you want? Why have you touched me with the full force of your fire?"</p><p>"I realized that I am Love. I cannot use only a particle. I want to give my entire self to Your Soul. I know you will not let all of me in, in order not to destroy the harmony of good and evil. But I will fill the vacuum around You. I will warm everything inside and around You. The Universal cold and gloom will not touch you."</p><p>"What is happening? What? You are shining even more powerfully."</p><p>"Not I myself. This is Your energy, Your Soul. I merely reflect it, and the reflection returns to Your Next."</p><p>Desperate and desirous, God cried out, inspired by Love:</p><p>"Everything is speeding up. Everything inside me is stirring. How beautiful inspiration is! Let the dreams of My creation come to pass in Love."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0403>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>3. Your Appearance for the First Time</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>The Earth! The visible planet, arose, the core of all the Universe and the center of everything. The Earth! Suddenly you could see around it the stars, the Sun and Moon. The invisible, creative light coming from the Earth, found its reflection in them.</p><p>For the first time in the Universe, a new plane of existence appeared—a material plane—and it glowed.</p><p>No one and nothing from the instant the Earth appeared possessed visible matter, the Earth was in contact with everything in the Universe but was also in and of itself.</p><p>It was a self-sufficient creation. What grows and lives, what swam and flew, did not die, disappeared nowhere. Even out of the decay came the mosquito, and a different life fed on the mosquito, and everything merged into a single beautiful life.</p><p>All the universal essences began to look at the Earth in perplexity and admiration. The Earth was in contact with everything, but no one was given to touch it.</p><p>Inspiration mounted inside God. In the light, the vacuum-filled Love, the Divine essence altered its outlines, and the Divine essence took on the shapes the human body now has.</p><p>Divine thought worked outside of speed and time. Inspired and illuminated, it drove all the energies of its thought into eternity and created! There was one more invisible creation still inside it.</p><p>Suddenly the illumination flared up and the energy of Love shuddered, as if singed, with new heat.</p><p>God exclaimed in joyous admiration, "Look, Universe, look! Here is My son! Man! He is standing on Earth. He is material. In him are particles of all the universal energies. He lives on all levels of being. He is my likeness and image, and in him are particles of all your energies, so love him. Love him!</p><p>"My son will bring joy to all there is. He is creation. He is birth. He is everything of everyone. He will create a new creation, and his continuous rebirth will stretch out infinitely.</p><p>"When he is one, and when he is multiplied many times over, he, emanating an invisible light, merging into his single whole, will govern the Universe. He will give the joy of life to everything. I have given him everything, and in the future I will also give him what I have conceived."</p><p>"Thus for the first time you alone were standing on the beautiful Earth." Anastasia concluded her story.</p><p>"Who are you talking about? Me?"</p><p>"You, Vladimir, and also whoever comes into contact with this written line."</p><p>"Anastasia, how can that be? Here you have a total incongruity. How can all those reading stand there where it is said that only one stood? The Bible talks about this, too. First there was one, and his name was Adam. Even you said that God created one."</p><p>"That's all correct, Vladimir. But look, we all came out of the one. His particle, the information placed in him and all others born on Earth, was implanted. And if by will of thought you cast off the weight of your vain cares, you will feel the sensations of those preserved to this day in the small particle. It was there, and it remembers everything. It is in you now and in every living person on Earth. Let it reveal itself, sense what you saw, and you who are now reading this line, what you saw at the beginning of your journey."</p><p>"That's great! So it turns out that everything living right now, on this Earth, was at the very beginning?"</p><p>"Yes. But on this Earth, not that one. The Earth just had a different look."</p><p>"What can you call all of us simultaneously?</p><p>"You're more used to hearing the name 'Adam,' right? I will use that, but you must imagine that it is you. Moreover, each person should imagine himself by this name. I will help the presentation a little with words."</p><p>"Please. I still have a fairly poor picture of myself in those times."</p><p>"To make it easier, imagine yourself entering a garden as spring turns to summer, and in that garden you find the fruits of autumn. In it are beings you are seeing for the first time. It is hard to take it all in at a glance when everything is new and in each is perfection. But remember the first time you saw a flower, Adam, your attention rested on the flower. On the very little flower.</p><p>"Cornflower blue, the petal shapes smooth, consisting of lines. The flower's petals glowed slightly, they seemed to reflect the sky's light. And you, Adam, you sat down by the flower, admiring the creation. But however much you looked at the flower, the vision of the flower changed. A breeze rocked the flower on its thin stem, caressing it, and the petals rustled under the sun's rays, changing the light's angle of reflection, changing its very tender petals half a tone. The petals would tremble in the breeze, then, as in greeting, wave at man, then seem to conduct the music playing in your soul. The subtlest fragrance rushed from the flower to embrace you, man.</p><p>"Suddenly, Adam heard a mighty roar, and he rose up and turned to face the sound. In the distance stood an enormous lion and lioness. The lion's shout proclaimed its presence to the surroundings.</p><p>"Adam began to look at the handsome and mighty figure crowned with a thick mane. When the lion saw Adam, the beast raced at him in mighty leaps, nor did the lioness lag behind. Adam admired the play of their mighty muscles. The beasts came to a stop three meters away from Adam. Man's gaze caressed them. Bliss emanated from man. The caressed lion dropped to the ground in bliss, and the lioness lay down beside him. She did not stir, so as not to disturb the warm. grace-filled light coming to them from man.</p><p>"Adam combed the lion's mane with his fingers, examined and touched the claws of his powerful paw, touched his white fangs with his hand, and smiled when the lion purred blissfully."</p><p>"Anastasia, what was that light that came from man in the beginning so that the lion didn't tear him to pieces? Why doesn't light come from man now? No one glows now."</p><p>"Vladimir, haven't you noticed a great distinction even now? Man's gaze distinguishes everything earthly—the little blade of grass, the ferocious beast, and the stone—with delayed thought. It is mysterious and puzzling and filled with an inexplicable force. Man's gaze can both caress and also shroud everything alive in the chill of destruction. Tell me, for example, haven't you ever been warmed by someone's gaze? Or perhaps have you had an unpleasant feeling inside from certain eyes?"</p><p>"Yes, basically, I have. Sometimes you feel as though someone is looking at you. Looking pleasantly or not very."</p><p>"There, you see? That means you know that a caressing gaze will create a pleasant warmth inside you, and a different gaze brings destruction, a chill. But in the first days, man's gaze was many times more powerful. The Creator made it so that everything living strove to be warmed by this gaze."</p><p>"Has all the power of man's gaze gone?"</p><p>"Not all. Enough of it remains, but vanity, superficial thinking, a different speed of thought, a false concept of the essence, and sluggish apprehension cloud the gaze and keep that which everyone expects from man from being revealed. Each person holds his soul's warmth inside. If only it were all revealed in everyone! All waking reality could be transformed into a beautiful, primordial garden."</p><p>"For all people? As it was in the beginning for Adam? Could such a thing really come to be?"</p><p>"Everything can come to be, and this is what human thought strives for, merging from all into one.</p><p>"When Adam was alone, the power of his thought was the same as all humanity's right now."</p><p>"Oh ho! Is this why the lion was afraid of him?"</p><p>"The lion was not afraid of man. The lion was bowing to his grace-filled light. Everything there is strives to know grace, which man alone can create. For this, everything, and not only on Earth, is prepared to sense man as a friend, brother, god. Parents always strive to instill all the best abilities in their children. Only parents sincerely want their children's ability to exceed theirs. The Creator gave man—his son—in abundance everything to which He himself had striven in a burst of inspiration. If everyone is capable of understanding that God is perfect, then let everyone feel with the feelings of parents everything God the parent strove to create for His child, His beloved son-man: how not to fear responsibility and how to bind oneself forever to God and not renounce His creation, having said the words that have reached us after millions of years: "He is My son: man. He is My image! My likeness."</p><p>"So, you mean God wanted His son, his creation—well, man—to be stronger than He was?"</p><p>"The aspirations of all parents confirm this."</p><p>"So Adam on the very first day vindicated God's dreams? What did he do after he encountered the lion?"</p><p>"Adam strove to know all that is and to give each creature a name and purpose. Sometimes he solved the task quickly; sometimes he spent a long time on it. How hard he tried, for example, on his first day, before nightfall, to determine a purpose for the brontosaurus, but he couldn't. And so all the brontosauruses vanished from the Earth."</p><p>"Vanished? Why?"</p><p>"They vanished because man did not give them a purpose."</p><p>"And brontosauruses, are those he ones that are several times larger than elephants?"</p><p>"Yes, they are larger than elephants, and they had small wings, and a small head on a long neck. They could also breathe fire."</p><p>"Like in the fairytale. The dragon Gorynych, for example, breathed fire, too, in the fairytales. But that's in fairytales, not real life."</p><p>"Sometimes fairytales talk about past reality allegorically, and sometimes precisely."</p><p>"Is that so? But what was the monster made of? How can a living animal breathe fire? Or is the fire an allegory? For instance, did the monster breathe malice?"</p><p>"The huge brontosaurus was good, not bad. Its outward volume served to ease its weight."</p><p>"How can a great volume serve to ease weight?"</p><p>"The more a balloon is filled with lighter air, the lighter it is."</p><p>"What does a brontosaurus have to do with this? It's not a balloon."</p><p>"The brontosaurus was an enormous living sphere. The construction of its skeleton was light, and his internal organs small. Inside, like in a balloon, the emptiness was filled constantly with gas, which is lighter than air. If the brontosaurus took a little jump and flapped its wings, it could fly a short way. When there was an excess of gas, it exhaled it through its mouth. Flint-like fangs poked from its mouth, and their friction could create a spark, and the gas coming out of the belly would ignite and flame would burst from its mouth."</p><p>"That's great! Wait, who kept it filled with gas?"</p><p>"I'm telling you, Vladimir, the gas was produced inside when it digested its food."</p><p>"That can't be. There is only natural gas in the bowels of the Earth. They take it out of there and then fill balloons with the gas or send them to stoves through pipes, to the kitchen. But this is from food? It's all that simple?"</p><p>"Yes, it is."</p><p>"I don't believe in that simplicity, and I don't think anyone is going to believe it. In fact, everything you said is doubtful, and people will doubt not only what you said about the brontosaurus but everything else. So I'm not going to write about this."</p><p>"Vladimir, do you think I can be wrong, that I can lie?"</p><p>"I don't know about lying, but about you being wrong about the gas, that's for sure."</p><p>"I'm not wrong."</p><p>"Prove it."</p><p>"Vladimir, your stomach and other people's produce the same kind of gas today."</p><p>"That can't be."</p><p>"You verify it. Go and light it when it comes out of you."</p><p>"How out of me? Where? Light it where?"</p><p>Anastasia burst out laughing, and through her laughter said, "You're just like a child. Think yourself, this is an intimate experiment."</p><p>I thought about this gas from time to time. Why did it nag at me so? Eventually I decided to conduct the experiment, after I got back from seeing Anastasia. It burns! I remember everything she said about Adam's first days or our first days with increasing interest. I feel that for some reason we have forgotten to take something from them into today. Or only I forgot. Actually, let each person decide everything for himself when he finds out how man's first day went. Here is how Anastasia spoke of it.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0404>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>4. The First Day</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>"Adam was interested in everything. Every blade of grass, the intricately detailed bug, and the birds in the skies and the water. When he saw a stream for the first time, he admired it at length, the clear water racing, sparkling in the sun, and he saw the variety of life in it. Adam touched the water. The current immediately embraced his hand and caressed all the folds of the skin on his hand, drawing him toward it. He plunged into the water, and his body immediately became lighter, the water held him up, and murmuring, caressed his whole body right there. Casting the water up with his palms, he admired the way the Sun's rays played in every drop of water, and then the current received the drops again. Adam drank the water from the river joyously, and until the Sun set, admired it, contemplated it, and bathed again."</p><p>"Wait, Anastasia. You said he drank, but did Adam eat anything that whole day? What kind of food did he eat?"</p><p>"Around him were many different-tasting fruits, berries, and herbs good for eating. But Adam did not feel hunger in the first days. He was full from the air."</p><p>"The air? You can't be full from air. There's even a saying about that."</p><p>"Man truly cannot feed on the air he breathes now. Today the air has been deadened and is often toxic to the flesh and soul. You referred to the saying that you can't be full from air, but there is another: 'I fed on air alone." It corresponds to what man was presented with in the beginning. Adam was born in a beautiful garden, and in the surrounding air there was not a single harmful speck of pollen. In that air, the pollen was dissolved and there were drops of the purest dew."</p><p>"Pollen? What kind?"</p><p>"Flower and grass pollen, pollen shed from the trees and fruits of the ether—those nearby and others from faraway places brought on the wind. At that time, the problems of finding food never distracted man from his great works. Everything around fed him through the air. The Creator made this all so from the beginning, that everything living on Earth in a surge of love strove to serve man; the air, water, and breeze were life-giving."</p><p>"Now you're right here. Air can be very harmful, but man invented the air conditioner. It cleans the air of harmful particles. Also, they sell bottled mineral water. So that now, for the many who aren't poor, the problems of air and water have been solved."</p><p>"Unfortunately, Vladimir, the air conditioner does not solve the problem. It retains the harmful particles, but it deadens the air even more. The water kept in sealed bottles dies from being sealed up. It only feeds the flesh's old cells. For new birth, for the cells of your flesh to be constantly renewed, you need living air and water."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0405>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>5. Problems Affirm Life's Perfection</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>"Adam had all that?"</p><p>"He did! His thought raced very fast. In a relatively short period, he was able to determine a purpose for everything. One hundred eighteen years raced by like a single day."</p><p>"One hundred eighteen years—Adam lived alone until deep old age?"</p><p>"Alone, doing things breathtakingly interesting, Adam lived—the first man. One hundred eighteen years brought him not decrepitude but a flourishing."</p><p>"In one hundred eighteen years a man ages. He's considered a long-liver, and diseases and infirmities overtake him."</p><p>"That is now, Vladimir, but then diseases did not affect man. The age of each fleshly cell of his was longer, but if a cell did tire out and it was meant to die off, then immediately a new one full of energy came to take the old cell's place. Human flesh could live as many years as its spirit, or soul, wished."</p><p>"And what happens when that present-day man himself does not want to live longer?"</p><p>"By his own deed, he shortens his age by the second. Man invented death for himself."</p><p>"How can he have invented it? It comes of its own accord, against his will."</p><p>"When you smoke or drink alcohol, when you go to a city and the air is saturated with the stench of burning, when you take dead food and eat yourself up with malice, tell me, Vladimir, who if not you alone brings your own death closer?"</p><p>"Everyone has that kind of life now."</p><p>"Man is free. Each person builds his own life himself and determines his age down to the second."</p><p>"Do you mean to say that then, in paradise, there were no problems?"</p><p>"If problems did arise, they were resolved without damage and affirmed the perfection of life."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0406>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>6. The First Encounter</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>One day, in his one hundred eighteen years, awakening with the morning light, Adam did not admire the spring and did not rise to greet the sun's rays, as he always had before.</p><p>The nightingale's song cascaded through the leaves overhead. Adam turned on his other side, away from the nightingale's song.</p><p>With suppressed apprehension at his gaze, spring filled the space, the river called to Adam with its gurgling water, and the swallows frisked overhead. The clouds shifted their whimsical shapes. The gentlest fragrance rushed from the grasses, flowers, trees, and bushes to envelop him. Oh, how God marveled then! Amid the springtime magnificence and earthly creation, under the sky's blue, His son, man, mourned. His beloved child was full of sadness, not joy. Can there be anything sadder for a loving father than such a scene?</p><p>For the one hundred eighteen peaceful years from the time of creation, the many divine energies in repose went into motion instantly. The whole universe fell still. A great acceleration, never before seen, shone in the halo of the energy of Love, which all living things understood: God had conceived of a new creation. But what else could be created after what had been created at the limit of inspiration? No one yet could understand this then. But the speed of God's thought increased. The energy of Love whispered to Him,</p><p>"Once again you have put everything into inspired motion. Your universal energies are igniting the space. How can you not burst into flames yourself from such ardor? Where are you heading? What are you striving for? I am no longer seen by you. Look, my God, I am burning with you, I am turning the planets into stars. Stop! All the best has been created by you. Your son's sadness will disappear. Stop, God!"</p><p>God did not hear Love's entreaty and did not heed the mockery of the universal essences. Like a young and ardent sculptor, he continued the acceleration of all His energies' movement. And all of a sudden, an unprecedented beauty shone like the dawn through all the vast Universe, and everything there gasped, and God himself whispered in admiration:</p><p>"Look, Universe! Look! Here is my daughter standing amid the earthly creations. How perfect, how beautiful all her features are! She will be worthy of my son. There is no creation more perfect than she. In her is my image and likeness, and all your particles are in her, so love her. Love her!</p><p>"She and he—my son and my daughter—will bring joy to all that is, and will build beautiful universal worlds at all planes of being!"</p><p>From the knoll, over the dew-washed grass, on this festive day, in the ray of sunrise, a maiden walked toward Adam. Graceful was her walk, slender her figure, her body's curves smooth and gentle, and the tints of her skin held the light of the Divine dawn. Closer and closer she came. There she was! The maiden stood before Adam, who lay in the grass.</p><p>A breeze straightened her golden tresses, revealing her brow. The Universe held its breath. Oh, how beautiful her visage—your creation, God!</p><p>Lying in the grass, Adam merely glanced at the maiden who had come up next to him, yawned lightly, and turned away, closing his eyes.</p><p>Then all the universal essences heard, no, not words—they heard Adam listlessly pondering God's new creation in his thoughts. "Well, here it is. One more creation of some sort has approached. There is nothing new about it except for a resemblance to me. Horses' knees are both sturdier and more flexible. The leopard's hide is more vivid and cheerful. Furthermore, it approached without invitation, whereas today I wanted to give the ants a new purpose."</p><p>Eve, after standing close to Adam for a little while, went to a slough in the river, sat by the bushes on the shore, and examined her reflection in the quiet waters.</p><p>The universal essences began to murmur and their thoughts merged into one: "The two perfections were unable to appreciate each other. There is no perfection in God's creations."</p><p>Only the energy of Love, alone amid the universal murmuring, tried to guard the Creator. Its glow surrounded God. Everyone knew that the energy of Love never reasoned. Invisible and taciturn, it always strayed in unknown expanses. But why now was it shining so around God, giving its all? Not heeding the universal murmurs, it only warmed and consoled with its shining.</p><p>"Rest, Great Creator, and instill understanding in Your son. You can correct any of Your beautiful creations."</p><p>In response the Universe heard those words and through them came to know both the wisdom and the greatness of God.</p><p>"My son is My image and likeness. There are particles of all the universal energies in him. He is the alpha and omega. He is creation! He is the future transubstantiation! Henceforth and in all to come, neither I nor anyone may change his fate against his wishes. All he himself desires will be given him. What has been conceived will not come to pass in vanity. My son has not bowed down at the sight of the flesh of the maiden's perfection. He has not wondered, to the wonder of the whole Universe. He has not yet apprehended, but My son has sensed with his feelings. He was first to sense that he was lacking something. The new creation, the maiden, does not possess what he is lacking. My son! My son senses the entire Universe with his feelings, he knows everything that the Universe possesses.</p><p>A question filled the whole Universe: "What can be lacking in that which has all our energies and all Your energies?"</p><p>And God answered them all: "The energy of Love."</p><p>And the energy of Love blazed up: "But I am one, and I am Yours. I shine by You alone."</p><p>"Yes! You are one, My love," the Divine words were heard in response. "Your shining light glows and caresses, My love. You are inspiration. You can accelerate everything. You sharpen sensations, and you are the conciliation of repose, My love. I beg of you, descend to Earth, every last bit of you. Envelop them, My children, with yourself, with the energy of your great grace."</p><p>The farewell between Love and God heralded the beginning of all earthly love.</p><p>"My God," Love called to the Creator. "When I leave, You alone, invisible, forever, will abide on all living planes of being, invisible, forever."</p><p>"May my son and My daughter shine in the Next, the Now, and the True."</p><p>"My God, there will be a vacuum around You. No vivifying warmth will ever penetrate to Your Soul. Without this warmth, your Soul will grow cold."</p><p>"May warmth shine from Earth for all that is, not only for Me. Let it multiply My sons and daughters' deeds, and may the whole Earth shine in space with the warmth of love. Everyone will feel the grace-filled light of Earth, and all my energies will be able to warm them."</p><p>"My God, many different paths are open to Your son and daughter. They have in them the energies of all planes of being. But if just one predominates and leads them on the wrong path, what can You do? Have You given them everything only to see the energy coming from the Earth melting, weakening? You who have given everything only to see destructive energy dominating over all. Your creations cover up with a lifeless crust. Your grass scattered with stones. What will You do then, after Your son all Your freedom?"</p><p>"Amid the stones, I can poke through again as a green blade of grass. On a small untouched lawn I can open the petals of my flower. My earthly daughters and sons will be able to apprehend their purpose."</p><p>"My God, when I leave, you will become invisible to all. Essences of other energies may suddenly start speaking through people in Your name. Some will try to subordinate others to themselves. Interpreting Your essence for their own benefit, they will say, 'I am speaking to please God. I alone of everyone have been chosen by Him. Everyone, listen to me!' What can You do then?"</p><p>"With the coming day, I will rise as the dawn. The Sun's ray, caressing all creations on Earth, without exception, will help My daughters and sons to understand that each can speak with me, soul to Soul."</p><p>"They will be many, and You are one. For all universal essences, it will be their desire to seize the human soul, merely to assert themselves over all through people with their energy, and Your prodigal son will suddenly begin to pray to them."</p><p>"There is one main obstacle to the diversity of reasons leading to an impasse, to nowhere; it will be a bar to everything that bears a lie. My sons and daughters aspire to understanding the truth. A lie always has bounds, but the truth is boundless. It is one, and understanding will always be found in the soul of My daughters and sons!"</p><p>"My God, no one and nothing can resist Your flight of thought and dreams. They are beautiful! I will follow their trail with my will. I will warm Your children with my glow and will serve them eternally. The inspiration You bestow will help them bring their own creations into being. I ask You just one thing, my God. Allow me to leave just one spark of my love with You.</p><p>"When you come to sit in darkness, when there is only a vacuum all around, when there is oblivion and the light of Earth dims, let a spark, just one spark of my love for You, shine."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh Vladimir!" Anastasia exclaimed. "If only living man could look at the sky that embraced the Earth then, a great vision would appear before him."</p><p> </p><p>Universal light, the energy of Love, dense as a comet, sped toward the Earth. On its path, it illuminated the bodies of the still lifeless planets and ignited the stars over the Earth. Toward the Earth! Closer and closer. Here it is. Suddenly, stopping right over the Earth itself, the glow of Love began to tremble. In the distance, alone among the burning stars, the smallest star of all seemed alive. It sped toward Earth after the glow of love. Love realized it was its last spark from God and it raced after it toward Earth.</p><p>"My God," the glow of Love whispered. "Why? I have no solution. Why did You not keep even one spark of mine next to You?"</p><p>To the words of Love, out of the universal darkness, no longer visible to anyone, still not understood by anyone, God gave his answer. His Divine words were heard:</p><p>"Keeping it for myself means not giving it to My daughters and sons."</p><p>"My God . . .'"</p><p>"How beautiful you are, Love, even one spark."</p><p>"My God . . ."</p><p>"Hurry, My Love! Hurry without reasoning. Hurry with your last spark and warm all My future sons and daughters."</p><p>"The universal energy of Love embraced Earth's people—all of it, down to the last spark. Everything was in it. Amid the vast Universe, on all living planes of being simultaneously, Man rose up more powerful than all essences."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0407>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>7. When There is Love</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Adam lay on the grass, among the fragrant flowers. Under the canopy of trees he dozed, and his thoughts flowed languidly. Suddenly, the memory of an unknown wave of warmth embraced him, the warmth accelerated all his thoughts with a certain force: "Not long ago, a new creation stood before me. It resembled me, although with a difference. But what was that difference? Where is that creation now? Oh, how I want to see it again, though I don't know why!"</p><p>Adam rose quickly from the grass and looked around. A thought blazed up: "What has just happened? It is the same sky, birds, grass, trees, and bushes. Everything appears the same, but there is a difference. I am looking at everything differently. All earthly creatures and smells, the air and light, have become more beautiful."</p><p>And a word was born on Adam's lips, as he exclaimed to all: "And I love in response!"</p><p>A new wave of warmth coming from the river immediately enveloped his whole body. He turned toward the warmth, and before him the new creation shone. Logic left his thoughts. His entire soul took pleasure in the vision, when suddenly he saw the maiden sitting on the shore by the river's slough. She looked not at the pure water but at him, her golden tresses tossed back. She caressed him with her smile, as if she had been waiting an eternity for him.</p><p>He walked up to her. When they looked at each other, Adam thought, "No one has eyes more beautiful than she does."</p><p>Out loud he said, "You're sitting by the water. The water is pleasant. Do you want to bathe in the river with me?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then do you want me to show you my creations?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"I gave them all their purpose. I will instruct them to serve you as well. Do you want to create a new creation with me?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>They bathed in the river and ran across the meadow. Oh, how the maiden's laughter cascaded when, climbing on the elephant, the now cheerful Adam danced for her. He named the maiden Eve.</p><p>The day was approaching sunset. The two people stood amid the glory of earthly being, and the colors, smells, and sounds delighted them. A subdued Eve meekly watched the evening set in. The flowers' petals folded into buds. The beautiful daytime visions receded into the darkness.</p><p>"You mustn't be sad," Adam said, now confident of himself. "The darkness of night will begin now. We need it in order to rest, but no matter how much night comes, day always returns."</p><p>"Will it be the same day or a new day?" Eve asked.</p><p>"Whatever day you want will return."</p><p>"In whose power is each day?"</p><p>"Mine."</p><p>"And in whose power are you?"</p><p>"No one's."</p><p>"Where are you from?"</p><p>"A dream."</p><p>"And where is everything caressing my gaze from?"</p><p>"Also from a dream, a creation for me."</p><p>"Then where is the one whose dream is so beautiful?"</p><p>"He is often nearby, only the ordinary gaze does not see Him. But it is still good with Him. He calls himself God, my father and friend. He never bothers me and gives me everything. I want to give to Him, too, but I still don't know what."</p><p>"That means I am His creation, too. I, too, like you, want to thank Him and call him my friend, God, father. Perhaps together you and I can decide what acts of ours the Father expects from us."</p><p>"I heard him say that joy can be brought to everything."</p><p>"Everything? You mean, to Him as well?"</p><p>"Yes, to Him as well."</p><p>"Tell me what He desires."</p><p>"Joint creation and joy from contemplation of Him."</p><p>"What can bring joy for everyone?"</p><p>"Birth."</p><p>"Birth? Everything beautiful is born."</p><p>"Often before I fall asleep, I think about an unusual and beautiful creation. At day's beginning, sleep falls away and I see before I've begun to think, everything beautiful and visible in the light of day."</p><p>"Let us think together."</p><p>"Before I fell asleep by your side, I too wanted to listen to your breathing, to feel your warmth, to think of creating together.</p><p>"Before I fell asleep, in my dreams about the beautiful creation, in a burst of tender feelings for each other, our thoughts embraced and merged into a single aspiration. Our two material bodies reflected what had been imagined. . . ."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0408>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>8. Birth</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>The day returned—and night came once again. One day, at daybreak, when Adam was considering the tiger cubs and thinking, Eve quietly walked up, sat down beside him, took his hand, and put Adam's hand on her belly.</p><p>"Feel here, inside me, my creation, a new creation, alive. Do you feel it, Adam? Jostling? My restless creation?"</p><p>"Yes, I do. I think it is trying to reach me."</p><p>"You? Of course! It is mine, but it is also yours! I so want to see our creation."</p><p>Eve gave birth, not in agony but in great wonder.</p><p>Forgetting his entire surroundings, not feeling himself, Adam watched and trembled with impatience. Eve gave birth to a new joint creation.</p><p>A tiny bundle, all wet, lay helplessly on the grass. Little legs curled up, its eyes not opening. Adam watched steadily as it moved its little hand, opened its lips, and exhaled. Adam was afraid to blink for fear of missing the slightest movement. Unknown feelings filled everything inside him and around. Unable to stay in one place, Adam jumped up and suddenly set off at a run.</p><p>In great exultation, Adam ran headlong down the riverbank, for the pure sake of running. He stopped. In his chest something beautiful and unknown kept expanding and growing. And everything around him! . . . The breeze did not simply rustle the bushes' leaves. It sang as it combed through the bushes' leaves and the flowers' petals. The clouds did not simply sail in the sky. All the clouds danced enchantingly. The water sparkled, smiled, and flowed quickly. Well, of course! The river! Reflecting the clouds, the river bent in a new way before his gaze. And the joyous chirping of birds in the sky! The exultant chirring in the grasses! Everything merged into the single sound of the magnificent, gentle music of the most beautiful universe.</p><p>Taking more air into his chest, Adam suddenly shouted with all his strength. His shout was unusual, not bestial. Instead, it spilled the gentlest of sounds. Everything around him quieted. For the first time, the Universe heard man sing, standing on Earth, rejoicing and singing. Man sang! And everything heard before in the galaxies fell silent. Man sang! Hearing the song of happiness, the universal world understood that there is no string in any galaxy capable of emitting a better sound than the sound of the human soul in song.</p><p>But the song of exultation could not reduce the excess of feelings. Adam saw the lion and rushed toward it. He tumbled the lion to the ground, like a kitten, he started ruffling its mane, laughing, then he jumped up, beckoned to the lion, and started to run. The lion could barely keep up with him, and the cubs and lioness fell way behind. Adam ran fastest of all and waved his arms, beckoning all the creatures to follow him on his way. He believed his creation would help bring joy to everyone.</p><p>And here he was before him again, the little bundle. His creation! Licked by the she-wolf and caressed by the warm breeze, the little bundle, alive.</p><p>The infant had yet to open his eyes: he was asleep. All the beasts that had run up with Adam dropped to the ground before him in bliss.</p><p>"This is wonderful!" Adam exclaimed in admiration. "A light akin to mine emanates from my creation. It may be stronger than mine since something unusual is even happening with me. All the creatures have fallen before him in bliss. That is what I wanted! I did it! I created! I created a beautiful, living creation. Everyone! Everyone look at him."</p><p>Adam cast a glance all around, and suddenly he stopped, his gaze fell still, on Eve.</p><p>She was sitting in the grass alone, lightly caressing the suddenly quiet Adam with her weary gaze.</p><p>The love inside and around Adam radiated invisible bliss with new force. Suddenly . . . Oh, how universal love trembled when Adam ran up to the beautiful maiden-mother, when he dropped to his knees before Eve and touched her golden tresses, her lips, and her milk-filled breast, when he compressed his amazement into a gentle whisper and tried to speak of his admiration.</p><p>"Eve! My Eve! My woman! You are capable of making dreams come true?"</p><p>A little weary, her gentle, quiet voice replied: "Yes, I am a woman, your woman. We will make everything you can imagine come true!"</p><p>"Yes! Together! We are together! Now it is clear! We are together! We are like Him! We are capable of making dreams come true! Look! Our Father, do you hear us?"</p><p>But for the first time Adam did not hear an answer.</p><p>Surprised, he jumped up and shouted, "Where are You, my Father? Look at my creation! Your earthly creatures are perfect, strange. Everything is beautiful—trees, grasses, bushes, and clouds—but more beautiful than the lines of a flower. Look! My creation has brought me more joy than everything you created with your dream. You are silent. You don't want to look at him? But he is the best of all! My creation speaks to my soul most of all. What is the matter with You? Don't you want to look at him?"</p><p>Adam looked at the infant. The air above the infant's little awakened body was bluer than usual, and no breeze ruffled anything, only someone invisible bent a slender stem over the infant's lips, bending the flower. And three gentle puffs of flower pollen touched the infant's lips. He—the infant—smacked his lips, sighed blissfully, moved his little arm and leg, and fell back to sleep. Adam guessed that while he was exulting, God was cherishing the infant, and so was silent.</p><p>Adam exclaimed, "That means you helped! That means you were nearby and recognized our creation?"</p><p>And he heard the Father's quiet voice: "Not so loudly, Adam. You'll wake the child with your exultation."</p><p>"You mean, my Father, that You have come to love my creation, as You do me? Or do You love him more than me? If so, why? Explain! It isn't Yours, after all."</p><p>"Love, my son, has a continuation; your continuation is in the new creation."</p><p>"You mean, I am here and in him simultaneously? And Eve is in him, you mean?"</p><p>"Yes, My son, your creation is akin to you in all things, not only in the flesh. In him, spirit and soul, merging, give birth to something new. Your aspirations will continue, and the joyous feelings will strengthen many times over."</p><p>"So there will be many of us?"</p><p>"You will fill the whole Earth. You will apprehend everything through feeling, and then in other galaxies your dream will create a world even more beautiful."</p><p>"Where is the Universe's edge? What will I do when I come to it? When will I fill everything myself and create what I have imagined?"</p><p>"My son, the Universe is thought. The dream was born out of thought. It is partially visible in matter. When you reach the edge of everything, your thought will discover a new beginning and continuation. A beautiful new birth will arise from nothing, reflecting you and your aspirations, soul, and dream. My son, you are infinite, you are eternal, your creative dreams are in you."</p><p>"Father, how good it always is when You speak. When You are nearby, I want to embrace You. But you are invisible. Why?"</p><p>"My son, when My dreams of you were taking in the universal energies, I didn't have time to think about Myself. My dreams and thoughts created only you; they did not create my visible image. But there are my creations, which are visible, and you must sense them, you must not try to examine them. No one in the entire Universe can examine them with just his mind."</p><p>"Father, I feel good when You speak. You are nearby, always nearby. When I find myself at the other end of the Universe, when I have doubts or something incomprehensible in my soul, tell me, how will I find you? Where will you be then?"</p><p>"In you and nearby. Everything is inside you, My son. You are master of all the Universe's energies. I balanced all the Universe's opposites in you, and in this way you are something new. Do not let any one of them predominate in you. Then I will be in you as well."</p><p>"In me?"</p><p>"In you and nearby. You and Eve are in your creation. In you there is a particle of Me, and so I am in your creation, too."</p><p>"I am son to you. Who will the new creation be for you?"</p><p>"You once again."</p><p>"Who will you love more, the me who I am now, or the me that is born over and over again?"</p><p>"Love is one, there is more and more hope in each new embodiment and dream."</p><p>"Father, how wise You are, and I how I want to embrace You!"</p><p>"Look around. My creations are visible, my materialized thoughts and dreams. You can always interact with them on your material plane of being."</p><p>"I have come to love You. How I love You, Father! And I have come to love Eve, and my new creation. Love is all around, and I want to live in it eternally."</p><p>"My son, only in the dimension of Love will you live eternally.</p><p>"Years have passed, if I can put it this way, but time is only a convention, after all. Years have passed, but what is the point of counting? For a long time, man could not know death in himself, and that means death could not exist then."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0409>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>9. The Apple That Cannot Satisfy</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>"Anastasia, if everything was so good in the beginning, what happened afterward? Why are there wars on Earth and why are people going hungry? We have stealing, criminals, suicides, prisons. There are plenty of unhappy families and orphaned children. Where did the loving Eves go? Where is God, Who promised we would all live in love eternally? Actually, I remember that the Bible talks about this. Because man picked the apple from the forbidden tree and tasted it, God drove man out of paradise. He even put a guard at the gates to keep the mischief makers out of paradise."</p><p>"Vladimir, God did not drive man out of paradise."</p><p>"Yes he did. I read about it. He also cursed man at the same time. He told Eve she was a sinner and would give birth in agony, and Adam would obtain his food by the sweat of his brow. That is how everything happens with us now in real life."</p><p>"Vladimir, think this through yourself. Perhaps that logic or the absence of it is to someone's advantage. Perhaps it has its own purpose."</p><p>"What do logic and someone's purpose have to do with this?"</p><p>"Please, believe me. Each must learn himself to examine things with his soul and define reality. Only by thinking things through yourself can you understand that God did not drive man out of paradise. God to this day remains the all-loving Father. He, God, is Love. You read about that, too."</p><p>"Yes, I did."</p><p>"So where is the logic? After all, a loving parent would never drive his child out of his home. A loving parent, enduring deprivation himself, forgives his children any transgression. Nor does God gaze impartially on all the sufferings of people, his children."</p><p>"Whether He gazes or not, I don't know. But it is clear to everyone that He does nothing to counter it."</p><p>"What are you saying, Vladimir? Of course, He will bear this pain from his son-man. But how much can one fail to perceive the Father, fail to sense His Love, not see it?"</p><p>"Why are you getting so worked up? Speak more specifically. Where and in what are the present-day manifestations of God's Love for us?"</p><p>"When you are in the city, take a closer look around you. The living carpet of the most marvelous grass is covered with lifeless asphalt. There are hulks called homes, made of harmful concrete, all around, and cars move to an fro between them, emitting deadly gas. But among the stone hulks, if they find just a small island, blades of grass will come up, as will flowers—God's creations. From the leaves' rustling and the birds' singing He keeps calling to his daughters and sons to make sense of what is happening and to return to paradise.</p><p>"Love's illumination keeps decreasing from the Earth and the son's reflection would have dimmed altogether long ago. But with His energy He indefatigably strengthens the stuff of life and the Sun's rays. As before, He loves his daughters and sons. He believes, waits, and dreams that one day, with the next dawn, man will suddenly comprehend, and that his comprehension will return the original flowering to Earth."</p><p>"But how did everything happen on Earth despite God's dreams? How did they last I don't know how many thousands or maybe millions of years? How can anyone keep waiting and believing all that time?"</p><p>"For God, time does not exist. As in a loving parent, faith does not vanish in Him. Thanks to that faith, we are all alive right now. We ourselves are creating life, enjoying the freedom our Father has given us. But people did not choose the path leading to nowhere all of a sudden."</p><p>"If not all of a sudden, then when? What does 'Adam's apple' mean?"</p><p>"In those times, as now, the Universe was filled with many living energies. Living essences are invisible everywhere, and many of them resemble the second human 'I.' They are almost like people, they are capable of encompassing all planes of being, except the material. Herein lies man's advantage over them. One energy always predominates in the set of energies of universal essences. They do not have the ability to change the correlation of their energies.</p><p>"Also among the universal essences are sets of energies akin to God. Akin, but they are not gods. For an instant they can balance the multitude of energies in themselves, but they cannot create living creations in harmony, like God.</p><p>"No one in the entire Universe has been able to find the solution, to reveal the innermost secret, the power with which the material plane was created, and where, in what, the threads connecting it and the entire universal essence lie. How, at whose expense, can this plane reproduce itself?</p><p>
"When God created the Earth and everything in it, then due to the speed of the unprecedented creation, the essences were unable to comprehend the force God used to produce the universe. When everything was created and visible, when they saw that man was most powerful of all, the beautiful vision plunged many first in wonderment and admiration, and the desire grew in them to repeat it, to create the same thing, but their own. This desire kept growing. Even now it remains in many of the essences' energies. They have tried to create something like Earth in other galaxies and other worlds. They have even used the planets God created. Many have achieved a likeness of earthly being, but only a likeness. No one has been able to achieve an Earth of harmony and interconnection of everything with everything. Thus, there are to this day planets with life in the Universe, but a life that is merely a distortion of earthly life.</p><p>"When out of many attempts—not only to create something better but to repeat it—everything proved to be in vain (and God did not disclose his secret), then many of the essences began to turn to man. It was clear to them that if God's creation was man, if he was loved, in loving the loving parent could not refuse to give him anything. On the contrary, God could present man, His son, with great resources. So the universal essences began to turn to man and strive to do so to this day. Even today, some people assert that someone invisible talks to them from somewhere in the cosmos and calls itself the intellect and the force of good. So too, at the very beginning, they came to man first with instruction, then with a request. The essence of all the questions remained the same. It was merely masked differently. 'Tell us how, by what power, the Earth and everything in it was created, and how, out of what, you were created great, man?'</p><p>"But man never did give any of them an answer. He himself did not know the answer to that question, nor does he now. But interest in him rose, and man began demanding answers to that question from God. God did not simply not answer. He tried to reason with man and asked him to eliminate the question from his thoughts.</p><p>"'I beg of you, My son, create. You have been given to create in the earthly expanse and in other worlds. What has been conceived by your dream will come to pass. I ask only one thing, do not try to sort out with what force all this is accomplished.'"</p><p>"Anastasia, I don't understand why God didn't want to tell even man, His own son, about the technique of creation."</p><p>"I can only suppose. By not answering even His own son, God was trying to safeguard him from disasters and avert universal war."</p><p>"I don't see any connection between the absence of an answer and universal war."</p><p>"If the secret of creation were disclosed, then on the planets and in other universes forms of life equal to earthly forms could arise. The two forces would want to test each other. Possibly there could be peaceful competition, possibly something similar to earthly wars, thus laying the seeds for Universal war."</p><p>"Truly, better God's technique of creation stay a secret. Just so none of the essences figure it out themselves, without a hint."</p><p>"I don't think anyone ever will."</p><p>"Why are you so sure?"</p><p>"It is the kind of secret that is clear. There is no secret, and at the same there is more than one. The word 'creation' gives me confidence when you attach a second word to it."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"'Inspiration.'"</p><p>"But what does that make? What could those two words together mean?"</p><p>"They . . ."</p><p>"No! Stop! Quiet! I remembered you said that thoughts, and that means words, too, do not vanish into nowhere but hover in the dimension around us and anyone can hear them. Is that true?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And the essences could hear them?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then quiet. Why give them a hint?"</p><p>"Vladimir, you mustn't worry. By revealing the secret to them slightly, I may be able in this way to show the fruitlessness and pointlessness of their tireless attempts. So that they understand and stop harassing man."</p><p>"If that's so, then tell me what 'creation' and 'inspiration' mean."</p><p>"Creation means what God created out of particles of all the universal energies, including His own. Even if all the essences assemble together to achieve something similar to Earth, they will not have enough of one energy—the one that as an idea is intrinsic to God, that was born in the Divine dream alone. 'Inspiration' means the creation made in a burst of inspiration. Which of your sculptors, your great artists, who created in a burst of inspiration, would later try to say how he held the brush, what he was thinking, where he was standing? Wholly engrossed in his work, He paid no attention to that. Furthermore, there is the energy of Love, sent to Earth by God. It is free, subservient to no one, and while maintaining its loyalty to God, serves only man."</p><p>"How interesting this all is, Anastasia! Do you think the essences will hear this and understand?"</p><p>"They will hear, and they may even understand."</p><p>"What I'm saying, will they hear that, too?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then I'll sum up for them again. Hey, essences, is it clear to you now? Is it? Don't go grasping at people anymore. It's not for you to divine the Creator's intention! Well, Anastasia, did I tell them well?"</p><p>"Your last words were very accurate: 'It's not for you to divine the Creator's intention!'"</p><p>"How long have they been trying to?"</p><p>"Since the moment they saw the Earth and men, right up to the present day."</p><p>"How have their attempts harmed Adam or us?"</p><p>"In Adam and Eve they aroused pride and egoism. They were able to convince them by false dogma: 'In order to create something more perfect than what is, you must break it open and see how the creation works.' They repeated this often. 'Know the construction of everything and you will tower over everything.' They hoped that when Adam began taking apart God's creations and understanding their structure and purpose, he would understand with his mind where the interconnection among all creations lay. They would see the thoughts Adam produced and understand how they too could create akin to God.</p><p>"At first, Adam ignored their advice and requests. But one day Eve decided to advise Adam. 'I hear it, voices saying that everything will be more beautiful and easier for us when you learn the structure inside everything. Why do we keep not agreeing with this advice? Would it not be better to follow it just once?'</p><p>"First Adam broke a branch off a tree with marvelous fruits on it, and then . . . Then . . . now you yourself see, creative thought in man came to a halt. Ever since then he has been taking apart and breaking everything open, to understand the structure of everything, and creating his own primitive things with his instantly halted thought."</p><p>"Anastasia, wait a minute. This is not entirely clear. Why do you think that human thought came to a halt? On the contrary, when people sort things out, it's called learning something new."</p><p>"Vladimir, man is made in such a way that he does not have to sort out anything. In him is . . . how can I say this more understandably? The entire construction is preserved as is in man, in an encoded form. The code is revealed when he puts his creative dream in inspiration."</p><p>"But it's still not clear what harm there can be from disassembling and why it halts thought. Why don't you show me by example."</p><p>"Yes, that's right. I'll try by example. Imagine you are driving behind the wheel toward a goal. It suddenly occurs to you to look at how the engine works, why the wheel turns. You stop your automobile and start disassembling its engine, for example."</p><p>"Well, if I do, I find out what's what there, and then I can repair it myself. What could be bad in that?"</p><p>"But while you are disassembling, your movement is halted. You will not reach your goal in time."</p><p>"On the other hand, I'll know more about the car. What is bad about me acquiring new knowledge?"</p><p>"What do you need it for? Your purpose is not to repair; it is to take pleasure in the movement and to create."</p><p>"You have not been convincing, Anastasia. Not a single driver would agree with you. Well, maybe those driving new foreign cars, Japanese makes or Mercedes, they rarely break down."</p><p>"God's creations not only do not break down, but they are capable of resurrecting themselves, so why disassemble them?"</p><p>"What do you mean why? If only for interest's sake."</p><p>"Forgive me, Vladimir, if my example was unsuccessful. Allow me to try to give another."</p><p>"Try away."</p><p>"A beautiful woman is standing in front of you. Desire for her is burning in you, she is to your liking, and she is not indifferent to you. She tries to unite with you in creation. But in the moments before a mutual surge of union, creation, it suddenly occurs to you to sort out what a woman is made of. How do her organs work inside? Her stomach, liver, kidneys? What does she eat? What does she drink? How will all this work in an intimate moment?"</p><p>"That's enough. Say no more. Here you've come up with a terrific example. There won't be any intimacy or creation. It won't work if that cursed thought comes. This happened to me once. I had long liked a certain woman, but she wouldn't give herself to me. When one day she did consent, I suddenly got to thinking how best to do everything and for some reason began to doubt my abilities. As a result, nothing worked. Such a disgrace! I had a real fright. Later I asked a friend, and he'd been through the same thing. He and I even went to see a doctor. The doctor told us that a psychological factor had come into play. We shouldn't have doubted and tried to sort out what was what. I think men have suffered quite a bit from that factor. Now I understand. All this is because of the essences and of Adam and Eve's advice. Yes, they behaved rather badly then."</p><p>"Why do you blame only Adam and Eve? Take a look today. Isn't all humanity stubbornly continuing to repeat their mistake, breaking God's commandments? The consequences were not clear to Adam and Eve, but why does humanity stubbornly continue taking everything apart, destroying living creations? Today! When the consequences are obvious and sad."</p><p>"I don't know. Maybe everyone needs a good shaking up? Have we gotten into a cycle of nothing but taking things apart? I just had the thought that it was too bad God did not really punish Adam and Eve. If He'd gone and slapped Adam upside the head to drive out the foolishness from which humanity is suffering now and given Eve a good switching in a soft spot so she wouldn't butt in with her advice."</p><p>"Vladimir, God gave man complete freedom and in his thoughts produced no punishments from Himself. In addition, what has been done in thoughts cannot be changed by punishment. Wrong actions will keep being created until the original thought is changed. For example—tell me what you think—who invented the death-dealing missile and its nuclear warhead?"</p><p>"In Russia, Academician Korolyov built the missiles. And before him Tsiolkovsky spoke about them theoretically. American scientists tried. Well, in general, many human minds have worked in rocket building. There are lots of inventors working in different countries."</p><p>"Vladimir, the inventor of all missiles and all lethal weapons for them is in fact only one."</p><p>"How can he be one when entire scientific institutes are working on creating missiles in different countries and they keep their achievements secret from each other? That's what the arms race means—who produces arms faster and better."</p><p>"Hints are gladly handed out to all the people who call themselves scientist-inventors, and independently of which country they live in, by him, the sole inventor."</p><p>"And where, in what country does he himself live and what is his name?"</p><p>"The thought of destruction. In the beginning, after getting through to one person and taking control of his material body, it produced the spear and stone point. Then it created the arrow and the iron arrowhead."</p><p>"But if it knows everything, this destructive thought, why didn't it produce a missile right away?"</p><p>"The material level of earthly existence does not immediately embody a conception. The Creator has given us a slowness in matter for comprehension. Destructive thought long ago produced the spear, what we have now for weapons, and what we will have in the future, much more lethal. Embodying more than a spear on the earthly material level required the construction of many plants and laboratories, which are now called scientific. On outwardly plausible pretexts, men were drawn more and more into implementations of lethal thought."</p><p>"But why does it need that? Why does it try so persistently?"</p><p>"To assert itself. To destroy Earth's entire material plane. To show the whole universe the superiority of the energies of its all-destroying essence over everything and over God. It acts through people."</p><p>"There, the viper, that sly viper! How are we to drive it from the Earth?"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0410>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>10. Intimate Connections with it have to be Avoided</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>"Do not allow it to penetrate you. All women should avoid intimate relations with men who have let in the thought of destruction, so as not to give birth to it over and over."</p><p>"Oh you! If all women colluded in this, scientific military minds would go crazy."</p><p>"Vladimir, if women would start acting on this, there would be no war on Earth."</p><p>"That's for sure. Anastasia, you really are onto something with all wars. You really are. Your idea could smash all wars. Truly, what man would want to fight if after that no woman would sleep with him or give him progeny? Anyone who starts a war ends up killing himself and all his descendants."</p><p>"If women want to do all that, no one would start a war. Eve's fall would be expiated before herself and God by the woman living today."</p><p>"What would happen then?"</p><p>"The Earth would flourish anew with the primordial flower."</p><p>"You are persistent, Anastasia, and you remain true to your dream. But you are also naïve. How can you believe in all the women on Earth?"</p><p>"How can I not believe in women, Vladimir, if I know that each woman living on Earth today has inside her the Divine essence. Let it be revealed in all its beauty. Let it! Goddesses! Women of the Divine Earth. Reveal the Divine essence in you. Show yourself to the entire Universe in your glory of the primary sources. A perfect creation, you are created from the Divine dream. You, each of you, is capable of pacifying the energies of the Universe. Women! Goddesses of all the Universe and Earth!"</p><p>"Anastasia, how can you say that all the women on Earth are goddesses? Your naïveté really makes me laugh. Just think! All of them goddesses. Even those who stand behind counters, at the different stores and kiosks? The cleaners, dishwashers, and waitresses? In the kitchen at home, day in and day out, always boiling and roasting and rattling dishes—they're goddesses, too? You yourself blaspheme. How can drug addicts and prostitutes be called goddesses? Well, maybe in a temple . . . or at a ball a beautiful lady dances, sometimes people say about them as well, 'She is a goddess.' But no one would ever call all the various unkempt creatures in unfashionable rags a goddess."</p><p>"Vladimir, every day the circumstances of modern life force earthly goddesses to stand in the kitchen. You said that I am like a wild animal, that my daily life is primitive, and that only the one you live in is civilized. Then why do the women in the civilization of your part of life spend their life in a cramped kitchen, forced to wash the floor and haul heavy things from the stores? You boast of your civilization, but why is there so much dirt in it? Why do you turn your very beautiful earthly goddesses into cleaning women?"</p><p>"Where have you ever seen a cleaning goddess? Those who are worth something, their beauty shines in contests and are drowned in luxury, and everyone wants to marry them. But they only marry rich men. And the poor don't need all the different neglected creatures."</p><p>"Each woman has her own beauty. Only she is not always given the chance to reveal herself. That great beauty cannot be measured, like a waist, for example. The length of leg, size of bust, and eye color are unimportant here. Beauty is inside the woman, and the young girl, and the elderly lady."</p><p>"Well yes, in elderly ladies, too. Now you're going to tell me about old lady pensioners! You think they're beautiful goddesses, too?"</p><p>"In their own way, they are beautiful. In spite of the sequence of life's humiliations, the many cracks in their fate, any woman who gets called granny can one morning apprehend, wake up with the dawn, walk through the dew, smile at the rising sun with a ray of comprehension, and then . . ."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Suddenly make someone love her. She herself will be loved, and she will give him the warmth of her love."</p><p>"Him who?"</p><p>"Her one and only, who apprehends the goddess in her."</p><p>"That doesn't happen."</p><p>"Yes, it does. You go ask old people. You'll find out how many ardent romances they have."</p><p>"And you're sure women can change the world?"</p><p>"Yes, they can! They can, without a doubt, Vladimir. By changing the priorities of their love, they—God's perfect creation—will give back to the Earth its beautiful original form, they will transform the whole Earth into the flowering garden of the Divine dream. They are God's creation! The beautiful goddesses of God's Earth!"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0411>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>11. Three Prayers</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>"Here you are talking about God, Anastasia, but how do you pray? Or do you not pray at all? Many people in their letters have requested that I ask you about this."</p><p>"Vladimir, what do you understand by the word 'pray'?"</p><p>"How's that? Is that so hard to understand? Praying . . . means praying. You mean you don't understand what the word means?"</p><p>"People perceive the same words differently and sense a different meaning behind them. I asked you so that I myself could speak more understandably. How do you understand the meaning of prayer?"</p><p>"I haven't thought much about the meaning. But I do know one prayer, the main one, by heart and sometimes I recite it, just in case. It must have some meaning, since so many recite it."</p><p>"And so? You memorized a prayer and didn't want to learn its meaning?"</p><p>"It's not that I didn't want to, I just never gave much thought to its meaning. I thought it was clear to everyone, so why give it any thought? A prayer is just a kind of conversation with God."</p><p>"But if by the main prayer with God we mean a conversation, tell me how you can speak to God, your Father, without meaning?"</p><p>"I don't know how. Why do you keep going on about this meaning? Whoever wrote the prayer must have known it."</p><p>"But wouldn't you like to speak with the Father for yourself?"</p><p>"Naturally. Each person would like to communicate with the Father for himself."</p><p>"But how can you 'for yourself' while uttering strangers' words, and without giving any thought to what stands behind them?"</p><p>At first I was a little irritated at Anastasia's insistence on the meaning of the prayer I'd learned, but later I myself got interested in determining it because somehow the thought occurred to me: "How did that happen? I learned a prayer, repeated it more than once, and barely thought about what was in it. It would be interesting to sort it out, since I memorized it."</p><p>I said to Anastasia, "All right, I'll give the meaning some thought somehow."</p><p>She replied, "What do you mean 'somehow'?" Do you mean right now, right here, you couldn't recite your prayer?"</p><p>"Why not? Of course I could."</p><p>"Then recite the prayer, Vladimir, the one you called chief of all and with the help of which you tried to talk to our Father."</p><p>"I only know the one. I memorized it because everyone else seemed to consider it the most important."</p><p>"So be it. Recite your prayer, and I will follow your thought."</p><p>"Fine. Listen."</p><p>I recited the Our Father to Anastasia. In it, if you recall, it says:</p><p> </p><p>Our Father, Who Art in heaven!</p><p>Hallowed be Thy name.</p><p>Thy kingdom come,</p><p>Thy will be done,</p><p>On earth as it is in heaven.</p><p>Give us this day our daily bread,</p><p>And forgive us our debts</p><p>As we forgive our debtors.</p><p>And lead us not into temptation,</p><p>But deliver us from evil.</p><p>For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory</p><p>Of the Father and Son and Holy Spirit,</p><p>Forever and ever. Amen.</p><p> </p><p>I fell silent and looked at Anastasia. She had dropped her head, not looking at me. She sat in silence, sorrowful, until I couldn't stand it and asked her, "Why are you silent, Anastasia?"</p><p>Without lifting her head, she said, "What do you want me to say, Vladimir?"</p><p>"What do you mean? I recited it without even a moment's hesitation. Did you like it? You could say, but you're silent."</p><p>"When you were reciting the prayer, Vladimir, I tried to follow your thought, feelings, and the meaning of the address. The words of the prayer are understandable, but you did not understand all the words in it. Your barely born thought rushed and got lost, and there were no feelings at all. You have not learned the meanings of many of the prayer's words and didn't address anyone. You were just muttering."</p><p>"Still I did recite the whole thing. I've been in church, and there are even more incomprehensible words there. Other people, I've heard them recite. They mumble lickety-split, and that's all. But I recited it all clearly and slowly, so you'd understand."</p><p>"But before this you said, 'Prayer is an address to God.'"</p><p>"You said that."</p><p>"But God is our Father, He is an individual, He is living substance. The Father is capable of feeling and understanding when normal contact is made. But you . . ."</p><p>"What about me? I'm telling you, that's how everyone recites when addressing God."</p><p>"Imagine your daughter Polina in front of you and all of a sudden she starts speaking in a monotone and weaving words into phrases that she herself doesn't understand. You, her father, would you like your daughter to address you like that?"</p><p>The moment I clearly pictured this situation, I felt awful. My daughter is standing in front of me and mumbling something like some kind of half-wit, she herself not understanding what she wants. I decided for myself: "No, I must sort out the prayer consciously. I shouldn't be repeating words unconsciously. Or else I stand before God like a half-witted dolt. Let other people mumble it that way. I must understand this entire prayer. Only I have to find a translation for the unclear words somewhere. And why do they speak that unclear language in churches?"</p><p>Out loud I said to Anastasia, "You know, the translation here must be incomplete and inaccurate. That's why, as you said, my thought was lost."</p><p>"Vladimir, you can understand the meaning from this translation, too. Of course, there are words in it that have gone out of use in everyday speech, but their meanings are clear when you think about them and determine what is most important for you and most pleasant for our Father. What do you want when you are uttering your prayerful address to our Father?"</p><p>"Well, what the words say—that's probably what I want. To give me bread, forgive my sins and debts, and not lead me into temptation, and rid me of evil. It's all clear there."</p><p>"Vladimir, God gave His sons and daughters all their food before they were born. Look around you. It was all done for you long ago. Our loving parent forgives sins for everyone without being asked and has no thought of leading anyone into temptation. Our Father gave each person the ability not to surrender to sinister promises. Why do you offend our Father with your ignorance of what He did long ago? Around you are all His eternal gifts. A loving parent who has given His child everything, what else can He give?"</p><p>"What if there is something He still hasn't given?"</p><p>"God is the ultimate. He presented His sons and daughters with everything from the beginning. Everything! In full! A parent devoted to His child, He could not imagine a greater good than joy from His children's joyous being! His sons and daughters!</p><p>"Tell me, Vladimir, what feelings might our Father have experienced who gave His children everything from the beginning and who sees His children standing before him praying to him continuously, 'More, more, protect us, save us, we are all helpless, we are all nothing'? Answer me, please. Here are you, a parent, or one of your friends, would you like to have children like that?"</p><p>"I'm not going to answer here right away. I'll sort this out myself, when I can think calmly."</p><p>"Yes, yes, of course, fine, Vladimir. Only please, when you do find the time, think what our Father would like to hear from you apart from your requests."</p><p>"So what, God, too, might want something from us? What?"</p><p>"The same thing each person wants to hear from his children."</p><p>"Tell me, Anastasia, do you ever say a prayer to God yourself?"</p><p>"Yes, I do," her answer came.</p><p>"Then recite me your prayer."</p><p>"I can't to you, Vladimir. My prayer is intended for God."</p><p>"Then for God, and I'll hear it."</p><p>Anastasia stood up, her arms spread, turned away from me, and spoke her first words. The ordinary words of a prayer, but . . . everything inside me seemed to throb suddenly. She spoke them the way we speak what is not a prayer. She spoke them the way people turn to their closest, most beloved, dearest person. Her speech had all the intonations of vibrant interaction: Passion, joy, and desperate ecstasy, and as if He to whom Anastasia had turned ardently was nearby:</p><p> </p><p>Our Father, who is everywhere, for Your</p><p>Great light, I thank You. And for making real</p><p>Your kingdom, thank You. For Your loving will,</p><p>I thank You. Be forever kind and good.</p><p> </p><p>For my daily food, I thank You! And for patience,</p><p>Forgiveness of the sins upon Your Earth.</p><p>My Father, who is everywhere! Your daughter</p><p>Among your creations, I shall not allow</p><p>Sin and weakness in myself, but stay</p><p>Deserving, worthy of Your accomplishments.</p><p> </p><p>My Father, who is everywhere! I am</p><p>Your daughter, your child who lives for your delight.</p><p>I shall multiply your glory with my self.</p><p>The coming ages shall all live inside</p><p>Your dream. So shall it be! So do I desire!</p><p>My Father, who is everywhere! I am</p><p>Your daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Anastasia fell silent. She continued to commune with everything around her. Light seemed to shine around her. When she was uttering the words of her prayer next to me, something invisible happened, and this something invisible touched me, too—on the inside, not the outside. It made me suddenly feel good and calm. But as Anastasia moved away, this feeling passed.</p><p>I said after her, as she moved away, "You recited your prayer as if someone were beside you capable of responding to it."</p><p>Anastasia turned to face me, and her face was joyful. She spread her arms out to the sides and spun, smiling, and then, looking me seriously in the eyes, said, "Vladimir, God our Father also speaks to each person with a prayer, answers each prayer."</p><p>"Why then does no one understand His words?"</p><p>"His words? There are so many words with different meanings among earthly nations. So many dissimilar languages and dialects. But there is one language for all, one language of Divine appeals for all. It is woven from the rustling of leaves, the singing of birds, and the waves. God's language has smells and color. God gives a prayerful answer in this language to each request and prayer."</p><p>"Could you translate what he is telling us into words?"</p><p>"Yes, approximately."</p><p>"Why approximately?"</p><p>"Our language is much poor than the one God speaks with us."</p><p>"Still, tell me as best you can."</p><p>Anastasia glanced at me, suddenly reached out in front of her, and her voice. . . . Her chest voice rang out:</p><p> </p><p>My son! My dearest son! I've waited long.</p><p>And I wait still. Years in a minute,</p><p>Ages in an instant, still I wait.</p><p>To you, I've given all the blessed Earth.</p><p>You're free in everything. You choose your path.</p><p>Still, I beg you, son, My dearest son,</p><p>Be happy, son, I beg you.</p><p>You do not see Me.</p><p>You do not hear Me.</p><p>In reason, there lurk doubts and tears.</p><p>You move away. To where?</p><p>You search. For what?</p><p>To whom do you bow down?</p><p>I stretch My hand to you,</p><p>My son, my dearest son.</p><p>Be happy, I beg you. You stray again</p><p>Along a path to nowhere. On this path,</p><p>the Earth explodes with deadly force.</p><p>You are free, and the Earth explodes,</p><p>Explodes your destiny.</p><p>You are free, yet I remain,</p><p>Reviving you with the last blade of grass.</p><p>And once again the glorious world will shine.</p><p>Be happy, I beg you. The faces of</p><p>The saints are full of grief. They frighten you</p><p>With hell and judgment. They tell you I come</p><p>To judge. And yet I merely pray for when</p><p>We are as one again.</p><p>I trust you will return.</p><p>I know you'll come again.</p><p>I shall embrace you once again,</p><p>Not a stepfather! No! I'm yours,</p><p>Your Abba Father! And you are My own son.</p><p>My dearest son,</p><p>May we find together joy!</p><p> </p><p>When Anastasia fell silent, it took me a while to regain my senses. It was as if I kept listening to everything around me, but maybe I was listening to the blood racing through my veins, inside me, in an unusual rhythm. What had I understood? To this day I myself don't understand.</p><p>She had set out in her ardent interpretation God's prayer to man. Whether the words are true or untrue, who's to say now? And why, who can explain why they aroused my feelings so powerfully? What am I doing now? Agitatedly, I run my hand over the page, with some comprehension or with none. Am I losing my mind? Do I weave her words with what the bards now sing in her name? It all may be. Perhaps others will understand for me, and I will try to understand when I finish writing. And I am writing again. But once again, as there, in the forest, as if breaking through a curtain, the lines of the taiga prayers sometimes ring out. And once again a question, an agonizing question that still faces me to this day. It arises from our life in images and meditations. I am afraid to respond to it myself, but I can no longer hold it inside me. Might someone convincing find an answer?</p><p>The prayer! This is Anastasia's prayer! Made up just of words. The words of a taiga hermit, uneducated, with a unique way of thinking and living. Mere words. But for some reason, each time they pulse anew through the veins in my writing arm, and the blood courses through them faster, measuring the seconds in which I must decide what is better and how to go on living. Ask the good Father to relieve me, give me, save me? Or like this, decisively and from the soul, the way she did, to state suddenly,</p><p>My Father, who is everywhere, I won't</p><p>Allow sin and weakness in myself,</p><p>I am Your son, I am for your delight.</p><p>I'll multiply your glory with my self.</p><p>Which prayer will He like more? What should I or all of us together do? What path should we follow?</p><p>My Father, who is everywhere, I won't</p><p>Allow sin and weakness in myself,</p><p>But where do I get the strength to say that and to live up to what I say?</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0412>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>12. Anastasia's Family Line</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>"Tell me, Anastasia, how did it happen that you and your forefathers have lived for millennia in the deep forest, separate from society? If, as you say, all humanity is a single organism and all have the same sources, then why is your family like a pariah among the others?"</p><p>"You're right, we all do have a single parent, as well as the parents we see. But each human destiny also has the freedom to choose a path according to his own will, leading to a specific goal. Along with everything else, this choice depends on the education of feelings."</p><p>"Then who educated your distant forefathers so that your family differs so much to this day? In its way of life, in its concept?"</p><p>"Back in those distant times . . . I said 'distant,' but it all might as well have been yesterday. Instead, I should say: when the time came and humanity did not create together but strove to dismantle God's creations, when the spear was already flying and the hides of betrayed beasts began to be considered a virtue on man's body, when the consciousness of everyone changed and chose the path leading to the present day, when human thought strove not for creation but knowledge—people suddenly began trying to sort out how, as a result of what, man, merging with woman, was capable of experiencing great satisfaction. Then, for the first time, men began taking women and women began giving themselves to men, not for the sake of creation, but for mutual satisfaction.</p><p>"They thought, as do people now, that such satisfaction comes every time there is a merging of the male and female principles, their flesh, their visible bodies.</p><p>"In fact, the satisfaction from the merging of only flesh is incomplete and fleeting. The other levels of the human 'I' do not take part in merely comforting actions. But man strove for a sense of fullness, changing bodies and ways of unifying, but to this day never achieving that.</p><p>"The sad consequences of those bodily pleasures were their children, who were deprived of conscious aspirations toward the goal of realizing the Divine dream. Women began giving birth in agony, and their children were doomed to live in agony. The absence of the three planes of being did not allow them to gain happiness, and so we have come down to the present.</p><p>"One of the first women to give birth to her child in agony saw that her newborn daughter had harmed her foot during the birth and was so feeble that she did not even emit a cry. That woman also saw that he who had enjoyed fleshly pleasure with her was indifferent toward the birth and had begun to seek pleasure with another woman. The new mother, who had conceived by accident, was filled with indignation at God. She grabbed her newborn daughter roughly and fled far from everyone, to thick, uninhabited forest. Stopping in despair to catch her breath, she wiped a tear from her cheeks and for good measure hurled words of spite at God: 'Why, in what You consider a beautiful world, is there pain, evil, renunciation? I experience no satisfaction when I look at the world You created. I am full of despair and burn with spite. Everyone has abandoned me. The one I caressed now shares caresses with another and has forgotten me. It was You who created them. He is Yours, he who betrayed me, was unfaithful to me. She who now caresses him is also Yours. They are your creations. And me? I want to strangle them. I burn with hatred for them. Your world has become joyless for me. What kind of fate have You chosen for me? Why was my child born ugly and half-dead? I don't want people to see it. This perception brings me no joy.'</p><p>"That woman did not lay her daughter down, she tossed the barely living bundle on the forest grass. She cried out with despair and spite, again addressing God.</p><p>"'Let no one see my daughter! But You, look. Look at the torment going on among Your creations. She is not going to live. I will not be able to feed the child I've borne. Hate curdles the milk in my breast. I'm leaving. But You, look! Look at how much imperfection there is in the world You created. Let birth die before You. Let it die among Your creations.'</p><p>"The mother ran away from her little girl in spite and despair. But the newborn girl, alone, a helpless bundle and barely breathing, was left alone in the forest grass. My distant foremother was in that little girl, Vladimir.</p><p>"God felt the despair and anger coming from Earth. He had sorrow and compassion for the sobbing, unhappy woman. But although He loved her, the invisible Father could not alter her fate. There was a crown of the freedom he had given her on the despairing woman. Each person builds his own destiny. The material plane is not subject to anyone. Only man alone is its full-fledged master.</p><p>"God is an individual. Father of all, He does not exist in the flesh, but the set of all the universal energies in him, the entire set of feelings inherent in man, does. He can rejoice or suffer and grieve when one of his sons or daughters chooses the path to suffering. He burns with fatherly tenderness toward all and each day caresses the entire Earth with the Sun's ray for everyone without exception. Every day, he does not lose hope that His daughters and His sons will follow the Divine path. Not on instruction, not under threat, but by exercising their freedom they will determine their own path toward joint creation, rebirth, and joy at its contemplation. Our Father believes, and He waits. Life goes on. The entire set of human feelings is in our Father.</p><p>"Could anyone imagine what God our Father felt when his newborn child was quietly dying in His forest, amid His creations?</p><p>"The little girl neither wept nor cried. Her little heart began beating more and more slowly. Only occasionally did her little lips seek the life-giving teats and try to drink.</p><p>"God does not have bodily hands. All-seeing, He could not press the little girl to his breast. Having given everything, what else could he give? And then, capable of filling the entire Universe with the energy of His dream, he contracted above the forest into a small mass. A small mass capable of scattering all the vast universal worlds by its swift expansion. It concentrated the energy of His love for all His creations over the forest. It was embodied through them in its earthly actions. And they . . .</p><p>"A rain drop touched the already blue lips of the little girl lying in the grass and immediately blew a warm breeze. Pollen fell from a tree and the little girl inhaled it. The day passed, night came, and the little girl did not die. The forest creatures, all the beasts, enveloped by Divine bliss, recognized the little girl as their own child.</p><p>"Years passed, and the little girl grew up and became a young woman. I can call her Lilith.</p><p>"When she stepped across the grass lit by the dawn, everything joyously shouted 'Lilith!' With her smile, Lilith lit up and caressed the world God had created around her. Lilith accepted everything around her the way we accept our own mother and father.</p><p>"When she was grown up, she walked up to the forest's edge more and more often. Quietly hiding among the grasses and bushes, she watched how people so like her lived their strange life. They were separating more and more from God's creations, building houses, smashing everything around them, and for some reason wearing the hides of wild animals. They took delight in killing God's creatures, and extolled those who killed the fastest. They kept trying to create from what was dead. Back then, Lilith did not know that by creating something dead out of something alive, they considered themselves smart.</p><p>"She wanted to go to the people to tell them what could bring joy for everyone. She desired joint creation and joy from contemplation of it. More and more the need grew in her to give birth to a new living Divine creation.</p><p>"She directed her gaze more and more often at one man. He seemed less pretentious, simpler than the others. He did not throw his spear far. Others regarded him as a failure as a killer. He was pensive and often sang softly, going off on his own, and often dreamed to himself.</p><p>"One day Lilith appeared to the people. Having gathered living forest gifts, she carried them in a basket woven of cane to the human crowd standing by a dead baby elephant, to the men arguing about something. He, her chosen one, was among them. When they saw her, they all fell silent. Lilith was beautiful. Not covering her bared figure, she did not know that fleshly desires had predominated over everything else in men. They rushed toward her in a crowd. Placing her gifts on the grass, she saw the eyes of those running toward her burn with desire, and he, her chosen one, ran after them all.</p><p>"Still at a distance, Lilith suddenly felt the fine strings of her soul touched by a wave of aggression. Taking a step back, she suddenly turned and ran from the approaching warrior men.</p><p>"Burning with lust, they chased her for a long time. She ran lightly and did not tire, but her pursuers were pouring sweat. They were not fated to touch Lilith. Those who lusted after the beautiful thing did not know that in order to know what is beautiful you must possess the same inside you.</p><p>"The warriors wearied of the chase. Losing sight of Lilith, they wandered back and got lost, although they eventually did find their way.</p><p>"Only one continued to roam the forest. Tired, he sat on a fallen tree and began to sing. Hiding quietly, Lilith observed and listened to the one she had inspired to sing, the one who had been chasing her with all the men. Nonetheless, she appeared before him at a distance, to show him the road to his encampment. He started off and did not run after her. When they reached the forest's edge, when he saw the fires and his encampment, forgetting everything, he headed off toward it at a run. Lilith watched him, her chosen one. First her heart beat unusually inside her, and then it suddenly quieted when Lilith asserted to herself and repeated: 'Be happy among the others, my beloved, be happy. How I would love to hear your happy song, not your sad song here, in my forest!'</p><p>"The runner suddenly halted and turned toward the forest in reverie. He glanced at the encampment, and once again aimed his gaze at the forest. Suddenly, he threw down his spear and began to stride confidently. He walked to where the hidden Lilith stood. When he passed her hiding place, Lilith watched, unable to tear her eyes away. The gaze of love may have stopped him. He turned and walked toward Lilith. He stood next to her, and she did not run away. Still shy, she lay her hand in his outstretched palm. Hand in hand, they started out, still not having spoken a word to each other. Walking toward the glade where Lilith grew up was a poet, my father, and my foremother.</p><p>"Years passed and the family line continued. Someone in each generation of my ancestors was overwhelmed by the aspiration to go where outsiders lived, so similar externally, but with a different fate. They went in various guises. Some hid among warriors or among priests, or aspired to become scholars. They shone as poets They tried to show another path to man's happiness, that next to us was He Who created everything, that one must not hide from Him to please the mercantile bustle rather than Him, that one must not bow to the other essences.</p><p>"They aspired to tell this story, and they perished. But even when one woman or man remained, with their love they found a friend among those outsiders. Thus, the family line continued, remaining faithful to the primary sources in their intentions and way of life."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0413>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>13. In Order to feel the Deeds of All People</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>"Anastasia, wait. A thought just struck me. You say that everyone perished, and that it's been going on like that for millennia. All attempts have been unsuccessful. All humanity has gone its own way?"</p><p>"Yes, all my foremothers' and forefathers' attempts have been unsuccessful."</p><p>"You mean they all perished, right?"</p><p>"All who went among people and tried to speak did perish."</p><p>"Then this means just one thing: you are going to perish like everyone else. You've started speaking, too, and hoping for another outcome here is simply foolish. Furthermore, if no one has been able to change the world and society's way of life, why do you—"</p><p>"Why speak of death prematurely, Vladimir? Look, here I am, still alive. You are beside me, and our son is growing up."</p><p>"But what is this confidence that has settled in you? What makes you believe it is you who will be victorious despite your ancestors' unsuccessful attempts? Like them, you are merely talking."</p><p>"You think I'm merely talking? Sometime you should think more carefully about my sentences. They are not for the mind. There is no information in them that has not been set forth before. Yet people read them, and they engender stormy feelings in many, all because they are so constructed that people understand a great deal between the lines. The poetry of their own soul fills in the gaps of what is unsaid. It is not me speaking now about the Divine truth but they themselves discovering it. Their numbers are growing so there is now no turning them away from the path of the dream intrinsic only to God. My mission is not yet complete, but the desire the Creator has been waiting for has been realized in many souls. That is the main thing.</p><p>"When the soul aspires to something in the dream, then believe me, everything must come to pass in life as well. It must."</p><p>"Then tell me why it all wasn't set forth in these kinds of sentences before."</p><p>"I don't know. Perhaps the Creator shone with a new energy, an energy that spoke in a new way about how every day we see around ourselves what we see, but do not lend it its proper significance. My feelings are not deceived. I feel it clearly. Once again he is accelerating all His energies. The dawn is coming for the whole Earth. His earthly daughters and sons will know the kind of life that the energy of the Divine dream created. Both you and I will be a part of that. But the main thing—the main thing is that they, the first ones, were able to sense those thoughts that formed between the lines, those thoughts which, like the music of the soul, were planted in people by the Creator's energies. It all worked out! It all came to pass! People are already striving to build a new world in their thoughts."</p><p>"You're speaking in too general a way, Anastasia. Speak more specifically. What should people do, and how and what kind of world should they build—a world where everyone will live happily?"</p><p>"I cannot speak more specifically right now, Vladimir. There have been many treatises in the life of humanity. People have sunk into worship before many of them, but they are all senseless. Treatises cannot change the world, and just one point serves as proof of this."</p><p>"What point? I don't understand."</p><p>"That point in the Universe where the limit to everything is set, that point at which all humanity now stands. It all depends on which direction they take next. All this speaks to the fact that there is no sense in treatises whatsoever. All humanity since creation has lived drawn only by its feelings."</p><p>"Wait, wait up. I what? . . . You mean I haven't done everything in my life by intellect?"</p><p>"Vladimir, like all other people, you have changed the correlation of matter around you with your mind, trying by material means to experience feelings, those feelings which each person knows intuitively, which each person seeks and cannot find."</p><p>"What feelings? What does each person seek? What are you talking about?"</p><p>"About what people back then, in the primary sources, felt when their life was still in paradise."</p><p>"So do you mean to say I've shoveled through so many matters with my mind in order to know the feelings of man in paradise?"</p><p>"Vladimir, think for yourself why you've done all the things you have."</p><p>"What do you mean why? Like everyone, I was providing for my life and family. I wanted to feel as good as other people."</p><p>"You said, 'to feel.'"</p><p>"Yes, I did."</p><p>"Now you'll be able to understand. 'To feel' . . . the deeds of all people."</p><p>"What do you mean by 'all'? Drug addicts search for those feelings, too?"</p><p>"Naturally. Like everyone, they strive to find these feelings by following their own path. By subjecting their earthly body to torture, by using a potion, in order for a moment, and only approximately to help them know the great feeling.</p><p>"Even a drunkard, forgetting everything, frowns and drinks his bitter poison only because the search for a beautiful feeling lives in him.</p><p>"The scientist strains his mind. He invents an intricate new mechanism and believes that the device will help him and everyone else know satisfaction. But in vain.</p><p>"Human thought has acquired quite a lot that is senseless in its history. Remember, Vladimir, you too are surrounded by many objects where you live, and each object is considered a scientific achievement. The labor of many people is spent on it happening. But just tell me, please, Vladimir, which of them has made you happy and satisfied with life?"</p><p>"Which one? Well, none taken individually maybe. But together all the objects still make life much easier. The car, for example. You sit behind the wheel and go where you want. It's raining and cold outside, but in the car you can turn on the heat. In a hot spell, everyone outside is soaked in sweat. You turn on the AC, and cool air surrounds you. In the house—in the kitchen, for example—there are lots of labor-saving devices for women: dishwashers and vacuum cleaners to make cleaning easier and to save time. It's clear to everyone that many devices can make life easier for us."</p><p>"Unfortunately, Vladimir, that ease is illusory. All humanity is forced to pay for them every day in shortened lives and suffering. To acquire soulless objects, people are forced to engage in work they do not love their entire life, like slaves. Soulless objects come to surround them, indicators of the degree to which man has failed to understand the universal essence of being.</p><p>"You are a human being! Look more closely around yourself. In order to obtain your next mechanical object, factories are built and belch a lethal stench, the water becomes lifeless, and you, a human being, must engage in joyless work your whole life to acquire devices you don't really need. They do not serve you. You serve them. You invent, repair, and worship them. Meanwhile, Vladimir, tell me, which of the great scholarly thinkers invented and at which factory did they produce this mechanism here for serving man?"</p><p>"Which one?"</p><p>"The squirrel with the nut under my hand."</p><p>I looked at Anastasia's hand. She was holding it outstretched, palm down, about half a meter above the grass. And on the grass, just under her palm, a red squirrel was standing on its hind legs. In its front paws the squirrel was holding a cedar cone. The red-brown face first leaned over toward the cone, then hoisted it up, and the squirrel's shiny round little eyes looked into Anastasia's face. Anastasia smiled as she looked at the little beast, not stirring, and kept her hand cantilevered. Suddenly, the squirrel put the cone on the grass, got very busy over it, and with its front paws and claws cracked the cone and took a little nut from it. It stood on its paws again, lifting its little face, as if it were extending the nut to Anastasia and asking her to take it from its paws. But Anastasia sat on the grass as before without stirring. The squirrel, tilting its little head, quickly bit though the nut's shell and with its little paws and claws shelled the seed and placed the nut seed on a blade of grass. Then it started getting more and more nuts out of the cedar cone, biting the shell, and piling the little nuts on a leaf. Anastasia lowered her hand and placed it on the grass palm up. And the squirrel quickly moved all the cleaned nuts from leaf to palm. With her other hand Anastasia lightly petted the fluffy little best, and the squirrel suddenly fell still. Then it ran up closer to Anastasia and stood up, peering into her face, as if quivering for joy before her.</p><p>"Thank you!" Anastasia said to the squirrel. "Today you are a beauty as never before. Go, go on, little fussbudget. Find yourself your chosen one, a handsome one worthy of you." She held her hand out toward the trunk of a spreading cedar. The squirrel ran around Anastasia twice, hopping, rushed headlong in the direction in which the person's hand had pointed, and jumping onto the trunk, disappeared in the cedar's crown. On the palm held out to me lay the cleaned cedar nuts.</p><p>"Really! Here is this mechanism," I thought. "It picks the food itself, brings it itself, and also shells it, a beast that needs no care, repair, or electricity."</p><p>After trying the nuts, I asked, "And the commanders—the Macedonian, Caesar, the rulers who started wars, Hitler, too—were they searching for the feelings of the primary sources as well?"</p><p>"Naturally. They wanted to feel like rulers of the whole Earth. They believed subconsciously that that feeling was akin to what everyone seeks intuitively. But they were wrong about that."</p><p>"You think they were wrong. Why do you think that? After all, no one yet has been able to conquer the whole world."</p><p>"But they have conquered cities and countries. A battle was fought for a city, and victories were achieved. But the winners gained transient satisfaction from that victory. They strove for greater conquest, and the wars continued. After conquering one country or many, they gained cares, not joy, and the fear of losing it all. Once again they sought satisfaction through military deeds. Their minds, polluted in the bustle, could no longer lead them to the dream of the great Divine feelings. All earthly military rulers have come to a sad end. The story known to everyone today speaks to this. Unfortunately, the bustle and casting about and the sequence of mercantile dogmas do not allow those living today to determine where, in what, the Divine feeling awaits them.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0414>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>14. Taiga Dinner</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Whenever I spent time with Anastasia in her taiga glade, I always took things to eat with me. I brought cans of food, cookies hermetically sealed in plastic, fish cut into pieces and vacuum sealed. Each time, returning from Anastasia's, I discovered all my stores unused, for each time she kept offering me treats. For the most part, these were nuts, fresh berries wrapped in leaves, and dried mushrooms.</p><p>We're used to eating mushrooms well cooked, roasted, marinated, or salted. Anastasia eats them dried, without any processing. At first I was afraid even to try them. But I did and they were fine. A piece of mushroom softens in the mouth from saliva, you can suck it like a candy, you can swallow it. I even got used to them. Once, I was traveling from Moscow to Gelendzhik for a readers' conference. All day I ate mushrooms Anastasia had given me. Solntsev, too, the director of the Moscow center, drove the car and ate those mushrooms. When I spoke at the conference, I suggested to those sitting in the hall that they try them, and people weren't frightened. Whoever wanted to took one of the mushrooms, ate it right up, and nothing bad happened to anyone.</p><p>In general, I can't remember an instance when I was Anastasia's guest that we sat down especially to eat. I tried what Anastasia offered as we walked, and I never once felt hungry. But this time . . .</p><p>I must have spent a long time contemplating the meaning of the prayer Anastasia uttered and so didn't notice that she had managed to set a big table, if I can put it that way.</p><p>On the grass, on various leaves big and small, lay the dishes. They took up more than a square meter. And it was all very handsomely set out and decorated. Cranberries, whortleberries, cloudberries, raspberries, black and red currants, dried strawberries, dried mushrooms, some kind of yellowish gruel, three little cucumbers, and two small red tomatoes. Lots of clusters of different herbs decorated with flower petals. There was a white liquid resembling milk in a small wooden bowl. There were flat cakes made out of I don't know what, and honey in combs sprinkled with different-colored grains of flower pollen.</p><p>"Sit down, Vladimir, try the daily bread God has sent," Anastasia proposed, smiling slyly.</p><p>"This is great!" I couldn't restrain my delight. "You don't say! You've served it all so handsomely, just like a good housewife for a holiday."</p><p>Anastasia was as pleased by the praise as a child. She burst into laughter, unable to take her eyes off her own meal, suddenly clapped her hands, and exclaimed, "Oh no, what kind of housewife am I? I forgot the spices. You like all kinds of sharp spices. You do, right?"</p><p>"I do."</p><p>"But the good housewife forgot about them. I'll be right back. I'll fix this."</p><p>She looked around, ran off slightly to one side, and picked something in the grass. Then in a different place, then among the bushes, she picked and soon placed among the cucumbers and tomatoes a little bundle assembled like a bouquet of different herbs, and she explained.</p><p>"These are spices. They're sharp. Try them if you like. Now there is everything. Try a little of everything, Vladimir."</p><p>I picked up a cucumber, surveyed the diversity of taiga food, and said, "Too bad there's no bread."</p><p>"There is bread," Anastasia replied. "Look here." She served me some kind of tuber. "This is burdock root. I prepared it so that it would replace tasty bread, potatoes, and carrots for you."</p><p>"I never heard of burdock root being used for food."</p><p>"Try it. Don't worry. People used to make all kinds of delicious and healthy dishes from it. First try it. I soaked it in milk. It softened."</p><p>I wanted to ask her where she got the milk, but when I tasted the cucumber . . . I didn't say anything until I had eaten the cucumber without bread. I took the burdock, the bread replacement, from Anastasia, but I didn't try it and just held it in my hand until I'd eaten that cucumber.</p><p>You understand, this ordinary-looking cucumber in fact tasted very different from those I'd eaten before. The taiga cucumber had a pleasant aroma unlike anything else. You probably know that cucumbers cultivated in greenhouses differ in their flavor and aroma from those grown in gardens in open soil. Those that grow in open soil taste and smell much better. Anastasia's cucumber was different, too—maybe even more different, for the better, than those I had eaten before from the garden. I quickly picked up a tomato and immediately ate the whole thing. Its taste was unusually pleasant, too. It, too, surpassed in taste all the tomatoes I had ever had occasion to eat. Neither the cucumber nor the tomato needed salt, sour cream, or oil. They were delicious just by themselves, like a raspberry, apple, or orange. No one is going to sweeten or salt an apple or pear.</p><p>"Where did you get these vegetables, Anastasia? Did you run to the village? What kind is this?"</p><p>"I grew them myself. You liked them, didn't you?" she asked.</p><p>"I did! This is the first time I've eaten ones like this. So you have a garden, a greenhouse? What do you use to dig up your garden, and where do you get fertilizer? In the village?"</p><p>"I just got seeds from a woman I know in the village. I chose a spot for them in the grass, and they grew. I planted the tomatoes in the fall and then hid them under the snow, and in the spring they began to grow. I planted the cucumbers in spring, and they managed to ripen, the little ones."</p><p>"But why are they so delicious. Is it a new sort?"</p><p>"It's the ordinary sort. They're different from garden ones because when they were growing they got everything they needed. In garden conditions, when they try to fence plants off from touching other species, when their growth is sped up by fertilizers, they cannot take in everything they need and become self-sufficient, so that man will like them."</p><p>"Where did you get the milk, and what are the flat cakes made of? I thought you didn't eat animal products, and here the milk . . ."</p><p>"This isn't milk from animals, Vladimir. The milk before you comes from the cedar."</p><p>"What do you mean the cedar? A tree can really give milk?"</p><p>"It can, only far from every kind of tree. The cedar can, for example. Try it. This drink has a lot in it. The cedar milk before you can nourish more than the flesh. Don't drink it all at once. Try a few sips. Otherwise you won't want to eat anything else. That alone will fill you up."</p><p>I drank three sips. The milk was thick, with a pleasant, slightly sweet taste. Also, there was a warmth coming from it, but not like the kind from warmed cow's milk—an incomprehensible, gentle warmth touched everything inside me and seemed to alter my mood.</p><p>"This cedar milk is delicious, Anastasia. Quite delicious! How do you 'milk' a cedar to get this?"</p><p>"You don't. You have to grind and grind the milky kernels with a special stick in a wooden mortar, calmly, thoughtfully, and in a good mood. Add living water, spring water, little by little, and that's how you get milk."</p><p>"You mean people never knew about this?"</p><p>"Many people used to know. Even now, people in taiga villages sometimes drink cedar milk. In the cities, people prefer completely different food, less nutritious but easier to preserve, ship, and prepare."</p><p>"You're right about all that. In the cities everything has to be done fast. But this milk . . . what a great tree the cedar is! The same cedar can give nuts, and oil, and flour for cakes, and milk."</p><p>"And the cedar can give much else that is unusual, too."</p><p>"What that's unusual, for example?"</p><p>"You can make the most marvelous perfume from its volatile oil. Self-sufficient and healing perfume. Nothing artificial can surpass its fragrance. The cedar's volatiles represent the spirit of the Universe. They can heal the flesh and can serve as a barrier against what is harmful to man."</p><p>"Can you tell me how to obtain that perfume from the cedar?"</p><p>"I can, of course, but you must eat a little more, Vladimir."</p><p>I reached for a tomato, but Anastasia stopped me.</p><p>"Wait a minute, Vladimir. Don't eat that way."</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"I prepared all sorts of different things for you so that you could first try everything, so it can heal you."</p><p>"It?"</p><p>"When you try some of everything, your organism takes for itself what it needs. You will want to eat more of what it selects. Your organism itself determines what it lacks."</p><p>"For the first time," I thought, "she has betrayed her own principles."</p><p>The point is that Anastasia had healed me twice, when I'd had certain pains inside. I don't know exactly what kind, but strong pains in my stomach, liver, and kidneys, maybe in all of them at once. The pains were so strong that painkillers didn't always help. But I knew that when I went to see Anastasia, she would heal me. This works quickly with her. However, the third time, she refused to treat me. She didn't even relieve the pain fully with her gaze and stated that since I was not changing my way of life and not eliminating what was facilitating the disease, then she couldn't treat me, since in this case treatment could only do harm. At the time, I was so angry at her that I never repeated my request for treatment.</p><p>
When I returned, I did, however, start smoking a little less and limiting my alcohol. I even fasted for a few days. I felt better. At the time, I thought that we don't have to go to the doctor or healer every time. We can take ourselves in hand when we're gripped by pains. It would be better, of course, if we weren't. I couldn't heal myself completely, but I also decided not to ask Anastasia for help, and she herself, you see, agreed.</p><p>"You said you weren't going to treat me anymore or even take away the pain."</p><p>"I'm not going to take away your pain any more. Pain is God's conversation with man.</p><p>"But what I'm doing now is all right. After all, I'm offering you food, and this does not conflict with your nature, but with theirs."</p><p>"Theirs?"</p><p>"Those who are creating this harmful program for man."</p><p>"What harmful program? What are you talking about?"</p><p>"About the fact that you, Vladimir, like the majority of people, are eating according to an established routine, a very harmful routine."</p><p>"Perhaps some people eat according to some regimen. There are all kinds of different ones—for losing or gaining weight. But I eat however I want. I haven't even read a single diet book. I go to the store and choose what I myself like."</p><p>"That's right. You go to the store and choose, but you choose strictly from what the store offers."</p><p>"Well, yes. . . . Everything in the store now is conveniently bundled and packaged. Competition is great because it leads everyone to please the customer and do everything for the customer's convenience."</p><p>"Do you think it is all done for the customer's convenience?"</p><p>"Yes. Who else?"</p><p>"All technocratic systems always work for themselves alone, Vladimir. Is it really for your convenience to get frozen or canned food and half-killed water? Has your organism really determined the assortment of foods in the store?</p><p>"The technocratic world took up the role of providing you with what is vitally essential. You agreed to this, you trusted it entirely, and you even stopped giving it any thought as to whether you needed everything it offered you."</p><p>"But we're alive. We're not dying from these stores."</p><p>"Of course you're still alive. But the pain! Where does your pain come from? Think. Where is most people's pain from? Disease and pain are unnatural for man; they are the consequence of an unsound path. Right now, you will be convinced of this yourself. Before you lies just a small part of what Divine nature has created for man. Try a little bit of everything and take along what you like. Three days is enough for the little herbs you yourself choose to vanquish your pains."</p><p>I tried a little of everything while Anastasia was talking. Some of the bunches of herbs did not taste good; others, on the contrary, I wanted to eat more of. Then, before I left, Anastasia put what I had liked at dinner into my pack. This is what I ate for three days. The pain completely passed.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0415>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>15. Can They Change the World?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>"How is it, Anastasia, that when you talk about your forefathers, you always talk more about the mothers, the women? Almost nothing about the men, your fathers, as if your fathers were insignificant in your family. Or do you, your genetic code, or your ray keep you from seeing and sensing your paternal forefathers? I even feel insulted for these men, your fathers."</p><p>"I can sense and see the actions of my fathers who lived in the past as well as my mothers if I want. But I am far from being able to understand all of my fathers' actions and determine their significance for the present day, for all people, and for myself."</p><p>"Tell me about just one of your fathers whose actions you can't completely understand. You're a woman. It's harder for you to understand men. It'll be easier for me. I'm a man. If I do understand, I'll be able to help you understand."</p><p>"Yes, yes, of course. I'll tell you about the father of mine who was able to learn how to produce living substances more powerful than all the weapons of the present day and future. Nothing manmade can withstand them. They are capable of changing the earthly world, destroying galaxies, or creating other worlds."</p><p>"Great! Where is this thingamajig now?"</p><p>"Each earthly person is capable of producing it if he understands and feels. My father gave some of the secret to the Egyptian priests. Even today, earthly rulers govern their states according to the scheme, the mechanism, of those priests. The purpose and process of governing is understood less and less. This mechanism has been degraded, not perfected, over the centuries."</p><p>"Wait, wait. In your opinion, then, today's presidents govern countries according to the scheme or order of Egypt's ancient priests?"</p><p>"Since then, no one has brought anything substantive to the scheme of governance. Today, earthly states are unaware of the mechanism for governing the community of people."</p><p>"It's just that it's hard to be convinced of this. Try to tell the whole story in order."</p><p>"I will, and you try to understand."</p><p> </p><p>Tens of thousands of years ago, when the world did not yet know the greatness of Egypt, when no such state had yet existed, human society split into many tribes. A family—my forefather and foremother—lived apart from human society, according to their own laws. Everything surrounded them in their glade, as in the primary sources, as in paradise. My foremother was a beauty, and she had two suns. One shone, rousing everything to life with the ray of the sunrise; the second was her chosen one.</p><p>She always rose first, bathed in the river, warmed herself with the light of sunrise, and herself gave everyone the light of joy and waited. She waited for him, her beloved, to awaken. He would wake up, and she would catch his first glance. When their eyes met, everything around them fell still. Admiringly, the space took in their love and awe, their bliss and delight.</p><p>The day passed in joyous care for things. My father always watched thoughtfully as the sun dropped before sunset, and then he sang.</p><p>She listened to his singing with secret delight. Back then, my foremother did not understand how words woven into song created a new, unusual image. She wanted to hear about it more and more often, and as if sensing my foremother's wish, my father sang each time, drawing unusual images that became more and more vivid. Invisibly, the image came to live among them.</p><p>Awakening one morning, my forefather did not meet the gaze of love as usual, but he was not surprised. He rose calmly and began to walk through the forest. He saw my quieted foremother in a secluded spot.</p><p>She was standing alone, leaning against a cedar. My father took her, quiet, by the shoulders. She did not raise her moistened gaze to him. His fingers lightly touched the teardrop running down her cheek, and he gently said, "I know. You are thinking about him, my beloved. You are thinking about him. This is not your fault. The image you have created is invisible to me. Invisible, but more beloved by you than I am. This is not your fault, my beloved. I am leaving. Now I will join people. I have come to know how beautiful images are created. I will tell people about this. What I know, others will be able to learn, and the beautiful images will bring people to the primordial garden. There is nothing more powerful in the Universe than the substances of living images. Even your love for me could be vanquished by an image I create. Now I will be able to create great images, and the images will serve people."</p><p>My foremother's shoulders shuddered, and her trembling voice whispered, "What for? You, my beloved, have created the image I love. It is invisible. But the visible you is leaving me. Your child is already stirring inside me. What will I tell him about his father?"</p><p>"Beautiful images will create a world that is beautiful. Our growing son will picture his father's image. If I am worthy of the image pictured by my son, I will be able to become it, and my son will know me. If I am unworthy of his picture, I will stay away, so as not to hinder his aspiration for what is beautiful, his dream."</p><p>Not understood by my foremother, he left. He went to join people. He went with his great discovery. He went for all his future sons and daughters, with the aspiration of creating a beautiful world for all.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0416>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>16.

</div></p><p> </p><p>In those times, the tribes living on Earth were fighting among themselves. Each strove to raise more warriors, and among the warriors, those who aspired to farming and poetry were considered ordinary. Each tribe had priests, who tried to frighten people, but they did not have a clear goal. Frightening others served as consolation for them. Each gratified his own self-esteem by saying that he had received something greater than everyone else from God.</p><p>My forefather was able to assemble the poets from several tribes, the priests. In all, there were nineteen of them, eleven singer-poets, seven priests, and my forefather. They gathered in a secluded and uninhabited place.</p><p>The singers sat modestly; the priests ensconced themselves separately, pompously.</p><p>My forefather said to them, "The enmity and wars among tribes can be stopped. The peoples will live in unity. In this state, the leader will be fair, and each family will be rid of the calamities of war. People will begin to help one another. The community of men will find the way to the primordial garden."</p><p>But the priests ridiculed my father at first. "Who would want to relinquish his power to someone else voluntarily? To collect all the tribes into one, someone has to be the most powerful and vanquish the others, but you want there not to be any war. Your words are naïve. Why have you summoned us, you slow-witted wanderer?" The priests prepared to leave. My father stopped them with these words.</p><p>"You are wise men, and we need your wisdom in order to create laws for human society. I can give each of you such power that no weapon created by human hand could withstand it. When you use it for good, for the goal, for the truth, for a happy sunrise, it will come to help everyone. When he who possesses it meanly desires to use it to conquer and subjugate, he himself will perish."</p><p>The prospect of unusual power stopped the priests. The eldest priest suggested the following to my father.</p><p>"If you know of some unusual power, tell us about it. If it is effective and capable of building states, you will remain among us to live in that state. Together we will create laws for human society."</p><p>"This is why I came to you, to tell you about the unusual power," my father replied to them all. "But before I do, I ask you to name a ruler out of all those you know—one who is good and not greedy, who lives in love with his family and does not think of war."</p><p>An old priest answered my father that there was one ruler who avoided all battles. But his tribe was small. They did not strive to glorify their warriors, and for that reason few in it even aspired to become warriors. To avoid battles, they often had to change their encampment and live as nomads, to let others have the places fit for life and themselves settle in places undesirable. This leader's name was Egypt.</p><p>"The state will be called Egypt," my father said. "I will sing you three songs. Singer-poets, sing these songs to people in your different tribes. Priests, settle among the people of Egypt. Families will come to you from different places. Greet them with your good laws."</p><p>My father sang the three songs to those gathered. In one, he created the image of a just ruler, calling him Egypt. Another was the image of a community of happy people living together. The third depicted a loving family, the happy children in it, the fathers and mothers, all living in their unusual state.</p><p>The three songs used ordinary words familiar to all. But from them, phrases were constructed so that those listening with bated breath heeded them. Also, the melody resounded through my father's voice. It summoned, beckoned, captivated, and created living images.</p><p>The Egyptian state did not yet exist in reality, its temples had yet to be built, but my father knew that it all would appear as a result of what man's thought and dream, merging into one, summoned them to. He sang inspiredly, knowing the unusual power that our great Creator had given for each one. My father sang, possessing the power that differentiates man from everything, that gives him authority over everything, that allows man to be called the son of God and a creator.</p><p>Singer-poets, burning with inspiration, sang these three songs in their different tribes. The beautiful images drew people, and people came to Egypt from various places.</p><p>Five years later, the Egyptian state emerged from this small tribe. All the other tribes, once considered more important than the others, simply fell apart. Their bellicose rulers could do nothing against this disintegration. Their authority weakened and vanished. Something had vanquished them, but it was not war.</p><p>Accustomed to fighting in matter, they did not know that images were powerful over all—those images to the human soul's liking, those images that draw hearts.</p><p>Troops armed with spears or any other weapon are powerless before an image, even just one, but a sincere one, unclouded by the mercantile postulate. They are overthrown. Troops are powerless against an image.</p><p>The Egyptian state grew strong and large. Priests called its ruler pharaoh. Priests secluded themselves in temples, away from human bustle, and created laws, and the ruler-pharaoh was obliged to follow them. Each ordinary inhabitant eagerly carried them out, and each strove to make his life the equal of the image.</p><p>My father lived in the main temple, among the high priests. For nineteen years, the priests heeded him. They tried to learn the highest of all sciences, how great images are created. My father sincerely tried to tell them everything, burning with good intention. The priests learned the entire science, or part of it. At any rate, now it is unclear, and it makes no sense to try to clarify it.</p><p>One day, nineteen years later, the high priest gathered the priests closest to him. They solemnly entered the main temple, to which even the pharaoh did not have access.</p><p>The high priest sat on the throne, above all the others. My smiling father sat among the priests. He became lost inside himself, in reverie, creating another song, drawing a new image in it or, perhaps, fortifying an old one.</p><p>The high priest said to those gathered, "We have learned a great science. It will allow us to rule the whole world, but in order for our power to be eternal over all, not even a particle of knowledge may be allowed to pass outside these walls. We must create our own language, and we will communicate in it to one another, so that none of us can let the secret out even by accident.</p><p>"Through the ages we will send many treatises in different languages to the people. Let them all be amazed and think we are setting all this forth. We will set forth many wondrous sciences and different discoveries, so that the common people and rulers move further and further away from the main thing. In coming ages, let the wise men amaze with their wise treatises and other sciences. In so doing, while moving away from the main thing ourselves, we will lead others further from the main thing as well.</p><p>"So be it," all the others agreed with the high priest. My father alone was silent.</p><p>The high priest continued.</p><p>"There is one other question we must decide without delay. In nineteen years of study, we have learned how images are created. Any one of us now is capable of creating an image that could change the world, destroy or strengthen a state—and still the mystery remains. Can any of you tell me why the image each creates is different and why we create like this for so long over time?"</p><p>The priests were silent. No one knew the answer. The high priest continued, raising his voice slightly. The staff in his hand shook from tension, when he said to everyone, "Meanwhile, among us, one is capable of creating images swiftly, and their power remains unsurpassed. He has been teaching us all for nineteen years, but something remains unsaid. All of us must understand that we are not equal among ourselves. The rank each of us possesses does not matter. Let each know that among us one can rule invisibly over all, secretly. He is at liberty by the power of the image he can create to exalt or kill each one. One is capable of deciding the fate of states. I, the high priest, with the power given me, can change the balance of powers. The doors of the temple in which we are now sitting are closed. Outside, my loyal guard will not open the door to anyone without my say."</p><p>The high priest rose from the throne, and stepping slowly and pounding his staff over the stone slabs, started toward my father. Suddenly he stopped in the middle of the hall and looking at my father said, "Now you will choose one of two paths. Here is the first. Right now you will reveal to all the secret of the power of your images. You will tell us how and with what they are created, and you will be declared second priest after me and become the first when I leave. All those living will bow down before you. But if you do not reveal to us your secret, a second path will be presented to you. It leads only to this door."</p><p>The priest pointed to the door leading from the temple sanctuary to a tower that had neither windows nor other outside doors. This tall tower with smooth walls had a platform on top and from it, once a year, on a specific day, my father or some other priest sang before the gathered people.</p><p>The high priest, pointing out the door to my father, added, "If you go through this door, you will never come out of it. I will give orders to seal the door, except for a small window, through which you will receive minimal food every day. When the time comes and people gather by the tower, you will go out to them on the high platform. You will go out, only you will not sing, creating images. You will go out so that the people see you and they are not troubled and so that false rumors do not arise due to your disappearance. You may only greet the people in words. If you dare sing a creating song, even one, you will not receive food or water for three days. For two, six days no food or water will you receive, and you will be choosing your own death. Decide which of the two paths you yourself will choose."</p><p>My father rose calmly from his seat. His face held neither fear nor reproach, merely a sadness that lay there lightly, like crow's feet. He passed down the row of sitting priests and looked into the eyes of each one. In each pair of eyes, he saw the thirst for knowledge. There was a thirst for knowledge but also greed in each pair of eyes. My father walked right up to the high priest and looked into his eyes.</p><p>The gray-haired priest did not turn his stern eyes, burning with greed, away but struck his staff, and repeated into my father's face, spraying spittle, "Decide quickly which of the two paths to the future you choose."</p><p>Without fear in his voice, my father answered him calmly.</p><p>"By the will of fate, perhaps, I choose one and a half paths."</p><p>"How can you choose one and a half?" the priest shouted. "You dare mock me and everyone who is in the great temple now!"</p><p>My father walked to the door leading to the tower, turned, and answered, "Believe me, I had no thought to laugh at you and cause insult. By your will, I go to the tower forever. Before leaving, I will reveal the secret to everyone as best I can, and I know my answer will not bring me the second path. This is why it turns out that I have chosen one and a half paths."</p><p>"Then speak! Do not delay!" the voices were heard of the priests, who had jumped up from their seats under the vaults. "Where is the secret?"</p><p>"It is in the egg," came the calm reply.</p><p>"The egg? What egg? What are you talking about? Explain yourself." those gathered questioned my father, and he gave those gathered his answer.</p><p>"The egg from a chicken grows into a chicken. The egg from a duck grows into a duck. The egg from an eagle brings the world an eagle. Whatever you feel yourself to be, that is what will be born of you."</p><p>"Feel it? I am a creator!" the high priest suddenly cried out. "Tell us, how does one create the most powerful image of all?"</p><p>"You did not tell the truth," my father replied to the priest. "You yourself do not believe what you are saying."</p><p>"How do you know how much strength there is in my belief?"</p><p>"A creator would never ask for an answer. A creator is capable of supplying it himself. You are asking, and this means you are in the shell of unbelief."</p><p>My father left, the door shut behind him, and they sealed the entrance, following the high priest's order. Once a day, they put food through the small opening for my father. The food was meager, and they did not always give him enough water. For three days, before the people were supposed to gather in front of the tower to hear the new songs and tales, they did not give my father any food, they gave him only water. So ordered the high priest, having changed his original order. He ordered this so my father would weaken and not sing a new creating song to those gathered.</p><p>When many people had gathered before the tower, my father came out on the tower's platform to the people. He looked gaily at the waiting crowd. He did not say a word to people about his own fate. He simply began to sing. The song poured out in a voice of rejoicing, and an unusual image was shaped. The people gathered there heeded him. My father completed his song and immediately began a new one.</p><p>The singer standing above sang for a whole day. As sunset neared, he told everyone. "With the new dawn, you will hear new songs." For a second day, my father sang to the gathering. The people did not know that the singer, living in his dungeon, was no longer being given water by the priests.</p><p> </p><p>Listening to Anastasia's story about her distant forefather, I felt like hearing at least one of the songs he sang, so I asked.</p><p>"Anastasia, if you can produce entire scenes from the life of your forefathers in such detail, then does this mean you might sing a song your forefather sang to the people from the tower?"</p><p>"I myself hear all these songs, but an authentic translation of them is impossible. We lack many words. Also, many words now have a different meaning. In addition, the rhythm of the poetry heard then is hard to create in present-day language.</p><p>"That's too bad. I would like to hear those songs."</p><p>"Vladimir, you will. They will be resurrected."</p><p>"What do you mean resurrected? You're always saying translation is impossible."</p><p>"Authentic translation is impossible. But new ones can be created that are the same in spirit and meaning. Bards are creating them right now, using words familiar to all today. One, the last one my father sang then, you have already heard."</p><p>"I have? Where? When?"</p><p>"The bard from Yegorievsk sent it to you."</p><p>"He's sent a lot."</p><p>"Yes, he has, and among them one very much resembles that last one."</p><p>"How could such a thing have happened?"</p><p>"There is a continuity among times."</p><p>"What kind of song is this? What words are in it?"</p><p>"You'll understand very soon. I will tell you everything in order."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0417>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>17. When the Fathers Understand</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>On the third day, at dawn, my father climbed to the platform once more. He smiled and looked at the crowd of people. He was searching in the crowd for someone. Wandering singers waved to him in greeting and lifted their instruments up, and the strings of their instruments vibrated in the hands of the inspired singers. My father smiled at them and scanned the crowd more and more closely. My father wanted to see his son. To see his son, borne by his beloved nineteen years before in the forest. Suddenly from the crowd came a young, ringing voice.</p><p>"Tell us, great poet and singer. You stand on top, high over all. I am here below, but why does it seem to me that you are close to me, as if you were my father?"</p><p>And all the people heard the dialog between the two.</p><p>"What is this, youth? You do not know your own father?" the singer asked from the high tower.</p><p>"I am nineteen years old, and I have never once seen my father. My mother and I live alone in the forest. My father left us before my appearance."</p><p>"Tell me, youth, first, how do you see the world around you?"</p><p>"The world is beautiful at day's dawning and sun's setting. It is marvelous and multiform. But people are spoiling its beauty and inflicting suffering on one another."</p><p>From the high tower, the voice responded.</p><p>"Perhaps your father left you because he felt ashamed for the world he brought you into. Your father left in order to make the world beautiful for you."</p><p>"So did my father believe he could change the world alone?"</p><p>"The day will come when all fathers understand that it is they who must answer for the world in which their children live. The day will come when each will understand that before bringing a beloved child into the world, the world must be made happy. You, too, must think about the world in which your offspring will live. Tell me, youth, how soon will your chosen one give birth?"</p><p>"I do not have a chosen one in the forest. The world there is beautiful, and I have many friends. But I have not met the one who would want to follow me into my world, and I cannot leave it."</p><p>"Well then, you may not yet have seen your beautiful chosen one. On the other hand, you have time to make the world at least a little more joyful for your future child."</p><p>"That is what I strive for, as did my father."</p><p>"You are no longer a youth. You have the blood of a fine young man flowing in you, a future poet and singer. Tell people about your beautiful world. Let's you and I sing together. Let us sing about the future beautiful world."</p><p>"Who can sing when your voice is heard, great poet and singer?"</p><p>"Believe me, youth, and you too will be able to sing. I will do the first line, you the second. Only sing boldly, poet."</p><p>My father began to sing from the high tower. Over the heads of the gathered people, a soaring voice chimed in like an echo, exulting, and drew out a line:</p><p>When I arise, the smiling dawn is all around.</p><p>And from the crowd below, suddenly a clear, ringing voice continued, still shyly:</p><p>And as I walk, the birds all sing . . .</p><p>The son's line followed the father's. Sometimes the voices merged into one, and a ringing song of joy was heard:</p><p>This day will never end. My love for you</p><p>Grows ever stronger.</p><p>The now emboldened youth continued the song with desperate ecstasy:</p><p>Stepping lightly down the road of the Sun,</p><p>I come into my Father's grove, I see</p><p>The shining path but do not feel my feet.</p><p>There is no end to joy like this.</p><p>I remember seeing all of this:</p><p>Sky and trees and flowers. My gaze was other,</p><p>All in longing and offense, and now —</p><p>Now You, O God, inhabit all!</p><p>Though all remains, the stars and birds,</p><p>Yet now I look upon them differently:</p><p>I know not sorrow, no more anger.</p><p>Oh world and all its people, I love you all!</p><p>The singer on the tower sang more and more softly, and soon the voice from the tower fell silent. The singer on the tower swayed, but he kept his feet and smiled at the people. He listened to the end, as his son's voice grew ever stronger! His son the singer stood below.</p><p>When the song was finished, the father standing on the tower's platform waved to the people in farewell. In order to hide away from people's eyes, he descended five stairs. Growing weaker, losing consciousness, he strained his hearing to its limit. He heard, a breeze brought the words that a young beauty had ardently whispered to his son, the young singer: "Allow me, youth, allow me . . . I will follow you, I will enter your beautiful world."</p><p>On the stone steps of the sealed tower, his father lost consciousness and died with a smile. With his last breath, his lips whispered: "Continue our line. Be happy in a circle of happy children, my beloved." My foremother's heart heard his words. Then the words of the songs of my two fathers were repeated by poets over the millennia. The words and phrases of that song were spontaneously reborn in the poets of various countries and times. They were heard in many languages. The simple words bore the truth, broke through postulates. Today, we hear them again. Whoever decodes these lines—not with his mind, but with his heart—will gain much wisdom.</p><p>"But in the other songs your father sang from the tower, was there some purpose? Why did he give his life for the songs?"</p><p>"Vladimir, in his songs my father created many images. They later built and preserved the state for a long time. Priests, descendents of those first priests, created many religions with their help and seized power in different countries. There was only one thing the priests did not know when they used images for venal purpose. The priests did not know how to make the images serve them forever, eternally. Images from those who aspired to subordinate them to their own pride lost their power. Who . . ."</p><p>"Wait, Anastasia. There's something I just can't understand about the images."</p><p>"Forgive me, Vladimir, for the incomprehensibility of my explanations. I will try to relax now and get ready to tell you, in order, all about the science that is chief among all the sciences. It is called the science of imageness. All the ancient and modern sciences stem from it. Its priests dismembered it to conceal the main thing forever, to preserve forever their power over everything earthly, and they transmitted their knowledge of it orally to their descendants in underground temples. They strove so hard to preserve their secret that only a thousandth part of that science has been passed down to their descendants, today's priests. But at the time it all began, the priesthood did much better."</p><p>"And how did it all start? Tell me everything from the beginning."</p><p>"Yes! Yes, of course. For some reason I became overexcited again. I must tell you everything in order. Comprehension of that science began with the tower of the ringing songs."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0418>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>18. He Glorified the Joy of Life</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>When my father sang from the high tower, his songs gave birth to images. Among the people standing below were poets, singers, and musicians. All the priests of those days sat sedately among the many people standing. More than anything, the priests were afraid of an image being born in the song that would expose them—that my father would tell about being shut up in the tower by the priests. But he sang only of the joyous from his sealed tower. He created the image of a just ruler and a people with whom he could live happily. He created images of wise priests and drew a flourishing country and the people who lived there. He did not expose anyone; he glorified the joy of life.</p><p>The priests who had been learning the science of imageness for nineteen years probably understood better than the others what the singer was doing. They followed people's faces and saw inspiration light up those faces. They followed the way the poet's lips whispered the lines and the way the musicians quietly strummed their instruments in time with the songs.</p><p>For two days, my father sang from the high tower. In their minds, the priests calculated how many thousands of years one man was building a future before all. On the third day, with the dawn, all heard the words of the final song, which the son sang with the father. He absented himself, and the people dispersed.</p><p>The high priest remained in his place for a long time. He sat in reverie, and he saw the priests standing about in silence. Then, before their eyes, the hair and brows of the high priest turned white, and theirs was covered in gray. He rose and ordered the entrance leading to the tower unsealed. And the entrance leading to the tower was unsealed.</p><p>On the stone floor, the poet's body lay lifeless. There was a piece of bread about two meters away; his weakened hand had not reached that far. A mouse kept darting between the hand and that piece of bread and squeaking. The mouse kept asking and waiting for the poet to pick up his bread and share it with him, but the mouse itself would not take the bread. It waited, hoping for the singer to revive. The mouse saw the people entering and skittered toward the wall, then toward the feet of the silent priests, and ran up to them. The mouse's two burning, beady eyes tried to look into the human eyes. The entering priests did not notice it on the gray slabs. Then he ran up again hurriedly to the little piece of bread. The little gray mouse squeaked desperately, took a little piece of bread, and pushed it toward the hand of the lifeless philosopher, poet, and singer.</p><p>My father's body was buried by the priests with great honor in the underground temple. They hid his grave from all, under a stone slab in the floor. Over my father's body, bowing his gray head, the high priest said, "None of us can say of himself that he learned, as you did, how great images are created. But you have not died. We have only buried your body. All around the images you created will live above the Earth for millennia, and you are in them. Our descendants' souls will touch them. Perhaps someone in future centuries will be able to learn the essence of creation and how people should be. We must create a great teaching, and in secret we will preserve it for millennia, until one of us or our descendants discovers that toward which man should direct his great power."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0419>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>19. The Secret Science</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>"The priests created a secret science. Their teaching was called the science of imageness, and all the other sciences derived from it. The high priests, in order to keep the main thing secret, dismembered the science of imageness and made the other priests think along various lines. Thus, astronomy, mathematics, and physics were born later, as well as many of the other sciences, including the occult ones. Everything was structured in this way merely to fascinate people with its parts, so that no one would penetrate to the main teaching."</p><p>"What is this main teaching, though? What is this science of what you call imageness, and what is its essence?"</p><p>"This science allows man to speed up his thoughts and think in images, to grasp the entire cosmos at once and penetrate to a microworld, to create invisible but living image-substances and control them with the help of the great community of people. With the help of this science, many religions came about. He who came to know it only slightly possessed incredible power and could subdue countries and topple kings from their throne."</p><p>"So you mean a single person alone could subdue a country?"</p><p>"Yes, he could, and the scheme in this is simple."</p><p>"Is even one such fact known to present-day history?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Tell me about it. I don't seem to remember anything of the kind."</p><p>"Why waste time telling you? When you get back, read about Rama, Krishna, and Moses. You will see the creation of these priests, who learned a part of the secret science of imageness."</p><p>"All right, I will read about what they did, but will I understand the essence of the science? Try to tell me about the essence, what they studied and how."</p><p>"They studied how to think in images. I've told you about that."</p><p>"Yes, you have, only I don't understand what the connection is, well, between mathematics or physics and this science."</p><p>"Whoever has mastered this science does not need to write formulas, to draft and create various models. Instead, he can penetrate to the matter with his thoughts, to the nucleus, and split the atom. But this is merely a simple exercise, in order to understand how to govern human destinies and the peoples of various countries."</p><p>"Well that's just great. I've never read that anywhere."</p><p>"And in the Bible? The Old Testament gives an example of when the priests vied among themselves over who created more powerfully in images. The priest Moses and the pharaoh were the highest priests. Moses threw his staff down in front of everyone and turned it into a snake, and the priests who were with the pharaoh did the same thing. Then the snake Moses created swallowed the other snakes."</p><p>"So all that was the truth?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"I thought it was a fiction or some kind of allegory."</p><p>"Not a fiction, Vladimir. Everything was exactly as the Old Testament says about that competition."</p><p>"But why did they need to compete that way with each other?"</p><p>"In order to show who could create a powerful image capable of vanquishing the others. And Moses showed them all that he was the strongest. After that, it made no sense for them to fight him. They needed to carry out his request, not fight. But the pharaoh did not obey, and he tried to stop the Israelites following the leadership of Moses and the image he had created. But the warriors could not stop the nation of Israel, the nation in which the most powerful image resided. Then you can read how the people of Israel vanquished other tribes many times and captured cities and how they created their religion and state. The pharaohs' glory dimmed. But when the priests of Egypt were the most powerful of all in the creation of great images, when they could calculate which actions the created image would produce among the people, Egypt, governed by priests, flourished.</p><p>"Of all the states we know that were created after the last catastrophe on Earth, Egypt prospered longest of all."</p><p>"No, wait a minute, Anastasia. Everyone knows that Egypt was governed by the pharaohs. Their pyramid-tombs have survived to our day."</p><p>"The role of executive power lay outwardly on the pharaohs, but the pharaoh's main task was to embody the image of a wise ruler. The important decisions were not drawn up by the pharaoh. When the pharaohs attempted to take the fullness of power for themselves, their state immediately weakened. Each pharaoh was first of all dedicated to the kingdom by the priests. Beginning in infancy, he studied with the priests and strove to learn the science of images. Anyone who mastered the basics of it could be appointed to a kingdom.</p><p>"The structure of power in Egypt at the time can be described like this today. The secret priests stood at the very top. Then came the priests who engaged in study and administered justice. Control over the state was performed outwardly by a council of representatives of the estates of all the priests, and the pharaoh ruled according to their laws and decrees. Community leaders had quite a bit of executive power and were considered independent. Everything was more or less as it is today. Many states have a president and a government as the executive power. The parliament, like the priests from the past, issues laws. The only difference is that in no country is there anywhere for the president to learn the way the pharaoh learned from the priests. For those who preside in a council, duma, or congress—the terms used for today's legislator-priests make no real difference—something else does matter: they, too, have nowhere to learn before issuing a law. Where are legislators to learn wisdom when the science of imageness is kept secret? This is why there is chaos in so many states."</p><p>"Do you mean to say, Anastasia, that if we took as a basis a structure for governing the country like there was in ancient Egypt, everything would be better?"</p><p>"The structure of power would change little. Much more important is what stands behind it. If we're speaking of the Egyptian structure, then neither it, nor the pharaohs, nor even the priests of Egypt governed."</p><p>"So who did?"</p><p>"Images governed everything in ancient Egypt. The priests and the pharaohs deferred to them. From the ancient science of imageness, a secret council of a few priests took the image of the pharaoh, the just ruler. They took the image as it presented itself to them at the time. The pharaoh's conduct, outward attire, and way of life were long discussed in that secret council. Then they taught one of the chosen priests, so that he resembled the image. They tried to select a pretender out of the royal estates. But if no one of royal blood was suitable in appearance or personality, the priests could choose any priest and present him as the pharaoh. The priest-pharaoh was obliged before everyone to always correspond to the conceived image, especially when he appeared among the people. Afterward among the people, each person felt the invisible image above himself and acted as he understood. When the people believe in the image, when an image is to the majority's liking, each person will be eager to follow it, and the state will have no need to build a huge bureaucracy of overseer-officials. A state like that will grow stronger and flourish."</p><p>"But if that were so, then states today could not get along without images. But they do, and they prosper. America, Germany. Even our Soviet Union, before perestroika, was a huge state."</p><p>"Without an image, Vladimir, states cannot get along even today. Today only that state can flourish relative to others if an image rules that is more or less acceptable to most people."</p><p>"So who is creating it today? There are no priests today."</p><p>"There are priests today, too, only we do not call them that, and they have less and less knowledge of the science of imageness. Modern priests cannot make long-term and impartial calculations. They cannot set a goal and create a worthy image capable of leading the country toward that goal."</p><p>"What are you talking about, Anastasia? What priests and images were there in our Soviet Union? The Bolsheviks governed everything then. First Lenin and then Stalin stood at the head, and then the other first secretaries. They had a Politburo. Religion then was nearly eliminated altogether. Temples were destroyed, and you say 'priests.'"</p><p>"Vladimir, look more closely. What came before the Soviet Union arose?"</p><p>"What do you mean what? Everyone knows. The tsars. Then there was a revolution, and we followed the path of socialism and tried to build communism."</p><p>"But before the revolution, an image spread intensively among the people of a just, happy, and new arrangement for the state, and the old arrangement was exposed. You see, first the image of a new state was conceived, as well as the image of a new ruler, kinder than all, among the people and of a way each person would live happily. It is these images that led people, summoned them to fight those still loyal to the old images. The revolution and then the Civil War, into which so many people were drawn, in fact were wars between the two images."</p><p>"There may be something to this, of course, but Lenin and Stalin weren't images. Everyone knows they were just men, the country's leaders."</p><p>"You name names believing that only people in the flesh stood behind them. In fact . . . Perhaps you should think about this yourself and realize that all this is far from correct, Vladimir."</p><p>"Far from correct? I'm telling you. Everyone knows that Stalin was a human being."</p><p>"Then tell me, Vladimir, what kind of human being was Stalin?"</p><p>"What kind? What kind . . . Well, at first everyone thought he was good and just. He loved children. They showed him in photographs and pictures carrying his little girl. During the war, many soldiers went into battle shouting, 'For the Homeland, for Stalin.' Everyone wept when he died. My mother told me that when he died, nearly the entire population of the country wept. They laid him to rest in the Mausoleum next to Lenin."</p><p>"So, you mean that many loved him and with his name were victorious in their mortal combat with their enemies? Poems were written to him, but what do people say about him now?"</p><p>"Now we think him a tyrant, murderer, and bloodsucker. He sent many people to rot in prisons. His body was taken out of the Mausoleum and buried in the ground. All his monuments were destroyed, and the books he once wrote. . . ."</p><p>"Now do you yourself understand? Two images have arisen before you. Two images, but there was only one person."</p><p>"Yes, one."</p><p>"What was he like? Can you tell me now?"</p><p>"Probably not. . . . Can you yourself tell me?"</p><p>"Stalin did not correspond to either the first or the second image, and therein lay the country's tragedy. Tragedies have always come about in states with significant discrepancies between the ruler and his image. All the troubles have begun from this. In such times, people fought over images. Quite recently, people aspired to the image of communism, but the image of communism weakened. Now what do you and your fellow citizens aspire to?"</p><p>"Now we're building. . . . Well, maybe capitalism, or something else, but so that we can live the way people do in developed countries like America and Germany—so that we have democracy and plenty of everything, like they do there."</p><p>"Now you have identified the image of the country and the just ruler in it based on the image of the countries you have named."</p><p>"Yes, let's say the image of those countries."</p><p>"But this speaks to the fact that the knowledge of the priests in your country is scant. There is no knowledge. Those who are worthy of creating the image and capable of following this path do not have the power. Usually in this kind of situation, all states have perished; history has proclaimed this for millennia."</p><p>"But what is bad about us all beginning to live as people do in, say, America or Germany?"</p><p>"Vladimir, take a closer look yourself at how many problems there in the countries you named. Why do they need so many police and hospitals? Why are there more and more suicides? Where do these people go to vacation from the rich and large cities of those countries? They need to appoint a growing number of officials to monitor society. All this speaks to the fact that the images are weakening among them."</p><p>"So does this mean we are aspiring to their weakening images?"</p><p>"Yes, it does. In this way, we are extending their life briefly. When the leading images were destroyed in your country, a new image was not created in it, and everyone was lured by an image that resides in another country. If all people worship it, then your country—a country that is losing its own image—will cease to exist."</p><p>"But who is capable of creating it today? There are no priests today."</p><p>"There are people today, too, who do nothing but create images. They calculate the images' ability to attract people and often their calculations are correct."</p><p>"I don't seem to have even heard about them. Or is all this being kept in strictest secret?"</p><p>"Like many people, you come into contact with their actions every day."</p><p>"Where and when?"</p><p>"Vladimir, remember, when the time comes for you to choose new deputies in the government, or a single ruler—what's called a president now—several hopefuls present their images to all. Each image is shaped by the people who have chosen for themselves the profession of creating images. Different candidates have several such people, and the candidate whose image pleases the majority the most, wins."</p><p>"What image? They are all real, living human beings. They themselves speak to voters at gatherings, and they themselves appear on television."</p><p>"Of course they do, but they are always advised where and how to behave and what to say so that they correspond to an image pleasing to many. Often, candidates follow the advice. Advertisements made for them, too, try to link their image to a better life for everyone."</p><p>"Yes, they do advertise. Still, I don't quite understand what's more important, the person himself who wants to be elected deputy or president, or the image you keep talking about?"</p><p>"Of course, the human being is always more important, but after all, when you vote, you have not met him. You do not know exactly what he is like, and you vote for the image offered to you."</p><p>"But each of the candidates has a policy program, after all, and people vote for the program."</p><p>"How often are those programs carried out?"</p><p>"They're not always carried out, but they could never be carried out in full because others block the way with their programs."</p><p>"This is how it happens all the time. Many images are created, but there is not full unity among them. There is no unified image capable of attracting everyone and leading them to the goal. There is no image, which means there is no inspiration, the path is unclear, and life is minute-to-minute, chaotic."</p><p>"Who can create that image? There are no wise priests today. I'm hearing from you for the first time about the science of imageness that your forefather taught the priests."</p><p>"Wait a little and the country will have a powerful image. It will vanquish all wars, and human dreams of a beautiful reality will come to pass in your country and then all over the Earth.</p><p>

Genetic Code</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Anastasia spoke with passion, first joyfully, then despondently, of what had once been on Earth. Some of it I believed, some not really. Upon my return, I felt like finding out about how man retains information in his memory about events not only from the moment of his birth but from the moment of his ancestors' birth and even the moment of the first person's creation. Specialists and scientists in this gathered several times in conferences, and here I will quote excerpts from individual statements by specialists at one roundtable on this issue.</p><p>"For many, the assertion that ordinary objects retain information about a person might seem unusual. But if you show a cassette with a recording to someone who has never seen a tape recorder or heard of its possibilities, and you say that your voice is recorded on this cassette, that he can listen to your voice when he wants, a year or ten years later, this person will not believe you. He will think of you as a trickster. For us, though, the fact of recording and reproducing a voice is an ordinary phenomenon. I mean that something that seems unusual to us might seem quite simple and natural to others."</p><p>"If we take as a foundation the fact that man has yet to invent anything more substantive and perfect than what has been invented by nature, then Anastasia's ray, by which she can see at great distances, is confirmed by the existence of the cordless telephone and television. Moreover, as I see it, those natural phenomena which she uses are a more perfect realization of the artificial things we invent, like the cordless telephone and television."</p><p>"The memory of one person can barely retain events from six months ago. Another person can remember events from his childhood and can tell about them. But this does not seem to me anywhere near the ultimate limit to human memory."</p><p>"I do not think many scientists would deny that man's genetic code has been preserving primordial information inside itself for millions of years. The collection of additional, so-called auxiliary information is also possible during a lifetime, as well as its transmission to subsequent generations. Expressions we all know—'it's hereditary' and 'it's inherited'—in fact attest to this. Anastasia's abilities to reproduce human scenes that occurred millions or billions of years ago are theoretically possible and explicable. Moreover, they could be even more precise, the more distant they are from our reality. I think that Anastasia's memory is no different from the memory of many people. It would be more accurate to say that the information laid down in her genetic code is no greater than in every other person. The difference is that she possesses the ability to access it, to reproduce it in full, whereas we do so partially."</p><p class=section>* * *</p><p>These and other statements by specialists somehow convinced me that Anastasia could be speaking the truth about the past. I especially liked the example of the tape recording. However, the scientists invited to the roundtable could still not explain the following phenomenon. How could Anastasia possess information about not only the life of earthly civilizations, but also the life of civilizations in other worlds and galaxies? Not only that, she could not only speak about them, but, it seemed to me, influence them. I will try to talk about it all in order. Perhaps someone, even if only theoretically, will be able to explain these abilities of hers and understand whether they are inherent in other people or not. Anastasia herself tried to explain how she knows about them, but I could not always understand her explanations completely.</p><p>In general, I will try discuss the following situation in proper order.</p>

Where Do We Go when we Sleep?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br></div> </p><p>A few times in Anastasia's story about earthly civilizations, I heard her mention the existence of life in other galaxies of the Universe and on other planets. This piqued my interest so much that, listening to her story about humanity's past, all I could think was, "What about there, on other planets? How is life arranged?"</p><p>Anastasia must have seen my attention cool for her story, and she fell silent. So did I, because I was thinking about how to get her to tell me more, and more specifically, about the life of extraterrestrial civilizations. I could have asked her outright, of course, but she always gets so distraught when she can't explain why she knows something others don't. Also, her desire not to stand out among others because of her unusual abilities prevents her, I think, from saying everything. I began to notice that she was embarrassed by her inability to explain the mechanism of certain phenomena.</p><p>This is what happened once when I asked her directly, "Tell me, Anastasia, can you teleport yourself in space? You know, move your body from one place to another?"</p><p>"Why are you asking me about this, Vladimir?"</p><p>"First answer me concretely. Can you or not?"</p><p>"Vladimir, all people have that ability. But I am not certain I can explain to you how natural this process is. You will withdraw from me again and consider me a sorceress. You won't like being with me."</p><p>"You mean you can?"</p><p>"Yes, I can," Anastasia replied, slowing, and she looked down.</p><p>"Then demonstrate, show me how this happens."</p><p>"Maybe first I should try explaining—"</p><p>"No, Anastasia, first show me. It's always more interesting to watch than to listen. Afterward you can explain."</p><p>Anastasia stood up, resigned, and closed her eyes. She tensed a little and vanished. Puzzled, I looked from side to side. I even felt the spot where she had just been. But there was only crushed grass in that spot, and Anastasia was gone. I saw her standing on the opposite shore of the lake. I looked at her and was silent.</p><p>She shouted, "Should I swim to you or again—"</p><p>"Again," I replied and, without blinking, so as not to miss anything, began watching the figure of Anastasia standing on the other shore of the small lake. Suddenly, she vanished. Dissolved. There wasn't even a haze in the spot where she had been. I kept watching without blinking.</p><p>"I'm here, Vladimir," Anastasia's voice rang out beside me. Once again she was standing a meter away. I moved away from her slightly and sat down on the grass, trying not to show amazement or agitation. For some reason, I thought, "What if she got it into her head to dissolve my body and not reassemble it?"</p><p>"A body can be fully dissolved and its atoms split only by its owner. This is available only to the person, Vladimir," Anastasia spoke first.</p><p>It was clear to me that now her top priority would be to prove that she was a human being, and so, not to waste her time, I said, "Of course, a human being. But not any human being, after all."</p><p>"No, not every one. He must . . ."</p><p>"I know what you're going to say: 'He must have pure intentions.'"</p><p>"Yes. Intentions and also think quickly and in images, picture in detail and specifically his own body and desire, his strong will, his belief in himself. . . ."</p><p>"Don't try to explain, Anastasia. Don't try for nothing. Tell me instead, can you transfer your body anywhere?"</p><p>"Anywhere, but I do that very rarely. To anywhere is very dangerous, and there is no need of that. Why transfer your body? You can do it a different way."</p><p>"Why dangerous?"</p><p>"You need to picture very precisely the spot where you want to transfer your body."</p><p>"If you didn't, what would happen?"</p><p>"It could perish."</p><p>"From what?"</p><p>"For instance, say you want to move your body to the bottom of the ocean, and you do, but the water pressure crushes it, or you drown. You might land on a road in a city in front of a moving car and be struck and crippled."</p><p>"Can a person move his body to another planet, too?"</p><p>"Distance plays absolutely no role whatsoever here. It will move wherever your thought specifies. First, the thought turns up in the desired place. It shapes and collects the body that has been dissolved in space."</p><p>"But to dissolve your own body, what do you have to think about?"</p><p>"You have to picture all its matter, down to the tiniest atom, down to the nucleus, and see how in the nucleus particles create outwardly chaotic movement, and dissolve them in space through your thoughts. Then you gather them in their former sequence, the outwardly chaotic movement in the nucleus. Moreover, you must reproduce it exactly. It's all very simple. Like children's building blocks."</p><p>"But can it happen that the other planet does not have the appropriate atmosphere for breathing?"</p><p>"That is what I'm saying. It is dangerous to move without thinking it through. You need to anticipate a great deal."</p><p>"So it wouldn't work to another planet?"</p><p>"It would. You can move some of your surrounding atmosphere, too, and the body will live in that for a while. But it is better in general not to move your body without a special need to do so. In most cases, it's enough to look at a distance with the ray or to move just your second, immaterial self."</p><p>"Incredible! It's hard to believe that each person used to be able to do this."</p><p>"Why 'used to'? Now, too, the second human self can move about freely, and it does. But people do not set themselves any objectives. They do not define goals."</p><p>"For whom, for which people, when does it move?"</p><p>"Right now this happens mainly when the person is asleep. The same thing can be created during waking hours, too, but due to the daily bustle and all kinds of dogmas and artificial problems, people are losing their ability to govern themselves more and more and to think strongly enough in images."</p><p>"Maybe because it's not interesting to travel without a body?"</p><p>"Why do you think that? The final result for sensations is often one and the same."</p><p>"If the result were identical, people wouldn't drag their bodies around traveling through different countries. The tourist business is a very profitable one for us now. Furthermore, I don't quite understand the part about a person's second self. If the body wasn't in a certain place, that means the person wasn't either. This is all simple and clear."</p><p>"Don't rush to hasty conclusions, Vladimir. I will cite three different situations right now. Try to determine which of the three involved an actual person on the journey."</p><p>"I will try. Go on."</p><p>"First, imagine yourself or someone else soundly asleep. He is placed on a stretcher. The sleeping person is put on a plane and transported to a city in another country—for example, from Moscow to Jerusalem. There the sleeper is carried down the main street and into a temple. Then they take the sleeper back by the same route and lay him down where he had been. What do you think, was the Muscovite in Jerusalem?"</p><p>"First tell me about the other two."</p><p>"Fine. Another went to Jerusalem himself, walked down the main street, spent a little time in a temple, and returned."</p><p>"And the third?"</p><p>"He left his body at home. But he possessed the ability to picture it all at a distance. As if in a dream, he strolled through the city. He was in the temple and stopped in somewhere else, then he also returned in his thoughts to his former affairs. Of the three, who do you think was in Jerusalem?"</p><p>"Only one of the three was really there. That was the man who went there himself on a trip and saw everything himself."</p><p>"So be it, but what did the visit ultimately give each of them?"</p><p>"For the first, nothing. The second could recount what he had seen. And the third . . . The third could also recount it probably, only the third could be wrong because he would be recounting what he had seen in his sleep, and dream and reality can diverge sharply."</p><p>"But dreaming as a phenomenon is also reality."</p><p>"Well, yes, the dream exists as a phenomenon. Say it is reality, too. But why bring this up?"</p><p>"Because you are probably going to deny that man has always been capable of uniting or joining two existing realities."</p><p>"I know where you're taking this. You mean to say that you can take command of your dream and direct it where you want."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"But how can such a thing happen?"</p><p>"With the help of the energy of thought, its ability to liberate any reality to penetrate images."</p><p>"You mean that it will record everything in the other country, like a movie camera?"</p><p>"Excellent. Let the movie camera serve as a primitive confirmation of this. Does this mean that you have concluded, Vladimir, it is not always necessary for material bodies to move around in order to sense what is happening in a distant land?"</p><p>"Maybe not always. But why have you started telling me about this? To prove something?"</p><p>"I realized when you started talking about other worlds that you would demand or ask me to show them to you. I want to carry out your request without subjecting your body to risk."</p><p>"You understand everything correctly, Anastasia. I truly did want to ask you that. Does this mean there really is life on other planets? Ooh, how interesting to take a look at them!"</p><p>"Which planet do you want to choose for your excursion?"</p><p>"You mean there are a lot that are inhabited?"</p><p>"Yes, but there is none more interesting than Earth."</p><p>"Still, what kind of life is on the others, and how did it arise?"</p><p>"When the Earth appeared as a Divine creation, the many universal essences burned with the desire to repeat the marvelous creation. They wanted to create their own in other worlds, using the planets they felt were suitable. They did, but no one was able to create a life in a harmony similar to earthly harmony. There is a planet in the Universe where ants dominate over everything. There are a great many on it. These ants eat other forms of life. When they have nothing to eat, they start eating themselves and perish. The essence that created this life tries to repeat his creation again, but never comes up with anything better. No one has been able to unite all that exists in harmony.</p><p>"There are also planets where essences have tried and are trying right now to create a vegetative world similar to Earth. And they are creating this. Trees, grass, and bushes grow on those planets. But their creations die each time they achieve full maturity. None of the universal essences has been able to guess the secret of reproduction. They are like man today. After all, man today has himself created much that is artificial. But none of his creations can repeat themselves. They break, rot, wear out, and require constant care. A large part of the Earth's people have been transformed into slaves of their own creations. Only God's creations are capable of recreating themselves and living in harmony through great diversity."</p><p>"Anastasia, are there planets in the Universe where beings, like man, understand technology?"</p><p>"Yes, there are, Vladimir. That planet is six times bigger than Earth. On it are beings that resemble man. Their technology is artificial and much less perfect than earthly technology. Life on that planet was created by a universal essence that considers itself akin to God and strives for superiority over God's creatures."</p><p>"Tell me, are they the ones who fly to earth in saucers, their spaceships?"</p><p>"Yes. They have tried to contact earthly people more than once. But their contacts for Earth . . ."</p><p>"No, wait a minute. Could you somehow take me, my second self, to that planet for a while?"</p><p>"Yes. I could."</p><p>"Then do it."</p><p>Anastasia went on to ask me to lie on the grass, relax, and spread my arms out to the sides. She placed one of her palms on mine and after a while I was plunged into something resembling a dream. I say "something" because this falling asleep was unusual. First, my body relaxed more and more. It grew numb, but I could see and hear everything around me beautifully—birds singing, leaves rustling—and then I closed my eyes and plunged into a dream, or "detached," as Anastasia says. To this day, I do not understand what happened to me after that. If we assume I fell asleep with Anastasia's help and dreamed a dream, then it cannot be compared with an ordinary human dream for the fullness of my sensations and the clarity with which I saw everything.</p><p>

 </p><p><div class=chapter id=0422> *********************** *********************** ***********************</br><h2>22. Other Worlds</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br></div></p><p> </p><p>I saw another world, another planet. I've remembered everything that went on there clearly and in detail, and at the same time in my consciousness there remains the sense that such a thing cannot be seen. Imagine, your mind and consciousness tell you that such a thing cannot be seen, but the visions and scenes remain inside you. I will try to describe them for you.</p><p>I was standing on ground like earth. There was absolutely no vegetation around me. I say "standing," but whether I should put it that way is hard to say. I didn't have legs or arms, or a body, for that matter, and at the same time it seemed as though I could feel the stoniness and unevenness of the surface through the soles of my feet.</p><p>Around me, as far as the eye could see, rose machines, egg-shaped and squared off, like a cube. I say "machines," because the one closest to me was rumbling lightly. Tubes of many different sizes led from the machines into the ground. Some tubes shook slightly, as if something were being sucked out of the ground through them, and some were still. There were no living beings whatsoever in the vicinity. All of a sudden, I saw the blinds separate on the side of a strange mechanism and a kind of disc floated out slowly. It resembled the ones athletes throw, only bigger. The disk was approximately forty-five meters in diameter. It hovered in the air and rotated. It descended a little, then flew up and rushed over me without making any sound whatsoever. The other mechanisms standing farther away were doing the same thing, and a few more disks flew over me, one after the other, following the first. Then, again, emptiness—just the rumble and shudder of the strange mechanisms. The scene piqued my interest, but its lifelessness frightened me more.</p><p>"You have nothing to fear, Vladimir." Suddenly I heard Anastasia's voice and cheered up.</p><p>"Where are you, Anastasia?" I asked.</p><p>"Next to you. We are invisible, Vladimir. Our feelings, sensations, intellect, and all our other invisible energies are present here right now. Here we are present without our material bodies. No one can do anything to us. The only thing you have to fear is yourself and the consequences of your own feelings."</p><p>"What kinds of consequences could there be?"</p><p>"Psychological ones—like losing your mind temporarily."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Yes, only temporarily, for a month or two, the vision of other planets sometimes disturbs man's mind and consciousness. But don't be afraid. This does not threaten you. You will withstand it. Here, too, don't be afraid of anything. Believe me, understand me, Vladimir, right now you are here but you do not exist for them. Right now we are invisible and impenetrable."</p><p>"I’m not afraid. Why don't you tell me, Anastasia, what these rumbling machines all around are. What are they for?"</p><p>"Each of these egg-shaped machines is a factory. They produce the flying saucers that interest you so much."</p><p>"But who services and runs these factories?"</p><p>"No one. They were programmed from the outset to produce a specific ware. Through the tubes, which go deep down, they suck out whatever raw materials they need in the required amount. Smelting, stamping, and then assembly take place in small chambers and a fully finished product goes out. This kind of factory is much more rational than any earthly one. There is virtually no waste from its operation. There is no need to transport raw materials from distant places, no need to haul separate details to the assembly point. The entire manufacturing process occurs in one place."</p><p>"Stunning! If only we had something like this! But who pilots the new flying saucer? I saw them all flying in one direction."</p><p>"No one pilots it. It flies to the warehousing facility itself."</p><p>"Incredible! Just like a living being."</p><p>"Actually, there is nothing incredible about it, even for earthly technologies. After all, Earth also has pilotless planes and missiles."</p><p>"Nevertheless, people still guide them from Earth."</p><p>"Earth has long had missiles that are preprogrammed for a specific purpose. All you have to do is press the launch button, and the missile itself starts up and flies to a determined goal."</p><p>"Maybe it does. And really, why should I be so amazed at this?"</p><p>"If you think about it, there is not a lot that can amaze you. There is significant progress here only in comparison with earthly technologies. These factories are multifunctional, Vladimir. They can produce a great many things, from foodstuffs to powerful weapons."</p><p>"How do they make foodstuffs? Nothing grows here."</p><p>"Everything is underground. When necessary, the machine sucks the requisite juices from underground through its tubes and presses them into granules. These granules contain all the substances necessary for keeping the flesh alive."</p><p>"What does this thing itself feed on? Who provides electricity for it? I don't see any wires."</p><p>"It makes its own energy, using everything around it."</p><p>"Just look, how smart! Smarter than man."</p><p>"Not at all smarter than man. It's just a machine. It obeys the program given it. It is very easy to reprogram. Do you want me to show you how it's done?"</p><p>"Show me."</p><p>"Let's move a little closer to it."</p><p>We were standing a meter away from the butt end of a huge mechanism the size of a nine-story building. I could hear its crackling more distinctly. Many tubes, as flexible as tentacles, extended from it and went underground and were moving around. The surface on the butt end was not entirely smooth. I saw a circle approximately a meter in diameter thickly covered with tiny, filament-like wires. Each moved individually.</p><p>"This is the antenna of the scanning instrument. It catches the brain's energy impulses, which are used to compile programs capable of carrying out any assignment received. If your brain models some kind of thing, the machine will have to manufacture it."</p><p>"Anything?"</p><p>"Anything you can picture in detail. It's like building with your thoughts."</p><p>"And any automobile?"</p><p>"Naturally."</p><p>"Can I try it right now?"</p><p>"Yes. Move closer to the receiver and first force it mentally to turn all its antenna's filaments toward you. As soon as that happens, start picturing what you desire."</p><p>I was standing next to the antenna filaments and, burning with curiosity, I mentally desired that all its filaments listen to me. First they turned in my direction and then all of them, trembling faintly, sent their tips toward my invisible head and fell still. Now I had to picture some kind of thing. For some reason I started picturing a Zhiguli, model 7—the automobile I had in Novosibirsk. I tried to picture everything in detail: the windshield and hood, the bumper, the color, even the license plate. Well, in general, I spent a long time picturing it all. When I got tired of it I moved away from the antenna. The enormous machine started rumbling harder.</p><p>"You're going to have to wait," Anastasia explained. "Now it will dismantle the incomplete product and compile a program to carry out your idea."</p><p>"Will I have to wait long?"</p><p>"Not long, I don't think."</p><p>We walked up to the other machines. As I examined the multicolored stones underfoot, Anastasia's said, "I think the product you thought up is finished. Let's go see how well it carried out your assignment."</p><p>We moved toward the familiar machine and started waiting. After a little while, its blinds opened and a Zhiguli slid down a smooth ramp onto the ground. But this monster standing before me was very far from the beauty of the earthly automobile. First, it only had one door, the one on the driver's side. Instead of a back seat, there were reels of wire and pieces of rubber. I walked, or moved, around the item standing there. You couldn't call it an automobile.</p><p>On the passenger side, it was missing two wheels. There was no front license plate or bumper. The hood apparently didn't open; it looked as if it was of a piece with the chassis. In general, this unique factory had produced not an automobile but some kind of goblin of indeterminate purpose.</p><p>"Some job it did!" I said. "It looks like an extraterrestrial enterprise. For something like that on earth, they'd fire all the designers and engineers."</p><p>Anastasia burst into laughter and then her voice informed me, "Of course, they would. But after all, the main designer in this case is you, Vladimir, and you see the fruit of your design."</p><p>"I wanted a regular modern automobile, and what did it spit out?"</p><p>"Wanting isn't enough. You have to picture everything in the tiniest detail. Your imagination didn't even think of passenger doors. You just thought about the one door for yourself. You pictured only the wheels on your side. You were too lazy to put wheels on the other side. I don't think you even thought about an engine."</p><p>"No, I didn't."</p><p>"That means your construction doesn't have an engine inside. So why are you angry at the manufacturer, if you yourself gave him such an incomplete program?"</p><p>All of a sudden I saw or felt three flying apparatuses approach us. "We should beat it," the thought flashed, but Anastasia's voice reassured me.</p><p>"They won't notice or sense us, Vladimir. They've received information about an interruption in the plant's operation and now they've probably come to inspect. We can calmly observe the living inhabitants of this planet."</p><p>Out of the three small flying apparatuses came five extraterrestrials. . . . They looked a lot like earthly people. Not just like them, but everything about them was like earth people. They were well formed. No stooping, their athletic bodies held their handsome heads straight and proud. They had hair on their heads and eyebrows on their face and one had a neatly trimmed mustache. They wore thin, multicolored, tight-fitting coveralls.</p><p>The extraterrestrials walked up to the automobile their factory had made, or rather, to the semblance of an earthly automobile. They stood beside it and looked at it in silence, without emotion. "They're probably examining it," I thought.</p><p>The youngest of the extraterrestrials standing there, a dark blond, walked up to the car door and tried to open it. The door wouldn't. The lock must have stuck. His further actions were quite earthly, which made me like them very much. The dark blond slapped the door in the area of the lock, gave one harder tug on the handle, and the door opened. He sat in the driver's seat, put his hands on the wheel, and began carefully examining the instruments on the dashboard.</p><p>"Good job," I thought. "He's smart." Confirming my conclusion, I heard Anastasia's voice.</p><p>"This is a very prominent scientist, by their standards, Vladimir. His mind works quickly and rationally in the technical area. He also studies the life of other planets, including Earth. Even his name resembles an earthly one: Arkaan."</p><p>"But why doesn't he seem surprised that the factory produced the wrong thing?"</p><p>"Feelings and emotions are almost entirely lacking among inhabitants of this planet. Their mind works rationally and evenly and is not subject to emotional outbursts or divergences from a set goal."</p><p>The dark blond climbed out of the car and made noises like a telegraph clicking out Morse code. An elderly extraterrestrial stepped out from the group and stood by the filament antenna where I had stood earlier. Then they all got into their flying apparatuses and disappeared.</p><p>The factory that produced the automobile according to my design began to rumble again. Its tube-tentacles pulled out from underground and headed in the direction of the nearest automatic-factory, from which tube-tentacles were also stretching.</p><p>When all the tentacles connected, Anastasia said, "See, they have issued the self-destruct program. All the details of the factory that had the interruption will be melted down by the other factory and used in production."</p><p>I felt a little sorry for the robot-factory with which I had so unsuccessfully created an earthly automobile. But there was nothing to be done here.</p><p>"Vladimir, do you want to look at the daily life of this planet's inhabitants?" Anastasia offered.</p><p>"Yes. Of course."</p><p>We found ourselves above one of the big planet's cities or settlements. The view from above offered the following picture.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, this entire settlement consisted of lots of cylindrical structures resembling modern skyscrapers. They were placed in many circles. At the center of each circle were lower structures reminiscent of earthly trees. Many of their radar-leaves were even green. According to Anastasia, the artificial constructions collected from below ground the components of substances essential for feeding the organism, which were subsequently sent through special pipelines to the housing of each planet inhabitant. The structures in the center of the circles also supported the essential atmosphere on the planet.</p><p>When Anastasia suggested spending time in one of the apartments, I asked, "Could we go to the apartment of that dark blond extraterrestrial who got into my car?"</p><p>"Yes," she replied. "He is just about to come home from work right now."</p><p>We found ourselves nearly at the very top of one of the cylindrical skyscrapers. There were no windows in the extraterrestrial building. The round walls were painted in squares of muted colors. At the bottom of each square was a door that lifted, like in a modern garage. From time to time, a small flying apparatus like those made by the robot-factories would fly out of the aperture that opened in the lower part of the square and fly off. It turned out that, under each apartment in the tall building, there was a small garage for the apparatus.</p><p>There were no elevators or doors in the building. Each apartment had a separate entrance straight from the garage, and, as became clear later, each inhabitant of this planet who had reached a certain age lived in this kind of apartment.</p><p>At first, I didn't like the apartment itself very much. When we followed the dark blond extraterrestrial into his apartment, its poverty and bareness amazed me. The room of about thirty square meters was completely empty. Not only did it not have any windows or partitions, it didn't have any furniture either. The smooth, light-colored walls did not have a single shelf or picture for decoration.</p><p>"Did he just get this apartment?" I asked Anastasia.</p><p>"Arkaan has been living here for twenty years. His apartment has everything he needs for rest, entertainment, and work. Everything essential is built into the walls. You're about to see for yourself."</p><p>Indeed, as soon as Arkaan walked up from his sub-apartment garage, the room's ceiling and walls began to glow softly. Arkaan turned to face the wall next to the entrance, placed his palm on the surface, and made a sound. A square in the wall lit up.</p><p>Anastasia provided a running commentary of events in the apartment. "Right now, the computer is identifying the apartment's owner based on the lines in his hand and the pattern of his eye. Now it will greet him and tell him how long he has been absent and of the need to audit his physical condition. You see, Vladimir, Arkaan has put his other hand on the console and taken a deep breath so that the computer can check his health. The audit is over and a report has appeared on the screen about what nutritive mixture he needs to take. The computer is also asking what Arkaan intends to do for the next three hours.</p><p>"The computer needs to know this in order to prepare the appropriate mixture. Now Arkaan is asking for a mixture that can maximally activate his intellectual activities for the next three hours, and after that he intends to go to sleep.</p><p>"The computer does not recommend that he engage in active intellectual activity for three hours and suggests that he take a compound calculated to support active work for two hours and sixteen minutes. Arkaan has agreed with the computer's recommendation.</p><p>"A small niche has opened in the wall where Arkaan has taken a flexible tube by the handle and brought its tip to his mouth. He's drunk and eaten from the tube and walked over to the opposite wall. The niche with the tube has closed, the screen square has gone out, and the wall where the extraterrestrial was just standing is once again smooth and a single color."</p><p>I thought, "With that kind of technology there's no more need of a kitchen and all its equipment, dishes, furniture, and even cleanup. Nor is there any need for a wife who cooks well. You don't have to go to the store. The computer audits your health at the same time it prepares the food you need and gives out all kinds of recommendations. I wonder how much a computer like that would cost if it were manufactured on Earth."</p><p>At this, Anastasia's voice informed me, "As for costs, it is cheaper to equip each apartment with this kind of setup than to load up a kitchen with furniture and all the food preparation equipment. They are much more rational than earthlings in everything. But there is something much more rational on Earth than what they have."</p><p>I paid no attention to Anastasia's last sentence. I was interested in Arkaan's next actions. He continued to give voice commands, and the following events took place in the room.</p><p>An armchair suddenly started to inflate from part of the wall. Beside the armchair, another small niche opened, out of which came a little table with a translucent, sealed vessel that looked like a laboratory beaker. On the opposite wall, a large screen about a meter and a half or two on the diagonal lit up. Sitting in an armchair on the screen was a beautiful woman in a tight-fitting coverall. The woman was holding a vessel like the one on the table next to Arkaan. The woman appeared in 3D, much better than on our televisions. She seemed to be sitting right in the room, not on the screen. As Anastasia explained, Arkaan and the woman sitting opposite him had made a child. "The inhabitants of this planet do not have emotions sufficiently strong to engage in sexual relations, like people on Earth. Outwardly, their bodies are no different from ours, but the lack of emotion keeps them from producing offspring the way we do on Earth. The test tubes you see now have their cells and hormones in them. The man and woman imagine what kind of future child they would like to have, his appearance. They mentally bestow upon him the information they have and discuss his future activities. This process lasts about three years in Earth time. As soon as they decide the process of shaping their child is complete, the contents of the two vessels are combined in a special laboratory, they produce a child, and he is raised in a special nursery and school until adulthood. They present the new adult member of the community with an apartment and include him in one of the working groups."</p><p>Arkaan looked at the woman on the screen and then at the small sealed vessel of liquid in front of him. Suddenly, the built-in screen went out, but the extraterrestrial remained sitting in his chair, looking steadily at the small vessel on the table in front of him with a particle of his future child. Little red squares began flash on the opposite wall. The extraterrestrial turned sideways to the wall, blocked the blinking light with the palm of his hand, and leaned his head closer to his vessel. Immediately, new squares and triangles of light began flashing in alarm from the ceiling.</p><p>"The time the computer allocated for wakefulness for Arkaan has run out, and now the computer is insisting on the need for sleep," Anastasia explained.</p><p>But the extraterrestrial leaned his head even closer to his vessel and placed his palms on it.</p><p>The lights coming from the ceiling and wall stopped blinking. The room began to fill with something like a steam or gas. Anastasia's voice commented: "Now the computer will put Arkaan to sleep with sleeping gas."</p><p>The extraterrestrial's head slowly began to lean toward the table and soon after lay down on it and his eyes shut. The armchair began moving away from the wall and turned into a bed. Then the chair-bed rocked from side to side, and the body of the already sleeping extraterrestrial fell on his comfortable bed.</p><p>Arkaan slept holding his small vessel in his hand, pressed to his chest.</p><p>I could tell you a lot more about the technical perfections of the unusual apartment and the large planet in general. According to Anastasia, its inhabitants are not afraid of any invasion from without. Furthermore, their technology can destroy life on any planet in the Universe, except Earth.</p><p>"Why?" I asked. "You mean our missiles and weapons can deflect their attacks?"</p><p>Anastasia replied, "They aren't afraid of earthly missiles, Vladimir. The community on this planet has long since learned everything about secondary explosion expansion. They also know about compression explosion."</p><p>"What is compression explosion?</p><p>"On Earth, we know how two or more substances combine in an instantaneous reaction and expand to produce an explosion. But there is another kind of reaction from the contact of two substances. A gaseous substance of a cubic kilometer or more can in a single instant compress to the size of a pea and become a super-solid material. Imagine a shell or missile exploding in this kind of a cloud but simultaneously another forces counters the expansion explosion and a compression explosion occurs simultaneously. All you hear then is a clap, and everything in that cloud turns into a pea-sized stone. Earthly missiles cannot overcome a curtain of gaseous clouds.</p><p>"In the history of the Earth, there have been two attacks from their direction. Now they are readying a third. They believe a propitious moment has arrived again."</p><p>"So there is no way to oppose them if there are no weapons on Earth more powerful than what they have."</p><p>"Man does have a weapon. It is called human thought. Even I alone could turn about half their weapons to dust and scatter the dust through the Universe. If I had helpers, together we could eliminate all the weaponry. Unfortunately, most people and nearly all the governments of Earth will perceive their coming as something good."</p><p>"How could everyone perceive their invasion and seizure as something good?"</p><p>"You're just about to see. Here, look at the center, which is preparing a landing force to conquer the Earth."</p><p>

Seizure Centre</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br><img src=http://ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/aliens-in-anastasias-glade-vk.com-kumar82.jpg></div></p><p> </p><p>Naturally, I expected to see interplanetary supertechnology capable of subduing an entire planet. But what appeared before my eyes . . . I don't think American and other military specialists would ever guess the weapons that could so easily subdue the territories they supposedly defend. Now you, dear readers, before reading further, try to imagine the weaponry of extraterrestrials preparing to seize Earth. Then you will see what it looks like in fact. Outwardly it looks like this.</p><p>A huge square building. On each of the building's four sides there are full-size replicas of the interiors of our earthly parliaments, State Duma, and office of our President in the Kremlin. On the opposite side of the hall are the interiors of the American Parliament and the President's White House office. On the other two sides of the hall are the interiors of the state organs of, apparently, Asian countries. Our earthly deputies, congressmen, and presidents sit in the parliamentary chairs. At first, I examined the replicas of our Russian deputies. They were an exact copy of those familiar faces I have had occasion to see on television. However, they sat without moving, like mummies. It's hard to say what they were made of. They might have been puppets, holograms, or robots, or maybe something else.</p><p>In the middle of the huge hall, about fifty extraterrestrials sat in armchairs placed on a dais. They were not wearing their usual coveralls but our earthly suits, and they were listening to the person speaking before them. The speaker was probably their main instructor or some other sort of superior.</p><p>Anastasia explained that I was watching one of their landing parties, now taking another class to prepare them to interact with earthly governments. They studied the most widespread languages on earth and people's behavior in different situations. They were preparing especially carefully for contact with earthly governments and legislative bodies, through which they hoped to influence the Earth's entire population. Conversational speech came easily to them, but due to their lack of certain feelings capable of calling forth visible emotions, it was hard for them to learn the gestures and facial expressions of earthly people. Furthermore, their logical habits of thought just couldn't grasp the logic in the system of state governance on Earth. Despite bringing in the best minds and most advanced technology of their civilization, they simply could not guess, for example, the following secret: Why, despite the computer technology the Earth already had, did the many special scientific institutions not present state legislative bodies with information about the consequences of the decisions they took? These aliens were convinced that given a central analytic center, for which the Earth already had everything it needed, social phenomena could be modeled almost exactly, depending on the sum total of decisions taken. However, each member of an earthly government, each legislator, was supposed to act independently and decide on his own. Without sufficient information, each member of government had to carry out the functions of a powerful analytical center and in so doing calculate the consequences of the behavior of his colleagues, enemies, and friends.</p><p>Another very mysterious issue not solved by the extraterrestrials was why earthly people did not decide on the goal they had to reach. They strove toward something, but what exactly that was was kept a deep dark secret. Nevertheless, assuming present-day requirements of earthly communities of people, the extraterrestrials were preparing a plan for seizing the Earth's continents. They would start implementing their plan by means of proposals to earthlings made through the governments of various countries. Their proposals would be accepted with delight.</p><p>When I asked Anastasia why she was so certain about the decisions of earthly governments, this answer followed:</p><p>"That is what their analysis center has calculated. The center's conclusion is correct. The present-day level of awareness of most earthlings will consider what the extraterrestrials propose to be the highest manifestation of the humanity of the cosmic Intellect.</p><p>"And what are these proposals?"</p><p>"They are monstrous, Vladimir. I don't like talking about them."</p><p>"At least tell me the main parts. I would like to know what these monstrous proposals are that will be received with such joy on Earth, where, after all, we both live."</p><p>"The extraterrestrials plan to land a small force first consisting of three flying apparatuses, in the territory of Russia. They will inform the military that surrounds them of their desire to meet with governmental circles with regard to cooperation. They will introduce themselves to the military as representatives of the Supreme Universal Intellect and will demonstrate the superiority of their technology to them.</p><p>"After meetings in military, scientific, and governmental circles, after about fourteen days, they will be asked to make their proposals specific but first to undergo an examination to establish the safety of contact with them.</p><p>"The space aliens will agree to examination and will present their proposals in written form and on videocassettes. The text will be set out in a form very similar to official documents today and will be distinguished by maximum simplicity.</p><p>"The content of the text will be approximately as follows:</p><p>"'We are representatives of an extraterrestrial civilization that has achieved a higher technological development than the other rational inhabitants of the galaxies, and we consider the people of Earth our brothers in intellect.</p><p>"'We are prepared to share our knowledge in various areas of science and social development with the earthly communities and to offer our technologies.</p><p>"'We ask you to consider our proposals and choose the most acceptable of them for improving the life of every member of society.'</p><p>"Then will follow many specific proposals, the essence of which will boil down to the following.</p><p>"The space aliens will offer their technologies to provide all of the country's inhabitants with nutritional mixtures and swift construction of housing for each person who has reached adulthood. The same kind of buildings you have already seen, only with fewer functions. As an example, they would supply the country with their mini-factories. They would combine the extraterrestrial factories with existing earthly ones, but in five years all the earthly technologies will have been used and replaced by technically more rational ones. Everyone wanting to work would be given a job. Not only that, absolutely every inhabitant of Earth would have to apply the necessary minimum of working hours to maintain the equipment.</p><p>"The country that reached an agreement with the space aliens would be fully protected from military invasion by other countries. The society with the new social structure and technically equipped daily life would have no crime. In your apartment, you would be given everything necessary. The apartment would react only to commands issued by your voice with the timbre characteristic of it alone. Daily, before consumption of food, your apartment's computer would determine your physical condition based on your eyeball and the composition of the air you breathed and other parameters and prescribe the appropriate composition of your nutritive mixture.</p><p>"Each computer installed in an individual apartment would be linked to the main one. In this way, the location of each person would be known, as would his physical and psychological condition. Any crime could be easily solved using a special program on the main computer, and there would be no social base for breeding crime.</p><p>"In exchange, the aliens intended to ask the government for the opportunity to settle representatives of their civilization in lightly populated regions—forests mainly—the right to exchange individual gardens for the new highly advanced apartments, and lifelong security for everyone wishing to exchange their piece of land.</p><p>The government would agree, since they would retain full power, or so they would think. Several religions would start to preach that the space aliens were God's emissaries since they did not reject a single one of the religions that existed on Earth. Religious leaders who did not believe in the space aliens' Divine perfection would not be able to counter them, due to their acceptance by most of the country that had reached the agreement. Other countries would want to try to cooperate with the aliens. Nine years after their appearance on Earth on all continents and in all countries, the new way of life would quickly take root, and more and more new developments in technology and social structure would be propagandized through all the information channels. The majority of the population would praise the representatives of the cosmic Intellect as their more perfect brothers in intellect, like gods.</p><p>"With good reason," I commented. "There is nothing bad in there not being wars or crime on Earth. An apartment, food, and work for each person."</p><p>"Vladimir, have you really not understood that by accepting the extraterrestrials' conditions, humanity would be giving up its own nonmaterial, Divine self? It would be killing itself. All that would remain would be material bodies. Each person would come to resemble a biorobot more and more, Vladimir. All earthly children would be born biorobots."</p><p>"But why?"</p><p>"All people would be compelled to serve daily the mechanisms that outwardly serve them. All humanity would fall into the trap and give up their freedom and their children for the perfection of artificial technology. Intuitively, many earthlings would immediately sense their mistake and then they would start committing suicide."</p><p>"Strange. What would they be lacking?"</p><p>"Freedom, creativity, and the sensations that only creation aided by the Divine can offer."</p><p>"And what if the parliaments and governments of Earth don't accede to agreements with the extraterrestrials? What will happen then? Will they start destroying humanity?"</p><p>"Then the extraterrestrial minds will start searching for other paths to lure everybody into their trap. It makes no sense for them to destroy humanity. After all, their goal is to know the interconnection among all earthly creations and by what power their reproduction is created. Nothing of the kind can be done without man. Man himself is the chief link in the chain of the harmony of earthly creation. Even the Sun's rays are a part of the energies and feelings that many people reproduce. Given today's consciousness, the aliens are not afraid of the people of Earth, and even now many earthlings are trying to help them."</p><p>"How can that be? Who among us helps them? Does this mean there are traitors among people? They're working for them?"</p><p>"Yes, they are, but those people are not traitors. Their complicity is acquired without their will, not maliciously, not intentionally. The main reason is their lack of faith in themselves and in the perfection of God's creations."</p><p>"What kind of interconnection is here?"</p><p>"A simple one. When a person allows the thought that he is not a perfect creation, when he suddenly begins to imagine that beings on other planets have a more powerful intellect, he himself feeds them with his thought. Man himself dims his Divine power and does not direct power to the Divine creations. They have learned to collect the energy produced by human thoughts and feelings into a single complex and they are proud of this. Look, there is a vessel before the group of extraterrestrials, and in it a liquid is glowing, first turning into a gas, then solidifying. They have no stronger weapon than what is contained in that small vessel. Later, they will divide all of its contents into many small, flat vessels. One of its walls will be a special reflector. They will hang a device like this on their chest. All those sitting in front of you already have them. When this kind of device directs its ray at a human being, it can give rise in the human being to fear, worship, or admiration. It can paralyze the human will, consciousness, and body. The thoughts of many people are contained in that ray. People's thoughts that there is someone more powerful than man in the Universe—than man, God's creation. And their thoughts can be used to counter those very same people."</p><p>"So we ourselves add to their power when we extol them as more intelligent than ourselves?"</p><p>"Yes, that's right. More intelligent than ourselves, which means more intelligent than God."</p><p>"What does God have to do with this?"</p><p>"We are all His creations. When we believe that there are worlds more perfect in the galaxies, we are implying that we are imperfect, that God's creations are imperfect."</p><p>"That's just great. Has a lot of this kind of energy accumulated in the extraterrestrial world?"</p><p>"There is enough in the vessel before you to subdue approximately three-fourths of all earthly minds and to master human feelings. They believe that this is enough and then some. Then worship of the civilization the aliens created on Earth will begin, and the aliens' might will increase."</p><p>"Does this mean that nothing can be done?"</p><p>"It can, if a risk is taken that they are not expecting. After all, the full set of human feelings, even that of one person, is always more powerful. Thought can be accelerated to incredible rates in those who do not possess feelings, and all the energy gathered in the vessel can be neutralized by the energy of another thought that is brighter, more confident, and more perfect."</p><p>"And you, Anastasia, could you neutralize all the energy contained in the vessel?"</p><p>"I could try, but I would need to gather my whole body here for that."</p><p>"What for?"</p><p>"My set of feelings will be incomplete without my body. Matter is one of the planes of human existence. With it, man is more powerful than the universal essences."</p><p>"So gather it to break the vessel."</p><p>"I'm going to try to do something now without breaking it."</p><p>And all of a sudden I saw Anastasia before me in the flesh. Everything on her was as it had been in the forest, the blouse, the skirt. Her bare feet were standing on the floor and suddenly she started walking unhurriedly toward those sitting before the vessel with the glowing liquid. They saw her. The unfeeling extraterrestrials' faces did not express any emotions. But they only sat without stirring for one instant. A second later everyone had stirred. All of a sudden, as if on someone's command, they stood up, and each picked up the medallion hanging on his chest. All the medallions burst out in rays. All the rays were aimed toward Anastasia walking toward them.</p><p>She stopped, swayed, and suddenly took a small step back, stopped again, smiled, tapped her bare foot, and slowly, confidently, started forward again.</p><p>The rays coming from the extraterrestrials' medallions became brighter and brighter, merging into one aimed at Anastasia. It seemed that they would incinerate all her clothing in an instant. But Anastasia kept walking forward. She suddenly held her hands out in front and extinguished several rays, deflecting them with her palms, and then the rest began to go out.</p><p>The extraterrestrials stood as before, without stirring. Anastasia walked up to the vessel, placed her palms on its sides, stroked the vessel, and whispered something to it. The liquid in the vessel suddenly started to seethe. Then its light began to go out little by little, and soon after, the liquid in the vessel had become slightly blue. Like ordinary water on Earth.</p><p>Anastasia walked up to the machine by the wall that looked like an earthly refrigerator. She placed her palm on it, whispered something, and the machine spat colored square tablets out into the lifted hem of her blouse.</p><p>Anastasia walked up to the extraterrestrials, who were still standing there mute, and held out a tablet from the machine to the one on the end. The extraterrestrial stirred and was about to reach for it but immediately fell still, then began to stare at the person standing in front of them all, probably their leader. Anastasia stood like that in front of him with her hand held out for about half a minute. Then she walked right up to the leader and held out a tablet to him. After a pause, the leader took the tablet and put it in his mouth. Anastasia went around to everyone present, and each now calmly took the tablets and chewed or swallowed them. Then she walked away from them toward me, stopped halfway, turned toward the group of sitting extraterrestrials, and waved to them. A few extraterrestrials rose from their seats and waved to her in reply.</p><p>When she came even with me, Anastasia said in a weary voice, "We need to return. They have now taken tablets that accelerate thought. Let them try to make sense of what has happened here."</p><p>And it was all over. I lay on the forest grass as before, as if I had awakened from a deep sleep. It seemed as if very little time had passed, but my body felt rested, like after a deep, healthy sleep. But my head . . . Everything seemed to be seething inside, as if my thoughts were flowing in different directions at once. The pictures I had seen on the other planet—everything remained wholly inside me. What was that? A dream? Hypnosis? Or all that put together? I couldn't understand. It was impossible to believe in the reality of seeing a planet other than Earth, and I asked Anastasia sitting next to me, "What was that? A dream? Hypnosis?" I remembered everything, and now there was a kind of chaos in my mind.</p><p>She replied, "Vladimir, decide for yourself, as you like, by what power the vision of the other planet appeared before you. Since the question makes you uneasy, agree to say you were dreaming. All that doesn't matter. What does matter is the essence, the conclusions and feelings from the vision. Think about them, and I will go away for a little while."</p><p>"Yes, go away, and I will think about it myself."</p><p>I began thinking about what I had seen when I was left alone. Of course, I decided I had dreamed some kind of hypnotic dream.</p><p>After taking a few steps, Anastasia suddenly turned around, walked up to me again, and took something out of her blouse pocket and held her open palm out to me. In her palm lay the strange tablet I had seen on the other planet.</p><p>"Take it, Vladimir. You can swallow it without fear. They make it from earthly herbs on the planet where we were. It will help accelerate your thinking for about fifteen minutes, so you can make sense of what you've experienced more quickly."</p><p>I took the small tablet from her outstretched palm, and when Anastasia left, I ate it.</p><p>

 </p><p><div class=chapter id=0424>************************ ************************ ***********************</br><h2>24. Bring Back Your Homeland, People</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>At first, I could not make sense of my dialog with Anastasia about our homeland. Her opinions seemed abnormal at first. But then . . . Even now I can't help remembering them. I remember how she answered my questions about what needs to be done to abolish interplanetary and earthly wars and crime and to make sure children are born happy and healthy.</p><p>She replied, "All people need to be advised, Vladimir: 'Bring back your homeland, people.'"</p><p>"'Bring back your homeland'? Might you have made a mistake saying that, Anastasia? Everyone has a homeland. They just don't all live there. Not 'bring your homeland' but 'go to your homeland.' Is that what you meant to say?"</p><p>"Vladimir, I didn't make a mistake. Most people living on the planet now have no homeland at all."</p><p>"What do you mean they don't? Russians have Russia, Englishmen have England. Everyone was born in some country, and that country is called his homeland."</p><p>"Do you think that your homeland needs to be measured with a border someone decided on?"</p><p>"How else? That's how we do things. All states have borders."</p><p>"But if there were no borders, how could you define your homeland?"</p><p>"The place where I was born, the city or village, but maybe the whole Earth was a homeland to all then."</p><p>"The whole Earth could be a homeland for everyone living on it, and the whole universe could caress man, but for that to happen all the planes of existence would have to merge at a single point. Call that point your homeland, and in it create your Dimension of Love. All the universe's best would be in contact with it. With your dimension of homeland. You would feel yourself through that Universal point and possess unsurpassed power. Other worlds would know about that. Everything would serve you, as God, our Creator, wanted it."</p><p>"You should speak simply, Anastasia. I didn't understand anything about the planes of being and how to merge them or about the point I can call my homeland."</p><p>"Then we have to start the conversation from birth."</p><p>"Well, from birth then. Only don't just talk, make sense for the present day. For instance, how do you imagine the idea of conceiving a family, the birth and rearing of children in present-day conditions, so that all children are born happy? Can you construct a diagram like that or draw a picture?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then speak, but not about life in the forest or some incomprehensible science of imageness. No one knows about that, only you . . ."</p><p>I couldn't finish my sentence. Not one, but many questions seemed to be racing through my head in a noisy stream. And the main ones were these: Why wonder what a taiga hermit might tell me about our life? How does she know not only the outward details of our life but also the inner experiences of so many? What possibilities does this incomprehensible science of imageness have? I couldn't sit still. I stood up and started pacing back and forth. To calm myself and to comprehend, understand this unlikelihood, I began to reason: "Here is a calm young woman sitting under a cedar. First, she runs her hand slowly over the grass, then she looks carefully at some bug crawling across her hand, then she lapses briefly into thought. She sits in the taiga far from the stormy life of cities and countries, from the wars and reversals in the fortunes of all kinds of civilizations. But what if she knows this science of imageness perfectly? What if, with its help, she can influence people, exert a more powerful influence on society than governments, parliaments, and the many religions? Incredible! Fantastic! However . . . There are concrete facts attesting to this—incredible facts! which nevertheless exist in reality.</p><p>In a short period of time, she taught me to write books. It took her only three days. It is she who keeps spouting a continuous stream of information. It's incredible, but it's a fact. Books easily cross the borders of cities and countries without advertising. Her image is in the books. In some unknown way, this image influences people and calls forth a creative surge in them. Thousands of poetic lines and hundreds of songs by bards are dedicated to her image. Moreover, she knew all about it in advance. Back in the first book I quoted what she said about this. At the time, there was none of this. At the time, her words seemed like incredible raving, fantasy. But it all came to pass exactly as she said, and as I write these lines, more incredible events have taken place.</p><p>In July 1999, Prof Press Publishers put out a five-hundred-page anthology of readers' letters and poems. The anthology came out in July, which booksellers consider the dead season. Something incredible happens: the first printing of fifteen thousand sells out in one month.</p><p>Another fifteen thousand are issued, and these anthologies are also bought up immediately. The event isn't spectacular enough for the sensation offered up by the press. In general it goes beyond notions of sensation because of the oddity of the conclusions behind it. These conclusions are hard to believe. It's also hard to believe that Anastasia's image is changing society's consciousness.</p><p>Readers have experienced a need for action. People in Russia and beyond its borders are independently organizing reading clubs and centers named after her.</p><p>A Novosibirsk pharmaceutical factory is producing the cedar oil she spoke about. In a small village in Novosibirsk Province local residents are restoring equipment and trying to extract the healing oil according to her technology, and they are getting help from the city.</p><p>This is what she said, that Siberian villages would be reborn, that children would begin to return to their parents.</p><p>They would divert the stream of pilgrims from foreign holy places to native ones. In the last two years alone, the dolmens near Gelendzhik that she talked about have been visited by more than fifty thousand of her readers. People are now planting flowers and gardens around the previously forgotten sacred places. In different cities cedars are being planted as well as other plants according to her method.</p><p>The head of the Tomsk Province administration decreed the founding of Siberian Wild Harvest, and they have sent four thousand cedar saplings to Moscow.</p><p>Scientists talk about her. It is her image of a vital, self-sufficient substance that is already sailing over Russia. But only over Russia?</p><p>Women in Kazakhstan are collecting money to shoot a film about Anastasia. Imagine, the Kazakh women want a film about a Siberian hermit!</p><p>It is her image that has begun to lead people somewhere. Where? By what power? Who is helping her? She herself may possess some kind of incredible, previously unknown power. But why does she remain in her glade and still bother with bugs?</p><p>While intellectuals argue over whether she exists at all, she simply acts. The manifestation of her actions can be seen, touched, and tasted. What does this science of imageness mean?</p><p>At the time, in the taiga, these thoughts frightened me a little. I wanted either to refute them quickly or be firmly convinced of them, but I only had her to ask.</p><p>I will now. She is incapable of lying. I will now.</p><p>"Anastasia, tell me. . . . Tell me, do you know the science of imageness perfectly? Do you possess the knowledge of those ancient priests?"</p><p>I awaited her answer in agitation, but her calm voice replied without any.</p><p>"I know what my forefather taught those priests and what the priests would not let my father say. I have also tried to know and feel more that was new."</p><p>"Now I understand! I expected this! You have learned the science of imageness better than anyone, and having created your own image, you have appeared before people. For many, you are a goddess, a good forest fairy, a messiah. That is how readers write about you in their letters. You told me that pride and egoism were a great sin, that I had to write everything sincerely, and I appeared before all as defective. But you yourself at the same time rose high above all, and you yourself knew for a fact that it would be this way."</p><p>"Vladimir, I did not hide anything from you."</p><p>Anastasia rose from the grass, stood opposite me, her arms lowered. She looked into my eyes, and continued.</p><p>"My image is still not understandable to everyone, but that image, the other one, when it appears before people, will still be mine. My image will resemble the cleaning woman who merely removes the spider web from the main thing."</p><p>"What spider web? Speak more clearly, Anastasia. What else do you want to create?"</p><p>"I want to revive God's image before people. To make His great dream understandable to each person. Each person will be able to feel his aspirations in love. Today man can become happy in this life. The children of today's people will all live in His Paradise. I am not alone. You are not alone. And paradise will be the shared creation."</p><p>"Wait, wait up. Now I understand. Your words are breaking many teachings. Their authors and followers will not only attack you but will go after me, too. What do I need these problems for? I'm not going to write everything you say about God."</p><p>"Vladimir, you're frightened of merely an impending fight with you-don't-know-who."</p><p>"Yes, I understand everything. All those who head up the different religions will pounce. They'll set their fanatic followers on me."</p><p>"You are afraid of yourself, not them, Vladimir. You yourself are ashamed to stand before God. You do not believe in your new way of life. You do not believe you can change."</p><p>"What do I have to do with this? I'm telling you about the higher clergy and how many of them are reacting to your statements."</p><p>"What are they telling you?"</p><p>"Different things. Some are responding badly, some just the opposite, and one Orthodox priest from Ukraine came with his parishioners to visit me, in order to support your statements. But he's a village priest."</p><p>"And what does it mean that the priest who came to see you was a village one?"</p><p>
"It means that there are still others, highly placed. Everyone obeys them. Everything depends on them."</p><p>"But after all, even those highly placed ones, as you put it, also once served in small churches."</p><p>"That doesn't matter. I'm still not going to write until at least someone from the leadership of a serious temple . . . Oh, what am I saying? After all, you yourself can say everything in advance. So tell me, who is going to oppose you, and who is going to help? Will there be anyone at all who will help?"</p><p>"What rank of priest would convince you to be braver, Vladimir?"</p><p>"Can you name me someone no lower than a father superior or bishop?"</p><p>She thought for just a moment, as if she were gazing into time and space all at once.</p><p>And I heard an incredible answer.</p><p>"The Roman Pope John Paul II has already helped by saying words about God in a new way," Anastasia replied. "The images of Christ and Mohammad will unite their energies in space, and other images will become one with them. There will also be an Orthodox patriarch and what he said will be honored through the ages. But bursts of inspiration will be the main thing among all the outwardly simple people. Their earthly status is important to you, but the truth is more important than anything in the world, after all."</p><p>She fell silent, lowering her eyes, as if something had suddenly offended her. As if a lump had come up her throat and she swallowed it and sighed.</p><p>Then she said, "Forgive me for explaining myself incomprehensibly to your soul. It isn't working yet, but I will try to be more understandable. Still, you must talk to people."</p><p>"What about?"</p><p>"About what some have been trying to hide from them for millennia. About the fact that each can in one instant enter into the Creator's primordial garden and achieve beautiful joint creations with Him."</p><p>I felt the agitation mounting in her, and I myself began to get agitated for some reason.</p><p>"Don't get upset, Anastasia," I said. "Tell me and maybe I can understand and write."</p><p>There was maximal specificity and simplicity in what she went on to tell me. Later, analyzing and recalling her words, I began to understand that there may have been some considerable meaning in her words: "Bring back your homeland, people." But then, in the forest, I asked Anastasia for clarification.</p><p>"I understand how all this is going to happen. I understand that if you are capable of producing pictures from the lives of a thousand years ago so easily, then you must know all the teachings and treatises. You will reveal them to people, right?"</p><p>"I know the teachings that have aroused worship in people."</p><p>"All of them?"</p><p>"Yes, all of them."</p><p>"You can translate the Vedas in full?"</p><p>"I can. Only why waste time on that?"</p><p>"But don't you want humanity to learn the most ancient teachings? Tell me about them and I'll write it in the book."</p><p>"And what then? What do you think will happen to humanity as a result?"</p><p>"What? They will be wiser."</p><p>"Vladimir, the whole subterfuge of the dark forces is that they are trying to hide the main thing from man through a multitude of teachings that offer some of the truth merely for the mind and diligently lead away from the main thing."</p><p>"Then why do people call those who offer the teachings wise men?"</p><p>"Vladimir, if you will allow me, I will tell you a parable—one that a millennium ago, in a secluded spot, the wise men whispered to each other. No one has heard it for many centuries."</p><p>"Tell me, if you think the parable might explain something."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0425>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>25.

For a long time, they had no children. At an advanced age, the wife gave birth to two sons, two twins, two brothers. The births were difficult, and soon after she had borne the two sons, the woman departed for the other world.</p><p>The father hired a wet nurse and tried to rear his children. He raised them until the age of fourteen. But he himself died when the sons turned fifteen. The two brothers buried their father in sorrow and sat in their chamber—the two twins. Three minutes separated their appearance in the world, and so one was considered older and the other younger. After a mournful silence, the older brother spoke.</p><p>"As he was dying, our father expressed his sorrow to us that he had not had time to convey to us the wisdom of life. How will you and I live, my younger brother, without wisdom? Our line will continue unhappy without wisdom. Those who have had time to take wisdom from their fathers might laugh at us."</p><p>"Do not be sad," the younger told the older. "You are often in reverie. Perhaps time will see to it that you learn wisdom in your reverie. I will do everything you say. I can live without reverie, and living will be pleasant for me anyway. I rejoice when the day arrives and when the sun sets. I will simply live and work on the farm, and you will learn wisdom."</p><p>"Agreed," the older answered the younger. "Only wisdom cannot be sought by staying in the house. It is not here, no one has left it here, no one will bring it to us here. But I have decided: I am the older brother, and I myself must find everything that is wise in the world for us both, for our line, which will live on down the ages. I must find it, bring it to our home, and give it to us and to our descendants. I will take everything of value our father left us and go all around the world, to all the wise men of different countries, learn all their sciences, and return to our dear home."</p><p>"Your journey will be long," the younger brother said compassionately. "We have a horse. Take the horse and wagon, load as much good as you can, so you will be less poor on the road. I will stay home and await the wiser you."</p><p>The brothers parted for a long time. Years passed. The older brother went from wise man to wise man, temple to temple, learned the teachings of the East and West, spent time in the North and in the South. He had a magnificent memory, and his sharp mind grasped quickly and remembered everything easily.</p><p>The older brother roamed the world for sixty years or so. His hair and beard turned gray. His keen mind kept wandering and learning wisdom, and he, now a gray wanderer, came to be considered the wisest of men. A throng of disciples followed him. He generously propagated his wisdom to their keen minds. Both young and old heeded him with delight. Great fame preceded him, informing settlements on his path of the wise man's great coming.</p><p>In his halo of glory, surrounded by a crowd of subservient disciples, the gray-haired wise man came closer and closer to the settlement where he was born and which he had left as a youth of fifteen, sixty years before.</p><p>All the people from the settlement came to meet him, and his younger brother, also with gray hair, ran out to greet him, rejoicing, and bowed his head before his brother, the wise man.</p><p>He joyously whispered, "Bless me, my brother and wise man. Come into our home, and I will wash your feet after your long journey. Come into our home, my wise brother, and rest."</p><p>With a majestic gesture, the wise man ordered all his pupils to remain on the hillock, accept the gifts of those who met them, and hold wise discussions. He followed his younger brother into the house. The majestic and gray-haired wise man sat down at the table in the chamber wearily. The younger brother began washing his feet with warm water and listening to the speeches of his brother and wise man.</p><p>"I have done my duty," the wise man told him. "I have learned the teachings of the great wise men and set forth my own teaching. I will not stay long in the house, for now teaching others is my lot. But since I promised to bring wisdom to our house, I will spend a day with you keeping this promise. In that time, I will tell you the wisest truths, my younger brother. Here is the first. All people must live in a beautiful garden."</p><p>Drying his feet with a clean, beautifully embroidered towel, the younger bustled about, trying to please the older, and he said to him, "Taste. On the table before you are fruits from our garden. I gathered the best of them for you."</p><p>The wise man ate all kinds of beautiful fruits thoughtfully and continued.</p><p>"It is essential that every person living on earth himself cultivate an ancestral tree. When he dies, that tree will remain as a good memory for his descendants. It will clean the air his descendants breathe. We must all breathe good air."</p><p>The younger brother rushed and bustled about and said. "Forgive me, my wise brother, I forgot to open the window so that you could breathe fresh air." He pulled back the curtain, opened the window, and continued. "Here, breathe the air of our two cedars. I planted them the year you left. I dug one hole for a sapling with my own shovel, and for the second hole I dug with the shovel you played with when we were children."</p><p>The wise man gazed thoughtfully at the trees and then continued.</p><p>"Love is a great emotion. Not everyone is given to live his life with love. There is a great wisdom: each person must strive for love every day."</p><p>"Oh, how wise you are, my older brother!" the younger exclaimed. "You have learned great wisdom, and I have lost my head before you. Forgive me, I have not even introduced you to my wife." And he shouted, turning toward the door: "Old woman, where are you, my helpmeet?"</p><p>"Here I am," a cheerful old woman appeared in the doorway carrying steaming pies on a platter. "I was held up with the pies."</p><p>She placed the pies on the table, and the cheerful old woman made a funny curtsey before the brothers. She walked up close to the younger, her spouse, and said in a half-whisper, but the older brother heard the whisper.</p><p>"And now, you men, forgive me, I am going now, I have to lie down."</p><p>"What's the matter with you, silly, all of a sudden deciding to rest? We have a dear guest, my own brother, while you . . ."</p><p>"It's not me, my head is spinning, and I feel a little nauseated."</p><p>"And why on earth would you be having any trouble here?"</p><p>"Maybe you are to blame. We must be having a child again," the old woman said with a laugh, running away.</p><p>"Forgive me, my brother," the younger brother apologized in embarrassment to the older. "She doesn't know the value of wisdom. She was always cheerful, and in her old age you see she remains a cheery sort."</p><p>The thoughtful wise man paused a little longer. The sound of children's voices interrupted his reverie. The wise man heard them and said, "Each person must strive to know great wisdom. How to raise children who are happy and just."</p><p>"Know, wise brother, I thirst to make my children and grandchildren happy. Here you see them coming in, my noisy grandkids."</p><p>Two boys no older than six and a little girl of about four were standing in the doorway arguing.</p><p>Trying to get them to settle down, the younger brother told them hurriedly, "Tell me quickly what has happened to you, you noisy children, and don't keep us from our conversation."</p><p>"Oh!" the smaller boy exclaimed. "One grandfather's turned into two. Which is ours and which isn't? How can we tell?"</p><p>"Here's our dear granddad, isn't it clear?"</p><p>And the little granddaughter ran up to the younger of the brothers, pressed her cheek to his leg, ruffled his beard, and prattled, "Granddad, dear granddad, I alone rushed to you to show you how I've learned to dance, and my brothers tagged along. One wants to draw with you. See? He brought his board and chalk. The second brought his pipe and horn, and he wants you to play the horn and pipe for him. But I decided to come see you first. Tell them all that. Send them back where they came from, Granddad."</p><p>"No, I came to draw first. Then my brother decided to come with me to play the horn," said the grandson with the thin piece of board.</p><p>"There are two of you granddads," the granddaughter prattled. "Will you decide which of us came first? Pick me or else I'll cry bitter tears."</p><p>The wise man looked at the grandchildren with a smile and sorrow. Preparing an answer and frowning as he concentrated, the wise man still did not say anything. The younger brother was bustling about and did not let the pause that arose lengthen.</p><p>He quickly took the horn from the child's hands and without thinking said, "There is no reason for you to argue at all. Dance, my beauty and hopper, and I will play a dance on the horn. My dear musician will help me play the pipe. And you, artist, draw what the sounds of the music draw and what the ballerina dances. Draw it. Now then, everyone get busy quickly."</p><p>The younger brother played a cheerful and beautiful melody on the pipe, and the grandchildren all repeated after him simultaneously, choosing their favorite thing to depict. The future great musician tried not to lag behind on the melody on the pipe. As a ballerina, the little girl hopped, turning red, joyously depicting her dance. The future artist joyfully drew his picture.</p><p>The wise man was silent. The wise man learned. . . . When the merriment was over, he stood up and said, "Remember, my younger brother, our father's old chisel and hammer, give them to me. I want to chisel our main lesson in stone. I am leaving now. I probably will not return. Don't try to stop me, and don't wait."</p><p>The older brother left. The gray-haired wise man and his disciples walked up to the stone; the path went round that stone—the path that called the seeker of wisdom to distant lands away from his own home. The day passed, night came, and the gray-haired wise man hammered and chiseled an inscription in the stone. When the exhausted gray-haired old man finished, his disciples read the inscription on the stone:</p><p>"All you seek, wanderer, you carry with you. You will find nothing new, and you will lose with every step."</p><p>Anastasia fell silent, having told her parable, and she looked searchingly into my eyes. She probably wondered what I had gotten from the parable.</p><p>"Anastasia, I understood that all the wisdom the older brother had been talking about the younger brother had made concrete in life. Only I don't understand who taught the younger brother all this wisdom."</p><p>"No one. All universal wisdom is contained in each human soul in perpetuity, from the moment of the soul's creation. Wise men often lead souls away from the main thing for their own benefit without further ado."</p><p>"The main thing? But what is the main thing?"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0426>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>26. Each Can Build His Home Today</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br></div></p><p> </p><p>"The main thing, Vladimir, is that each person can build a home today. He can feel God and live in paradise. Just one instant separates the people living on Earth today from paradise. There is awareness inside each person. When postulates do not hinder awareness, then, Vladimir, look."</p><p>Anastasia was suddenly merry. She grabbed me by the hand and, pulling me toward the bare ground of the lake's shore, she began speaking quickly as she walked.</p><p>"Right now. You'll understand everything very soon. People will understand everything—my readers, yours.</p><p>"They will determine the essence of the Earth and discover their own purpose. Very soon, Vladimir, here, we will build a house in our thoughts now! You and I and all of them. I assure you, believe me, each person's thought will touch the thought of God. The door to paradise will open. Let's go. Let's go quickly. I'll draw with a stick on the shore. . . . Together we will build a house with whoever touches you in the future through the written line. Human thought will become one. People have God's ability in them, to make what is thought a reality. More than one house will stand on the Earth. Each person in those houses will be able to comprehend everything. He himself will be able to feel and understand the aspirations of the Divine dream. We will build a house! They and I and you!"</p><p>"Anastasia, wait a minute. There are a lot of different designs for houses where modern people live. What can be the point of you proposing yet another design?"</p><p>"Vladimir, don't just listen to me. Feel everything I draw and mentally finish drawing the design yourself. Let each person draw it with me. Oh God! People, please, just try!"</p><p>Anastasia seemed to be trembling in joyous excitement. She was calling upon people, and greater and greater interest began to arise in me for her project. At first it seemed simple, and at the same time I got the feeling that the hermit Anastasia was revealing some unusual secret to all. The whole secret was in its unusual simplicity, but to tell it in order, here is how it all sounded.</p><p>Anastasia continued.</p><p>"First choose a place you like out of all the possible favorable places on Earth, a place where you would like to live, where you would want your children to live, and where you would be a good memory for your great-grandchildren. The climate in that place must be favorable for you. Take for the ages one hectare of land in that place for yourself."</p><p>"But no one can simply take land now just because he wants to. Land is sold only where people want to sell it."</p><p>"Yes, unfortunately, that is how it all does happen. Our homeland is vast, but there is not even a hectare of your land in it where you can create a corner of paradise for your children and descendants. Still, the time has come to begin. Of all the existing laws, you can make use of the most favorable."</p><p>"I don't know all the laws, of course, but I am confident that we do not have a law allowing each person to have some quantity of land in perpetuity. They lease many hectares of land to farmers, but not for more than ninety-nine years."</p><p>"Oh well, to begin with we can take it for a shorter time, but you must quickly create a law so that each person has a homeland, land. The state depends on this flowering. If there is no serious law, then it must be created."</p><p>"That's easy to say and hard to do. Laws are written by the State Duma. It must somehow amend the Constitution or add a chapter. But the parties in the Duma argue among themselves and there is no way they can solve the land issue."</p><p>"If there is no party capable of passing a law so that each person can have a homeland, then such a party must be created."</p><p>"Who is going to create it?"</p><p>"Someone who reads about the home being created and understands what a homeland means for each person, for each person living today and for the future of the entire Earth."</p><p>"All right, that's enough of parties. Why don't you tell me about your unusual house? I’m curious as to what new idea you can bring to design. Let's imagine that someone has a hectare of land. Not a paradise, but one overtaken by weeds. They probably won't give out anything better. So here a man stands on his hectare. Now what?"</p><p>"Vladimir, think for yourself. You dream, too. What actions would you take if you were standing on your own land?"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0427>************************ ************************ ************************</br><h2>27. A Fence</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br></div></p><p> </p><p>"First, of course, it all has to be surrounded by a fence. Otherwise, when you start bringing in building materials for the cottage, they could be stolen. And when you plant, thieves could steal your harvest later. Or are you opposed to a fence?"</p><p>"No. Even all animals mark their territory. But what will you use to build your fence?"</p><p>"What do you mean? Boards. No, wait. Boards might be kind of expensive. For starters, posts should be dug and the area surrounded in barbed wire. Later there can be boards, so no one can tell what is going on behind the fence."</p><p>"And how many years can a board fence stand without repair?"</p><p>"If the lumber is good and it has paint or roofing metal and those parts of the posts that go into the ground are painted with tar, the fence will go five years without repair, maybe even more."</p><p>"And then?"</p><p>"And then you have to repair it or paint it, so it doesn't rot."</p><p>"This means you are going to have to fuss with the fence constantly, and it will leave your children or grandchildren with even more trouble. Wouldn't it be better to arrange everything so that you do not leave your children rotting structures? Let's think about how to make the fence more solid and long-lasting, so your descendants remember you kindly."</p><p>"Of course, it can be more long-lasting. Who wouldn't want that? For instance, the posts could be brick and the foundation brick, and between the posts there could be cast-iron bars, which won't rust. A fence like would even last a hundred years, but only very rich people have the wherewithal to build that. Picture it. A hectare is four hundred meters along the perimeter. A fence like that would cost more than a hundred thousand rubles—and you might even pour millions of rubles into it. On the other hand, it would stand for a hundred or two hundred years. Maybe even more. It could be made with some kind of family coat of arms. Your descendants would look and remember their forefather, and everyone around would envy them."</p><p>"Envy is a bad feeling. It causes harm."</p><p>"But there's nothing to be done here. I'm telling you, not many are going to be able to surround their hectare with a good fence."</p><p>"That means we have to think up another fence."</p><p>"What other fence? Can you suggest something?"</p><p>"Wouldn't it be better, Vladimir, instead of lots of posts that are later going to rot, to plant trees?"</p><p>"Trees? And what, nail to them . . ."</p><p>"Why nail? Look here. Lots of trees grow in the forest and their trunks are a meter and half or two from each other."</p><p>"Yes, they do. But there are gaps between them. That doesn't make a fence."</p><p>"But between them you can plant impassable bushes. Look closely and picture what a beautiful fence that might make. Everyone would have one a little different, and each could gaze in admiration. Your descendants would remember you as the beautiful fence's creator through the ages. Time would not be taken from them to repair it, and it would bring benefits. It would function not only as a barrier. One fence should be made of birches growing in a row. Another from oaks. Some, in a creative surge, would make a fence of many colors, like in a fairytale."</p><p>"What kind of colors?"</p><p>"One might plant different-colored trees: birches, maples, oaks, cedars. Another could intertwine mountain ash with their burning red clusters and plant guelder rose between them. Still another could make room for bird cherries and lilac. You can think all of it through from the beginning. Each person must observe what grows—how high, how it blooms in spring, how it smells, and what kinds of birds it attracts. Your fence would be singing and fragrant and would never tire your gaze, since it would subtly change its pictures by a half-tone every day. It would bloom with the flower of spring and blaze with the colors of fall."</p><p>"Well, Anastasia, you're a kind of poet. A simple fence, and how you changed it all! You know, I like this turn very much. Why haven't people thought of this before? You don't have to paint or repair it. When it grows big it can be used for firewood and new trees planted in its place, thus changing the picture, like drawing. But it would take a long time for a fence like that to grow in. If you plant trees every two meters, you have to dig two hundred holes for saplings as well as plant bushes between them. And of course you're going to say not to use equipment."</p><p>"On the contrary, Vladimir. There is no point rejecting it for this project. Everything that was a manifestation of the dark forces has to be turned toward the forces of light. In order to carry out the project as quickly as possible, you can use a plow around the perimeter to dig a furrow and plant the saplings in it. Plant all the saplings and shrubbery seeds that you've selected between the trees at once. Then run the plow again right next to that and turn the earth. Before the earth gets trampled, correct and line up each of the saplings."</p><p>"Great! This way, in two or three days, one person can build an entire fence."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Only it's too bad that until that fence grows up it won't serve as a barrier for thieves. And there will be a long wait until it does. Cedars and oaks grow slowly, after all.</p><p>"But the birch and aspens grow quickly, and so will the bushes between them. If you're in a hurry, then you can plant two-meter tree saplings right away. When the birch grows up you can saw it down and use it for your home and the maturing cedars and oaks will take the place of the ones cut down."</p><p>"All right, we can sort out the living fence. I like it a great deal. Now tell me what kind of cottage construction do you see on the land?"</p><p>"Why don't we plan the garden first, Vladimir?"</p><p>"What are you talking about? Different beds for tomatoes, potatoes, and cucumbers? Women usually deal with that. Men build houses. I think one big house should be built right away, a fancy cottage in the European style, so that our descendants and grandchildren remember us well. And another smaller house for the servant. The garden is large, after all. It is going to take a lot of work."</p><p>"Vladimir, if everything is done correctly from the beginning, you will not need a servant. Everything around you will serve you and all your children and grandchildren with the utmost pleasure and love."</p><p>"That doesn't happen for anyone. Even for your beloved summer people. They have five hundred square meters, maybe six, and they work every weekend from dawn till dusk. And here there's a hectare. Just bringing in fertilizer and manure will take at least ten truckloads a year.</p><p>"A lot of manure is going to have to be spread over the plot and then dug into all the earth. Otherwise everything will grow badly. Other fertilizers have to be added, too, and they're sold in special stores. If you don't fertilize, the soil becomes infertile. The agronomists who study the science of the earth know this, and summer people have been convinced based on their own experience. I hope you agree that the land has to be fertilized."</p><p>"Of course, the land has to be fertilized, but there's no need to put yourself out for this. God thought all this through in advance so that the land where you want to live is fertilized and in ideal shape without physical, monotonous effort from you. You only need to touch Him with your thought. Feel the integrity of His system and not make decisions with your mind alone."</p><p>"Then why is the land anywhere now not fertilized according to God's system?"</p><p>"Vladimir, you are in the taiga right now. Look around you. See how tall the trees are and how powerful their trunks. Between the trees are grass and bushes. There are raspberries, currants . . . a great variety of everything grows in the taiga for man. No person in the thousands of years that have passed has ever once fertilized the land in the taiga, but the land remains fertile. Who do you think fertilized it and how?"</p><p>"Who? I don't know who or how. But you have cited a serious fact indeed. Yes, everything does somehow happen with man amazingly. You tell me. Why does the taiga not require all kinds of fertilizers?"</p><p>"God's thought and system have not been violated in the taiga to the same degree as where man lives today. In the taiga, leaves fall from trees, and the breeze tears off little twigs. The land in the taiga is fertilized by leaves and twigs, and worms. The growing grass regulates the earth's composition. Bushes help it get rid of excess acid or alkaline. None of the fertilizers you know can take the place of the leaf that falls from a tree. After all, the leaf bears many of the energies of the cosmos. It has seen the stars, the Sun, and the Moon—not just seen them, but interacted with them. Even after many thousands of years, the taiga land will be fruitful."</p><p>"But there is no taiga on the land where the house is going to be built."</p><p>"Then plan! Plant a forest of different species yourself."</p><p>"Anastasia, why don't you say right off how to make it so that the soil on the plot always fertilizes itself? This is a big deal because there is a lot of other work ahead. Planting the beds, fighting all the different pests. . . ."</p><p>"Of course I can tell you in detail, but it's better if each calls upon his own thought, soul, and dreams for the construction. Each person can sense intuitively what is the most acceptable for him and what will also bring joy to his children and grandchildren. There cannot be a single plan. It is as individual as the great painting of a painter-creator. Each has his own."</p><p>"But you can say approximately, tell us what to do in general."</p><p>"Fine. I'll sketch it out a little. But first you have to understand the main thing. Everything has been created by God for the good of human beings. You are a human being and you can control everything around you. You are a human being! You can understand and feel with your soul where the true earthly paradise lies."</p><p>"But more specifically, without philosophy—tell us where to plant and where to dig something up. What crops should someone plant so he can sell them later for more money?"</p><p>"Vladimir, do you know why peasants and farmers of the present day have no happiness?"</p><p>"No, why?"</p><p>"Many strive for a larger harvest, and then they sell it. They think more about money than the land. They themselves do not believe they can be happy in their family nest. They believe everyone is happy in cities. Believe me, Vladimir, everything that is going on in the soul is always reflected outwardly. Of course, specific outward details are needed, too, so let us picture together approximately the plan for the land. I will merely begin, and you help me."</p><p>"All right, I will. You start."</p><p>"Our plot is a wasteland. The wasteland has been surrounded by a living fence. Let us take up another three quarters or half with forest and plant different kinds of trees in it. At the forest's edge, where the remaining land joins, we will plant living fencing out of the kinds of bushes that animals can't get through to trample the seedlings in the garden. In the forest of living saplings planted closer to each other, we will set up an enclosure where a goat or two, for example, might live later. Also out of the trees, we will set up a shelter for laying hens. In the garden, we will dig a shallow pond of a couple of hundred square meters. We will plant raspberry and currant bushes among the forest trees, and wild strawberries along the edge. Also in the forest, after the trees have grown a little, we will place three empty troughs for bees. We will plant a gazebo of trees, where you and your friends or children can be together, away from the heat, and we will set up a living bedroom, and your creative studio. And a bedroom for the children, and a guest room."</p><p>"That's terrific! That will be a palace then, not a forest."</p><p>"Only it will be a living palace that grows eternally. This is how the Creator Himself thought of everything. Man merely needs to give everything a task. According to his taste, intention, and meaning."</p><p>"Why didn't the Creator do this right away? Everything in the forest grows haphazardly."</p><p>"The forest is like a book for you, the creator. Look more closely, Vladimir. The Father has written everything in it. There, look, three trees are growing just a meter and a half from each other. You are free to plant them in a row and compose all kinds of different configurations out of the many just like them. Bushes between the trees—think about how to use them for your life's delight. But here the trees do not let the grass and bushes grow between them, and you can bear this in mind for your own future living home. You must give everything a program and adjust it to your taste. To cherish and delight you and your children, everything in the vicinity that will be on your land must cherish and nourish.</p><p>"If I'm going to be nourished, I have to plant a garden, and you definitely sweat with a garden."</p><p>"Believe me, Vladimir. A garden can also be made in such a way that it does not require too much labor from you, after all. Here it is only necessary to observe. Between the grasses—the way everything grows in the forest—you could also grow vegetables, the most beautiful tomatoes and cucumbers. You'd find their taste much more pleasant than what you normally eat, and they will bring the organism much more benefit when the land around them is not bare."</p><p>"What about weeds? Won't pests and beetles destroy them?"</p><p>"There is nothing without benefit in nature, and there are no unneeded weeds. Nor are there beetles that harm man."</p><p>"What do you mean there aren't? What about the locust or, for example, the potato beetle, that stinker, which eats the potatoes in the fields."</p><p>"Yes, it does. In this way, it shows people that their ignorance of the Earth's independence is destructive. They are contradicting the intentions of the Divine Creator. How can you plow the same place every year, tormenting the land? It is like picking at an unhealed wound with a rake and at the same time demanding that grace grow from the wounds. The potato beetle or locust will not touch the plot that you and I are drawing. When everything grows in great harmony, then the fruits yielded to their grower are harmonious."</p><p>"But what if in the end, on the plot you have conceived, man doesn't need to fertilize the earth, he doesn't need to fight different pests with poison or spend time weeding, and everything grows there by itself, then what's left for man to do?"</p><p>"Live in paradise. As God wanted it. And he who can build a paradise like that will touch the thought of God and will produce a new creation with Him."</p><p>"What kind of new creation?"</p><p>"The time will come when what came before is created. Let's picture what we have as yet failed to do."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0428>************************ ************************ ************************</br><h2>28. Home</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br></div></p><p> </p><p>"We must also build a sturdy house for our children and grandchildren to live in without problems. A brick house, a two-story cottage with a toilet, bathroom, and water heater—this can be done in any private home now. I was at an exhibition and saw lots of different appliances that have been developed for convenience in private homes. Or are you going to tell me again that we shouldn't use technocratic toys?"</p><p>"On the contrary, you should. If you have the opportunity, you must put in everything to serve the good. In addition, a smooth transition is essential in your habits. However, your grandchildren will not need the house you build. They will understand when they grow up. They will need a different house. This is why it is not worth putting too much effort in building a large house that is too solid."</p><p>"Anastasia, again you've prepared some kind of trick. You reject everything I suggest, even a house. But I think that a house must indisputably be sturdy. You said we would draw the plan together, and you're contradicting me no matter what I say."</p><p>"Of course, together. Vladimir, I am not rejecting anything, after all. I am merely expressing my ideas. Each person can choose for himself what is closer to his ways."</p><p>"You should have said more about your ideas right away. I don't think anyone will be able to understand why the house shouldn't remain for his grandchildren."</p><p>"Their home will preserve a love for you and an eternal memory for others. When your grandchildren grow up, they will definitely understand what material of all the earthly ones conceived would be more pleasant, solid, and healthful for them. Right now, you do not have that kind of material. Your grandchildren will build a wooden house out of the trees that their grandfather planted and their father and mother loved. That house will heal them, protect them from evil spirits, and inspire them to the light. The great energy of Love will live in that house."</p><p>"Yes. . . . Interesting. . . . A house out of the material, the trees, that their grandfather, father, and mother raised. But why will it protect those living in it? There's some kind of mysticism in that."</p><p>"Why do you call the light energy of Love mysticism, Vladimir?"</p><p>"Because I don't understand everything. I'm talking about plans for a house and garden, and all of a sudden you start in about love."</p><p>"But why all of a sudden? Everything needs to be created with love from the beginning."</p><p>"What—even the fence? And the forest saplings need to be planted with love, too?"</p><p>"Naturally. The great energy of Love and all the planets of the Universe will help you live the full life intrinsic to the son of God."</p><p>"Well, now you are being completely incomprehensible, Anastasia. You've gone from a house and garden to God again. What connection could there be here?"</p><p>"Forgive me, Vladimir, for the incomprehensibility of my explanations. I will try to speak a little differently about the significance of our project."</p><p>"Try away. Only it will be yours, not ours."</p><p>"It is universal, Vladimir. Many human souls sense it intuitively. The current dogmas and noise of the technocratic path and science do not let man make it specific, make sense of them, and many sciences are trying to lead people away from happiness."</p><p>"Why don't you try to set it all out more specifically?"</p><p>"Yes, I will. Oh, how I want people to understand! Oh, logic of Divine aspirations, help me to build clear phrases!"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0429>************************ ************************ ************************</br><h2>29. The Energy of Love</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br></div></p><p> </p><p>"It, the great energy of Love, was sent to Earth by God for His children and comes to each one day. Sometimes, and more than once, it strives to warm man and remain with him forever. But most people are not given the opportunity to have the great Divine energy remain with them.</p><p>"Imagine, a man and woman meet one day in the radiance of beautiful love. They strive to join their lives forever. They believe their union will be solid, bound on paper and through ritual in front of many witnesses. But they hope in vain. Only a few days pass and the energy of Love abandons them. It is like this for almost everyone."</p><p>"Yes, you are right, Anastasia. An enormous number of people divorce—seventy percent. And those who don't divorce sometimes live like cat and dog or become indifferent to each other. Everyone knows this. But why does this occur so widely? No one understands. You say the energy of Love abandons them, but why? Is it as if it were taunting everyone to play some kind of game."</p><p>"Love does not taunt anyone or play games. It strives to live eternally with everyone, but man chooses his way of life himself, and that way of life frightens the energy of Love. Love cannot give inspiration to destruction. It does not befit the fruit of Love to live in agony when two people begin to build a life together, when they strive to settle in a little apartment more like a lifeless stone crypt, when each has his own work and interests, his own circle, with no common causes for the future, no joint aspiration. Their bodies merely enjoy their pleasure in order to give the world their child to tear to pieces, a world of no pure water, of criminals, wars, and disease. The energy of Love moves away from this."</p><p>"But what if the couple has a lot of money, or if their parents give the newlyweds not a small apartment but a six-room one, in a building with a modern new layout, a doorman, a good car, and a lot of money in the newlyweds' bank account? Would the energy of Love agree to live in those conditions? Could he and she live to old age in love?"</p><p>"They would have to live to old age in fear, without freedom or love, and watch everything around them age and rot."</p><p>"So what does this rather fastidious energy of Love need?"</p><p>"Love is neither fastidious nor obstinate. It strives for Divine creation. It can warm for eternity those who agree to create a dimension of Love with it."</p><p>"Does the project you're drawing have a dimension of Love somewhere?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Where is it?"</p><p>"In everything. At first, it is born for the two of them, and then for their children. The children will have a connection with the entire Universe across three planes of being.</p><p>"Imagine, Vladimir. He and she will begin in love to carry out the project we are drawing, planting their own trees, grass, and garden and rejoicing as their creations bloom in spring. Love will live between them, in their hearts, and around them for eternity. Each will present the other with a spring flower, recalling how they planted the tree that has blossomed together. The taste of raspberry will remind them of the taste of love. He and she will touch each other in love with a raspberry branch.</p><p>"Beautiful fruits will ripen in their shady garden, but the two planted the garden together. They planted the garden in love.</p><p>"She laughed ringingly when he sweated digging a hole, and she snatched up the drops from his brow and kissed his hot lips.</p><p>"Often it happens in life that only one loves. The other only allows him or her to be near. As soon as they begin to make their garden, the energy of Love is shared and never abandons the two! After all, their way of life will correspond to the one in which they themselves can live in love and go on to pass the dimension of Love on to their children. They can raise children in their image and likeness, together with God."</p><p>"Anastasia, tell me in more detail about raising children. Many readers ask me about childrearing. If you don't have your own system, then at least say which of the present-day ones is best."</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0430>************************ ************************ ************************</br><h2>30. In the Image and Likeness</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br></div></p><p> </p><p>"A single childrearing system will not suit everyone, Vladimir, if only because each must first ask himself the question of whom he aspires to raise in his child."</p><p>"What do you mean? A human being, of course, happy and smart."</p><p>"If that's so, then you yourself first have to become that. If you can't be happy yourself, then you have to know what kept you from happiness.</p><p>"I very much want to talk about happy children. Their education, Vladimir, is the education of the self. The project we are drawing together will help this. You know, everyone knows how children are being born now. People undervalue what precedes birth, and many children are not given the planes of being inherent to man alone. In this way, parents deliberately give birth to cripples."</p><p>"Cripples? Are you talking about no arms or legs, or suffering from polio?"</p><p>"A person born can be crippled in ways other than outwardly. The flesh may even appear normal outwardly. But a person has a second self, and the full set of all energies must be in each—intellect, emotions, thought, and much else. But your medicine now considers more than half of all children deficient, even by modern, greatly reduced parameters. When you decide to convince yourself of this, find out how many schools are now open for retarded children. This is what your medicine calls them, but doctors only compare a child's abilities with those of what they consider relatively normal children. However, if doctors could see what comprised the mind and inner set of human energies in the ideal, then the normal children out of all those born on Earth could be counted on your fingers."</p><p>"But why are all children born not quite full-fledged, as you say?"</p><p>"The technocratic culture does not want the three main points in newborns to merge into one. Technocracy strives to break the threads in the Divine intellect. The threads break before the child's birth. Man seeks but does not find this connection later and undergoes many trials through the world."</p><p>"What main points? What threads to the intellect? I didn’t understand anything."</p><p>"Vladimir, a human being takes shape largely before appearing in the world, after all. His upbringing should touch the cosmos's entire creation. God's son should not disregard that which He used in making His beautiful creations. Parents should present the three main points, the three first planes of being, to their creation.</p><p>"Here is the first point of a person's birth; it is called parental thought. Both the Bible and the Quran talk about this: 'In the beginning there was the word.' But it can also be said more precisely: 'In the beginning there was thought.' Let he who is called parent now remember when and how he contemplated his own offspring in his thoughts. What did he predict for him? What kind of world did he create for his creation?"</p><p>"Anastasia, I don't think most strive to think before the point when the woman gets pregnant. People just sleep together, sometimes without even getting married. They marry when the girlfriend gets pregnant, since it's unclear whether she's going to get pregnant at all. It makes no sense to think in advance when it's unclear there's going to be a child at all."</p><p>"Yes, unfortunately, that is how it happens. Most people are conceived in fleshly pleasures. But man, God's image and likeness, should not appear in the world as a consequence of pleasures. Imagine a different situation. He and she, in love for each other, and in their thoughts about their future creation, build a beautiful, living home. They picture how their son or daughter will be happy in this place, how their offspring will hear his first sound: his mother's breathing and the birds singing, God's creations. Then they picture how their grown child will want to rest after a hard journey and will come to his parents' garden and sit down under a cedar's canopy. Under the canopy of a tree planted on their homeland by his parents' hand in love of and with thoughts of him. The planting of a native tree by his future parents defines the first point, and that point will call on the planets to help them for their future creation. It is needed! It is important! And it is inherent in God most of all! It confirms the fact that you are going to create the likeness of Him, the Great Creator! And He will rejoice at the intelligence of His son and His daughter. 'Thought serves as the beginning of all.' Believe me, please, Vladimir. Streams of all the energies of the cosmos will find that point where the thought of the two merge, in love, where the two think about their beautiful creation.</p><p>"The second point—or rather, yet another human plane is born, and a new star lights up in the sky—is when in love, and in thoughts of creating beauty, two bodies merge into one in the place where you are building a paradise, a living home for your future child.</p><p>"Later, the pregnant mother should live in that spot for nine months. Things turn out even better if those months are the flowering of spring, the fragrance of summer, and the fruits of fall. Where nothing distracts her but delights and pleasant sensations. Where only the sounds of Divine creations surround the wife in whom the beautiful creation already lives and senses the entire Universe. The future mother must see the stars and give all the stars and all the planets mentally to him, her beautiful child. The mother can do all this easily. This will all be in her power. Everything will follow the mother's thought without delay. The cosmos will be the loyal servant to the two people's beautiful creation in love.</p><p>"And a third point, a new plane should come about in the same place. The birth should take place where the child was conceived. The father should be by the mother's side. The great Father who loves us all will raise a crown over the three."</p><p>"That's terrific! I don't know why, but your words take my breath away, Anastasia. You know, I imagined the place you were talking about. Oh, how I imagined it! I wished I myself could be born anew in that place. That I could go there right now and rest in a beautiful garden planted by my father and mother, sit under a shady tree they planted for me before my birth—where I was conceived and where I was born, where my mother walked in the garden thinking about me, who had yet to appear in the world."</p><p>"That place would have greeted you with great joy, Vladimir. If your flesh is ill, it would heal your flesh. If your soul, then it would heal your soul. It would give food and drink if you were weary. It would wrap you in peaceful sleep and wake you with a joyous dawn. But like many people living on the earth today, you have no place like that. You have no homeland where the planes of being can collect into one."</p><p>"But why does it all come out so awkwardly for us? Why do mothers continue to give birth to semi-retarded children? Who took this place away from me? Who took it away from others?"</p><p>"Vladimir, maybe you yourself can answer, you who failed to create this place for your daughter, Polina."</p><p>"Are you implying I'm to blame because . . . my daughter doesn't have that?"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0431>************************ ************************ ************************</br><h2>31. Who is to Blame?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br></div></p><p> </p><p>"But I didn't know that you could do something so wonderful. It's too bad life can't be turned back and all fixed."</p><p>"Why turn it back? Life goes on, and each person can create a beautiful image of life at any moment."</p><p>"Life does go on, of course. But what's the use, for instance, for old people? Now they expect their children to help them, while the children themselves sit around unemployed. Not only that, but how can one raise children already grown?"</p><p>"Even grown children can be given a Divine education."</p><p>"But how?"</p><p>"You know, it would be good for old people to apologize to their children. Apologize sincerely for the fact that they were not able to give them a world without misfortune, for the dirty water and murky air.</p><p>"Let aging hands begin to build a real, living house for the grown children. The days of the old peoples' lives will be extended as soon as this thought is born in them. When old people touch their homeland with their own hand, believe me, Vladimir, their children will return to them. Even if the old people cannot finish building the house, their children will bury them in their homeland and thereby help them be reborn once again."</p><p>"Buried in their homeland? But you consider a parcel of one's own land a homeland. You mean we should bury our parents on this land and not at a cemetery? And put a headstone there for them?"</p><p>"Naturally, on the land. In the little forest planted by their hand. But they do not need man-made monuments. After all, everything around will serve as a memory of them, Your surroundings can remind you of them every day, not with sorrow but with joy. And your family will become immortal. After all, only a good memory brings souls back to Earth."</p><p>"Wait, wait up. And the cemeteries? You mean we don't need them at all?"</p><p>"Vladimir, the cemeteries of today resemble latrines where people discard what they don't need. Even in quite recent times, the bodies of the dead were buried in family crypts, in chapels, in temples. Only those strays or those without kith and kin were taken outside the settlements. All that remains is a distorted ritual from distant times to remember the dead. Three days later, then nine days later, half a year, a year, and then . . . Then tribute is paid only to the ritual. Today, people gradually consign the dead soul to oblivion. Frequently they even forget the living, as children even abandon their parents and run away from them for a distant land. This is not the children's fault. They run, intuitively sensing the parental lie and the despair of their own aspirations. They run from despair, and they themselves fall into the same impasse.</p><p>"Everything in the Universe is set up so that the souls who evoke good memories from the Earth are physically re-embodied first, not through ritual, but from sincere feelings. They appear in those living on earth when the person who has died leaves behind pleasant memories about themselves because of how they lived. When the memories of them do not arise from ritual but are valid and material.</p><p>"Among people's many other universal planes of being, the human material plane has no less significance, and the attitude toward it should be protective.</p><p>"From the bodies of parents buried in the forest, which was planted by their hand, grass will come up, and so will flowers, trees, and bushes. You will see and take pleasure in them. You will touch the piece of homeland cultivated by your parent's hand every day, you will communicate with them subconsciously, and they with you. Have you heard of guardian angels?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Those guardian angels, your ancestors and parents, will try to protect you. Three generations later, their souls will be embodied once again on Earth. But when they are not in earthly matter, the energies of their souls will keep you under their protection every moment, like guardian angels. No hostile invader will be able to enter your native parcel of land. There is the energy of fear in each person. This energy will be heightened in an aggressor. Many illnesses are born in an aggressor, illnesses that come from stress. Those illnesses will subsequently destroy him."</p><p>"Subsequently. But before then, he can be up to lots of dirty tricks."</p><p>"Who is going to want to attack, Vladimir, if he knows that punishment is inevitable?"</p><p>"What if he doesn't know?"</p><p>"Intuitively, each person knows that now."</p><p>"Oh, all right, let's say you're right about aggressors, but what about friends? For instance, I decide I want to invite my friends to visit. They come but they frighten everything around them."</p><p>"Your surroundings will be glad to see your friends, whose intentions are pure, as will you. Here you can bring in a little dog for an example. When a friend comes to see a dog's owners, the faithful guard does not touch him. When an aggressor attacks, the loyal dog is prepared to enter into a fight to the death with the aggressor.</p><p>"In your native parcel of land, each blade of grass will be healing both for you and for your friends. The gust of wind will bring you healing pollen from the flowers, trees, and bushes. You will have the energies of all your ancestors with you. Anticipating creation, the planets will await your instructions.</p><p>"The gaze of your beloved will be reflected from the petal of each beautiful flower for centuries to come. The children you have raised will speak gently with you over millennia, and you will be embodied in new generations. You will speak with yourself, and you will educate yourself. You will create a creation with your Parent. In your homeland, in your dimension of Love, a Divine energy will live—love!"</p><p>When Anastasia in the taiga talked about the land, her intonations and her enthusiasm took my breath away. Later, after I had left and written these lines, I often thought, "Is it really so important for each person to have this? This piece of his own homeland, as she calls it? Can a child who is already grown really be raised with your last breath? Can you really speak to your parents with the help of his native parcel of land and will their energies protect you, both soul and body?" As it happened, life itself accidentally dispelled all my doubts. This is how it happened.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0432>************************ ************************ ************************</br><h2>32. The Old Man at the Dolmen</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br></div></p><img src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/old-man-at-the-dolmen-vk.com-kumar82.jpg><p> </p><p>Three years ago, when I arrived in the North Caucasus, I wrote the first chapters about the dolmens, to which a continuous stream of people have now flooded. At the time, however, hardly anyone even looked in on these ancient ancestral sites. I alone often went to the dolmen located on the land of a farmer, Bambakov, in the village of Pshada in the Gelendzhik District. Each time, old man Bambakov would suddenly appear near the dolmen. He always seemed to appear unexpectedly, wearing a patched shirt and holding a tin of honey from his apiary.</p><p>The old man was tall, lean, and very lively. He had acquired the land recently, at the beginning of perestroika, and one got the impression that he had been in a great hurry to set everything up on it. He had erected a small house, an overhang for beehives, and sheds made of various discarded material. He had begun to lay a garden and dig a small pond, believing that a spring would flow where he dug, but he had hit rock.</p><p>Old man Bambakov was also very protective toward the dolmen. He swept around it, placed pebbles from the field next to it, and said, "These stones have been brought here by people's hands. You see? They don't look like those around here. People made a barrow out of them and raised a dolmen on it."</p><p>The old man's farm was off to the side of the village and road. Usually, he worked on it alone. I thought, "Does he realize how senseless his efforts are? He can't keep up a farm, cultivate the land, or build a normal, modern house. But if there were a miracle and he were able to improve the surrounding territory and set up his farm, then he would scarcely have cause to rejoice. Everyone's children are rushing to the cities. Even the old man's son had set himself up in Moscow with a wife and become an official.</p><p>"Doesn't the old man realize how senseless his efforts are? No one needs them, not even his children. With what heart will he have to die, knowing that desolation awaits his farm, knowing that weeds will overtake everything and that his bees will swarm? The dolmen standing awkwardly in the middle of his field will once again be strewn with trash. Better he rest in his old age, but from morning to night he's always digging and building like a wind-up toy."</p><p>One day I arrived at the dolmen when it was already getting dark. The moon lit the path leading to it. Silence all around, only the rustle of leaves in the breeze. I stopped a few steps away from the trees that grow around the dolmen.</p><p>The old man was sitting on a stone next to the dolmen's portal. I immediately recognized his lean figure. Usually lively and cheerful, the old man was sitting perfectly still, and it seemed to me he was crying. Then he stood up and with his quick step paced back and forth by the dolmen's portal, stopping abruptly, turning to face the dolmen, and waving his arm affirmatively. I realized that old man Bambakov was communicating with the dolmen, talking to it.</p><p>I turned and started toward the village, trying to tread as lightly as I could. On my way I thought, "So how can a dolmen, its spirit, help this man who is living out his final days, no matter how strong and wise he is? How? Only with this kind of communication? Wisdom! Youth needs wisdom. What is old age going to do with it? Who needs it? Who is going to listen to wise speeches if even his children are who knows how far away?"</p><p>A year and a half later, on another visit to Gelendzhik, I headed once again for the dolmen that was on old man Bambakov's land. I already knew that Stanislav Bambakov had died. And I was a little sad that I wouldn't see this cheerful, purposeful person again. I wouldn't taste any more honey from his apiary. Mainly, I didn't feel like seeing trash near the dolmen and desolation around it.</p><p>But the path leading from the highway to his land was swept clean. At the turn onto the path toward the dolmen, among the trees, there were wooden tables with benches near them and a handsome gazebo. The path had been lined with neatly whitewashed stones and green cypress saplings. A light was burning in the windows of the little house and next to it, on a pole.</p><p>His son! Old man Bambakov's son Sergei Stanislavovich Bambakov had left Moscow and his job and settled with his wife and son on his father's farm.</p><p>Sergei and I sat at the table under the trees.</p><p>"My father called me in Moscow and asked me to come. I came, I looked, and I brought my family," Sergei said. "I worked here with my father, too. The work with him brought me joy. When he died, I couldn't leave this place."</p><p>"You don't regret moving from the capital?"</p><p>"No, I don't, and neither does my wife. I thank my father every day. We are a lot more comfortable here."</p><p>"Have you put in conveniences, brought water into the house?"</p><p>"Yes, and my father had put the toilet in there by the house. I have another comfort in mind. Inside, it feels more comfortable, more complete."</p><p>"How is your work going?"</p><p>"There is plenty of work here. I have to start a garden and figure out the apiary. I still don't quite know how to deal with bees. It's too bad I didn't have time to pick up the skill from my father. People are visiting the dolmen more and more. We greet buses every day, and my wife is happy to help. My father asked me to welcome people, and I do. I set up this stop and want to bring in water. But the taxes are killing me. Right now I don't have the funds. It's also good that the administration chief helps out a little."</p><p>I told Sergei what Anastasia had said about the land, gardens, and parents' memory, and he replied, "You know, she's right! One hundred percent right. My father died, and it's like I'm talking to him every day, sometimes arguing. He gets closer and closer to me, as if he hadn't died at all."</p><p>"How's that? How can you talk to him? Like channelers? You hear his voice?"</p><p>"Well, no. It's all much simpler. See that trough? He was searching for water and hit the chalk rock. I wanted to fill up this trough and in its place put up one more table with benches. I thought to myself: "What were you doing, father, miscalculating? Now there's extra work and so much to do anyway." Only the rain started, the water flowed downhill, and the trough filled with water and held and the water stayed in the trough for months. A small pond formed. I thought, "Wonderful, father, your trough came in handy." There were a lot of other things he thought of, and I'm trying to understand them."</p><p>"How did he tear you away from Moscow, Sergei? What words did he use?"</p><p>"He just told me everything. Ordinary words. All I remember is these new feelings appearing from his words, desires, and here I am. Thank you, father."</p><p>What words did old Bambakov learn communicating with the dolmen? What wisdom did he learn so that he was able to bring his own son back and bring him back for good! It's too bad Bambakov was buried in the cemetery and not on his land, as Anastasia had said. I also admired and envied Sergei. His father had found or created a piece of homeland for him. Would I ever have this? Would others? It was good in Anastasia's glade and good at Bambakov's. It would be good for everyone to have his own piece of homeland!</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0433>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>33. School, or Lesson of the Gods</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************</br></div></p><p> </p><p>After my last visit to the dolmen on Bambakov's land and my conversation with his son, my discussion with Anastasia about homeland and her project for a plot of land kept coming to mind more and more vividly. The separate parcels of future beautiful settlements that Anastasia drew in the dirt with a stick surfaced in my memory, the enthusiasm of her voice, filled with unusual intonations, when she talked about them. It was as if I could hear the rustling of the leaves in the gardens that had covered the wastelands and the pure water gurgling in the streams, could see the handsome and happy men and women living in their midst and hear the children's laughter and the songs at the close of day. Meanwhile, many questions arose because it was so unusual.</p><p>"Anastasia, why do you draw it as if the parcels of land did not touch each other?"</p><p>
"That is as it should be, so that there are lanes, paths and roads, in the beautiful settlement. On every side, from each parcel to the next, there should be a distance of at least three meters."</p><p>"Will the settlement have a school?"</p><p>"Naturally. Look, here's the school—in the middle of all the little squares."</p><p>"It would be interesting to see what kind of teachers the new school will have and how the lessons will be set up. Probably the same way as I saw at the Shchetinin school. Now lots of people go there. Everyone likes the forest school, which is in Tekos. Many people want to create a school just like it near them."</p><p>"The Shchetinin school is beautiful. It is a step toward the school in which children will study in the new settlements. Shchetinin graduates will help build them and will teach in them. But the main thing is not just educated and wise pedagogues. The parents will teach their children in those new schools and will themselves learn from their children."</p><p>"But how can parents all suddenly become teachers? Do all parents really have a higher education, and a specialized one at that? The different subjects—mathematics, physics, chemistry, literature—who is going to explain to the children in the school?"</p><p>"Not everyone will have an identical education, of course. But knowing subjects and sciences does not have to be an end in itself, after all. How to be happy is the main thing to learn, and that only parents can show by their own example.</p><p>"It is not at all mandatory that parents conduct a school lesson in the traditional sense. For example, parents can participate in a joint discussion or can give an exam collectively."</p><p>"An exam? Who can parents give an exam to?"</p><p>"Their own children, and the children can test them, their own parents."</p><p>"Parents give their children an exam? That's just ridiculous. Then all the children will get top marks. What parent would give his own child a bad mark? Of course any parent would give his son or daughter a top mark."</p><p>"Vladimir, do not be hasty in your conclusions. Among the lessons similar to present-day school lessons, there will be others, the main ones, the lessons of the new school."</p><p>"Others? What kind?"</p><p>Suddenly, the solution came to me. If Anastasia could show me pictures from a thousand years ago so easily (it didn't matter how she did it, using her ray, hypnosis, or something else; it worked), that meant . . . that meant she could show the near future, too.</p><p>So I asked, "Anastasia, can you show me just one lesson in that future school that the new settlements will have? Can you show me a nontraditional lesson?"</p><p>"I can."</p><p>"Then show me. I want to compare them with what I saw at the Shchetinin school and with those I myself had in school."</p><p>"You won't ask questions about or be frightened by the power I use to create a picture of the future?"</p><p>"I don't care how you do it. I'm very curious to see."</p><p>"Then lie down on the grass, relax, and go to sleep."</p><p>Anastasia quietly placed her palm on mine and . . .</p><p>I saw, as if looking down, among many parcels of land, one that was different from all the others in its inner layout. In it there were several large wooden buildings connected by paths lined with different flowerbeds. Next to the set of structures was a natural amphitheater: a knoll where rows of benches descended from top to bottom in a semi-circle and where about three hundred people of different ages were sitting. Among them were older people with gray in their hair and people who were quite young. They seemed to be sitting in families, since grown men, women, and children of different ages sat higgledy-piggledy. Everyone was talking to everyone else excitedly, as if they were about to see something unusual—a superstar concert, or a presidential speech.</p><p>On a wooden stage up front were two little tables, two chairs, and a large blackboard in back. Next to the platform was a group of children, fifteen or so, ranging in age from five to twelve and engaged in lively debate about something.</p><p>"There is something like a symposium on astronomy about to begin," I heard Anastasia's voice.</p><p>"Why are the children here? Didn't their parents have anyone to leave them with?" I asked Anastasia.</p><p>"One of them from the group of debating children is just about to give the main report. They're still choosing who this will be. See, there are two candidates: a boy, nine years old, and a girl of eight. Now the children are voting. The majority chose the boy."</p><p>A businesslike little boy approached the table with a confident step. He took some papers with plans and drawings out of a manila folder and laid them on the table. All the children either gradually walked or skipped along to join their parents sitting on the benches. The red-haired, freckle-faced little girl—the other candidate for the speech—walked past the table with a proudly raised head. She was holding a bigger and thicker folder than the boy. There were probably drawings and plans in that folder, too.</p><p>The boy by the table tried to say something to the girl candidate walking by, but the child didn't stop. She straightened her red braid and walked past, turning away demonstratively. For a while the boy watched, distraught, as the proud red-haired child moved away. Then he again began to set out his pages with great concentration.</p><p>"Who taught these children astronomy so well that they can give a report to adults?" I asked Anastasia.</p><p>"No one taught them," she replied. "It was suggested to them that they themselves figure out how it is all arranged and then prepare and present their conclusions. They have been preparing for more than two weeks, and now the important moment has come. Their conclusions can be opposed by anyone who wants to, and they will defend their opinion."</p><p>"So this is like a game?"</p><p>"You could call what is going on a game, but it is a very serious game. Each person present will engage and accelerate his thought about the planetary arrangement and perhaps will begin to think about something bigger. After all, the children have been thinking for two weeks, contemplating, and their thinking is not limited by any dogmas. They do not have any preset interpretations of the planetary arrangement hanging over them. We still do not know what they will come out with."</p><p>"Do you mean to say they will dream up something with their childish intellect?"</p><p>"I mean to say they will present their theory. The adults do not have axioms of the planetary arrangement either, after all. The goal of this symposium is not to work out any canons but to accelerate thought, which subsequently will determine the truth or come close to it."</p><p>A young man walked up to the second little table and announced the beginning of the report. The boy began to speak.</p><p>He spoke confidently and enthusiastically for twenty-five or thirty minutes. His speech seemed to me total childish fantasy. A fantasy not based on any scientific theories or even the elementary knowledge of a high school astronomy course. The boy said approximately the following.</p><p>"If you look at the sky at night, there are a whole lot of stars shining there. There are different kinds of stars. There are very little stars and bigger ones. But the very little stars can be big, too. We only think they're little at first. But they are very big. Because when an airplane flies high up, it's little, but when we go up to it on the ground, it looks big, and lots of people can fit inside it. Each star could fit a lot of people. Only there aren't any people on stars right now. But they shine at night. The big ones shine and so do the little ones. They shine so that we will look at them and think about them. The stars want us to do everything as well on them as on Earth. They envy the Earth a little. They want the same kinds of berries and trees to grow on them as we have and to have the same kind of streams and little fish. The stars are waiting for us, and each is trying to shine so that we notice it. But we still can't fly to them because we have a lot to do at home. But when we've finished up everything at home and everywhere and things are fine all over the Earth, we'll fly to the stars. Only we won't fly on a plane or rocket, because it takes a long time to fly on a plane, and it's long and boring on a rocket. Also, not everyone will fit on a plane or rocket, and rockets won't hold all kinds of freight. And trees won't fit, or a stream. When we've made everything all over the Earth good, we, the whole Earth, will fly to the first star. A few other stars will want to fly to Earth themselves and press up to it. They've already sent us little bits, and their little bits have pressed up to the Earth. At first, people thought these were comets, but these are bits of stars that wanted very much to press up to the beautiful Earth. They were sent by the stars that are waiting for us. We can fly up to a distant star as the whole Earth, and whoever wants to can stay on the star, so that it would be handsome there, like on Earth.</p><p>The boy lifted his pages and showed them to his listeners. On the pages were drawings of the starry sky and trajectories of the Earth's movement toward the stars. In the last drawing, two stars bloomed in gardens and Earth moved away from them in its intergalactic flight.</p><p>When the boy finished speaking and showing his drawings, the moderator announced that whoever wanted to could speak as an opponent or express his own ideas regarding what he had heard. But no one was in any hurry to speak. Everyone was silent and, it seemed to me, agitated for some reason.</p><p>"Why are they so agitated?" I asked Anastasia. "Do none of the adults know astronomy?"</p><p>"They're agitated because you need to bring good arguments and speak coherently. After all, their children are present. If a speech is incomprehensible or unacceptable to a child's soul, mistrust will arise toward the speaker or, even worse, dislike. The adults treasure the regard for them and are agitated and don't want to take a risk. They're afraid of looking mean in front of those gathered and most of all in front of their own children."</p><p>The heads of many of those present began turning in the direction of an elderly, graying man sitting in the middle of the hall. He had his arms around the shoulders of the little red-headed girl, the one who was one of the candidates for the report. Next to them sat a young and very pretty woman. Anastasia commented.</p><p>"Many are now looking at the graying man in the middle of the hall. He is a university professor. A scientist. He is retired now. At first, his private life didn't work out, and he had no children. Ten years ago he took a parcel of land and began setting it up himself. A young woman came to love him and they had this little red-haired girl. The young woman next to him is his wife and the mother of his daughter. The former professor loves his late child very much, and the red-haired girl, his daughter, regards him with great respect and love. Many of those present believe that the professor should speak first.</p><p>But the graying professor was slow to speak. It was obvious he was drumming a magazine out of agitation. Finally the professor rose and began to say something about the structure of the Universe, comets, and the Earth's mass.</p><p>Finally, he concluded, "The planet Earth, of course, does move in space and rotates. But it is indissolubly linked with the solar system and cannot move toward distant galaxies independently without its solar system. The Sun gives life to every living thing on Earth. Moving away from the Sun would mean a significant cooling on Earth and, as a consequence, the planet's death. We can all observe what happens even when we move a relatively short way from the Sun. Winter happens. . . ."</p><p>The professor suddenly fell silent. The boy speaker was going through his drawings, distraught, then looking inquiringly at his classmates with whom he had prepared his speech. But evidently the argument about winter and cooling was very weighty and understandable to everyone. This argument destroyed the pretty childish dream of common flight. Suddenly, in the silence that followed, which had already lasted half a minute, the graying professor's voice was heard again.</p><p>"Winter. . . . Life always dies down if the Earth does not have enough solar energy. Always! No scientific theoretical investigations are needed to see this . . . to be convinced. However, it may be that the Earth itself has the same kind of energy as the Sun, but it just hasn't shown itself. No one has discovered it yet. Maybe you will one day. Maybe the Earth can be self-sufficient. This energy will manifest itself in something. The Sun's energy will manifest on Earth and like solar energy, it will unfold the flowers' petals. And then we can travel on Earth through the galaxy. But then—"</p><p>The professor broke off and fell silent. A murmur of dissatisfaction arose in the hall. And it began. . . .</p><p>Adults rose from their seats to refute the professor when it came to the possibility of living without the Sun. They said something about plant photosynthesis, about the temperature of the environment, about the trajectories of the movement of the planets, which no one planet can exit. The professor sat, dropping his graying head lower and lower. His red-headed daughter turned her head to face each speaker and sometimes rose slightly, as if she wanted to defend her father from his opponents with her body.</p><p>An elderly woman who looked like a teacher took the floor and began talking about how bad it is to indulge and flatter children for the sake of their self-esteem.</p><p>"Any lie will be exposed in time, and then how are we all going to look? This is not simply a lie, it is cowardice," the woman said.</p><p>The red-haired girl latched onto the lapels of her father's jacket. She began shaking him, nearly crying, repeating in a breaking voice, "Papochka, you lied about energy. Did you lie, Papochka? Because we're children? The lady said you were being cowardly. Is being cowardly a bad thing?"</p><p>Silence fell in the open-air hall. The professor lifted his head, looked into his daughters eyes, put his hand on her little shoulder, and said softly, "I believed what I said, my daughter."</p><p>The red-haired child fell silent again. Then she quickly climbed up on the seat and her high child's voice shouted to the hall, "My papa is not cowardly. My father believed it! He believed it!"</p><p>The little girl sent her gaze around the now quiet hall. No one looked in their direction. She turned toward her mother. But the young woman had turned away and lowered her head, buttoning and unbuttoning the buttons on her jacket sleeve. The little girl again sent her gaze around the silent hall and turned to her father. The professor continued as before to look helplessly at his little daughter. The red-haired girl's voice was heard again in the absolute silence, but now it was kind and not loud.</p><p>"The people don't believe you, Papochka. They don't believe it because an energy still hasn't appeared on Earth that could open the flowers' petals like the nice Sun. But when it does appear, all the people will believe you. When it appears, they will believe you."</p><p>She straightened her bangs with a quick movement, jumped into the aisle, and ran off. When she reached the edge of the open-air hall she headed for one of the nearby houses, ran in the door, and a couple of seconds later appeared in the doorway again. She was holding a pot with some kind of plant in it. She ran with it to the now empty table for the speaker. She put the potted plant on the table, and her child's voice, loud and confident, was heard over the heads of those present.</p><p>"Here is a flower. It has closed its petals. The petals of all the flowers have closed, because there is no Sun. But they will open soon. Because there is energy on the Earth. . . . I . . . I am going to turn into energy that will open the flowers' petals."</p><p>The red-haired girl squeezed her little fingers into fists and began looking at the flower without blinking.</p><p>The people sitting in their seats did not talk. Everyone was watching the little girl and the potted plant on the table in front of her.</p><p>The professor slowly rose from his seat and walked toward his daughter. He walked up to her and took her by the shoulders, trying to lead her away. But the redhead jerked her shoulders and whispered, "Why don't you help me, Papochka?"</p><p>The professor must have been completely distraught. He remained standing next to his daughter, his hands on her childish shoulders, and he began looking at the flower, too.</p><p>Nothing was happening to the flower. I felt sorry for the red-haired girl and the graying professor. Why did he have to go babbling on with his statements about his belief in an undiscovered energy?</p><p>All of a sudden, the boy who had given the report stood up in the first row. He turned halfway to the hall sitting silently, sniffed, and walked toward the table. He approached the table with dignity and confidence and stood next to the red-haired girl. He too directed his stare at the plant in the clay pot. But of course, as before, nothing was happening to the plant.</p><p>And then I saw it! I saw children of different ages start standing up from their seats in the hall. One after another, the children walked toward the table. They stood side by side in silence and looked closely at the flower. Last was a girl of about six bringing along her very little brother, holding him with her two little hands. They squeezed in front of those standing there, with difficulty, and with someone's help she stood her little brother on the chair in front of the table. The little guy, gazing around at those standing there, turned toward the flower and started blowing on it.</p><p>All of a sudden, the petals of one of the flowers on the plant in the pot began slowly opening. Very slowly. But the quieted people in the hall noticed it. Some of them rose silently from their seats. A second flower on the table opened its petals, and along with it a third and a fourth.</p><p>"Eee!" the elderly woman who looked like a teacher exclaimed in an ecstatic child's voice, and she began to clap. The hall broke out in applause. The handsome young woman who was the professor's wife ran from the hall toward the professor, who had stepped aside from the exultant children by the flower and was wiping his temple. She flung her arms around his neck and began kissing his cheeks and lips.</p><p>The red-haired girl took a step toward her kissing parents, but the little boy reporter held her back. She jerked her arm away, but after taking a few steps she turned around, went right up to him, rebuttoned the unbuttoned button on his shirt, smiled, and turning quickly, ran to her hugging parents.</p><p>More and more people from the hall came up to the table. Some picked up their children. Some shook the young speaker's hand. He stood there, holding out his hand for shaking, and with his second hand pressed the button just buttoned by the red-haired girl.</p><p>Someone started playing something halfway between a Russian and Gypsy song on the bayan. An old man started tapping his foot on the stage, and a stoutish woman walked out to him like a plump swan. Two young fellows began a rollicking squatting dance, and the flower with its opened petals turned toward the rollicking Russian dance, which was drawing more and more people with its daring.</p><p>The picture of the unusual school quickly vanished, as if the screen had gone black. I was sitting on the grass. Around me was the taiga vegetation, and Anastasia was by my side. But inside me was an agitation. I heard the laughter of the happy people, and the sounds of the merry dance's music, and I didn't want to say goodbye to all that.</p><p>When what I heard inside me gradually fell still, I said to Anastasia, "What you just showed me doesn't look anything like a school lesson. This is a gathering of families living as neighbors. There wasn't a single teacher. It all happened of its own accord."</p><p>"There was a teacher, Vladimir. The wisest one was there. That teacher did not distract anyone."</p><p>"But why were the parents present? Their emotions caused anxiety."</p><p>"Emotions and feelings accelerate thought multifold. These kinds of lessons take place every week in this school. Teachers and parents are united in their aspirations, and they consider the children equals among them."</p><p>"But it still seems fairly unusual to have parents' participation in teaching children. After all, parents have not studied to be teachers."</p><p>"Vladimir, it is a sad fact that is now considered normal for people to hand their children over to others for education. Who to doesn't matter—a school or some other institution. They hand over their children, often without even knowing what kind of worldview is being taught, what is being instilled in them, what destiny is being prepared for them. Whoever gives his own children up to the unknown deprives himself of his own children. This is why those children whose mothers give them up to someone else for teaching forget their mothers.</p><p>* * *</p><p>It came time to return. The information I'd obtained filled me up so much that I didn't even notice what was going on around me. I said goodbye to Anastasia rather quickly.</p><p>"Don't see me back," I said. "I don't want anyone to interrupt my thinking while I’m walking alone."</p><p>"Yes, no one should interrupt your thinking," she replied. "When you reach the river, my grandfather will be there, and he will help take you across to the dock in his boat."</p><p>I walked alone through the taiga toward the river and immediately thought about all I'd seen and heard. One question persisted most of all: How did this happen to us, by which I mean most people? Every person supposedly has a homeland, but no one has his own little piece of his homeland. There is not even a law in the country to guarantee a person and his family the opportunity to own property for life, if only a single hectare of land. Parties and rulers, succeeding one another, promise all kinds of goods, but they skirt this question of a piece of the homeland for each person. Why? After all, our big Homeland is made up of small parcels, dear, small native parcels. The gardens and little houses on them. If no one has that, what will Russia be made up of then? A law should be enacted so that each person who wants to can have a piece of homeland like that. Each family that wanted this could have it. The deputies could pass the law. We all choose the deputies. That means we should choose those who agree to pass a law like that. A law. How should it be formulated? How? Perhaps like this.</p><p>"The state is obligated to provide each married couple, at their request, with one hectare of land for life-long use, with the right to bequeath. The agricultural output produced on family holdings will never be assessed any kind of tax. Family holdings will not be subject to sale."</p><p>That sounds good. But what if someone takes the land and doesn't do anything on it? Then the law also has to say, "If the land is not cultivated for three years, the state may confiscate it."</p><p>But what if a person wants to live in town and work and use his land as he would a dacha? Let him. Women are going to go to their native home to give birth anyway. Those who don't will bear children who won't forgive them later. Who will promote the law? A party? Which one? A party like that should be organized. Who will do the organizing? Where are those politicians to be found?</p><p>We have to search for them. Search quickly! Otherwise, you'll die without ever once getting to your homeland. Your grandchildren will not remember you. When will it happen that this possibility comes about? When will we be able to say, "Hello, my homeland!"?</p><p>* * *</p><p>Anastasia's grandfather was sitting on a log by the shore. Next to him, a small wooden boat tied to shore was rocking slightly on the waves. "It's not hard to row downstream a few kilometers to the next dock on the opposite bank of the river, but how is he going to row back against the current?" I thought as I greeted the old man, and I asked him about it.</p><p>"I'll make my way little by little," the grandfather replied. Usually always cheerful, this time he seemed serious and not very talkative.</p><p>I sat down on the log with him and said, "I can't figure out how Anastasia holds so much information inside her. She remembers about the past and what is happening now in our life. Does she know everything? But she lives in the taiga and takes delight in the flowers, Sun, and beasts. She doesn't seem to be thinking about anything."</p><p>"What's there to think about?" the grandfather replied. "She senses it, the information. When she needs it, she takes as much as she wants. The answers to all questions are in space, next to us, you just need to know how to access and give voice to it."</p><p>"How's that?"</p><p>"How . . . how. . . . Here you are walking down the street of a town you know well, you're thinking about your own affairs, a passerby suddenly comes up to you and asks you how to get somewhere. Would you be able to give him an answer?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"There, you see? It's all simple. You were thinking your own thoughts. A question arose that had nothing to do with what you were thinking about, but you could answer the man. The answer is kept inside you."</p><p>"But this is a request to explain how to get somewhere. If a passerby asked me what happened in the town where he and I had met well, say, a thousand years before the moment we met, no one could give him an answer."</p><p>"He couldn't if he was lazy. Everything is in each person and has been kept around him since the moment of creation. Why don't you get in the boat? It's time to cast off."</p><p>The old man sat at the oars. When we had gone about a kilometer from shore, the taciturn old man began to speak.</p><p>"Try not to get bogged down in this information and these thoughts, Vladimir. Define reality yourself. Feel matter and what you can't see yourself evenly."</p><p>"I don't understand why you're telling me this."</p><p>"You've started digging around in information, and now you're trying to define it with your mind. But your mind isn't the proper means. The volume of what my granddaughter knows won't fit in a mind, and you will stop noticing what is going on around you."</p><p>"But I notice everything. Here's the river, the boat . . ."</p><p>"So how is it you who notices everything didn't manage to say a proper goodbye to my granddaughter and your son?"</p><p>"Well, maybe I didn't. I was thinking about bigger things."</p><p>I really had left without hardly saying goodbye to Anastasia, and all the way here I'd been thinking so hard that I never noticed how I reached the river.</p><p>"Anastasia was thinking about something else, too," I replied, "something bigger, and she doesn't need the various sentiments."</p><p>"Anastasia senses all the planes of being. And she senses each, not to the detriment of another."</p><p>"Well, so what?"</p><p>"Get your binoculars out of your bag and look at the tree on the shore where our boat put out."</p><p>I looked at the tree through my binoculars. On the shore next to it stood Anastasia holding my son. There was a bundle hanging on her bent arm. She and my son were waving after the boat as it moved downstream. I waved to Anastasia, too.</p><p>"Apparently my granddaughter and her son followed you. She was waiting for you to finish your thinking, remember your son, and think of her. She also collected that bundle for you. But the information you got from her was more important to you. The spiritual, the material—everything has to be sensed equally. Then life is stable, and you can stand on two feet. When one predominates over the other, it's like being lame."</p><p>The old man spoke without malice and worked his oars nimbly.</p><p>Whether to him or to myself, I tried to answer out loud.</p><p>"The main thing for me right now is to understand, to understand for myself! Who are we? Where are we?"</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=0434>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>34. Anomalies in Gelendzhik</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Esteemed readers, everything I have written in my books I either heard from Anastasia or saw and experienced myself. All the events are real events from my life, and in describing them I have indicated, especially in the first books, real addresses and unchanged last names, something I subsequently came to regret. More and more the curious began to disturb these people.</p><p>The rumors, events, and phenomena that link me and Anastasia became a substantial problem. The unique interpretation of these events and, consequently, unique conclusions also disturb me. I cannot agree with all of them. For example, I am against worshiping the dolmens. I believe we can and should treat the dolmens with respect, but not worship them.</p><p>Among the readers of the books about Anastasia are people of different religions, spiritual beliefs, and levels of education. I believe that every interpretation of events should be given attention. Each person has a right to his own opinion, but then we should say, "This is my opinion. These are my hypotheses." Of course, no one need make a mystery all the time of everything, of either me or Anastasia. Otherwise Anastasia can be transformed from a human being, albeit a very unusual one, into an unusual being. What if she is in fact the ordinary human being and we are the oddities? There, you see: even I have started to give instructions. This is because certain circumstances worry me.</p><p>Right now, a rumor is going around at the speed of lightning about the fiery sphere Anastasia communicates with. Remember, esteemed readers, how I described in previous books how this sphere appears next to Anastasia in tense situations? It first appeared as little Anastasia cried on her parents' grave and then taught her to take her first steps. It defended her against an attempt to abduct her. To her grandfather's question, "What is this?" Anastasia replied, "It is good."</p><p>Yes, she does communicate with it, but she doesn't know completely what this natural phenomenon represents. Why have I suddenly brought up this fiery sphere that appeared out of nowhere? Because this sphere, many witnesses assert, appeared over Gelendzhik and caused a flurry. Now ill-wishers are spreading rumors that Anastasia can, if necessary, with the help of this sphere, bomb those she dislikes and that she communicates with dark forces as well as light. Here the readers themselves are pouring fat on the fire. In Tuapse, I was asked to send this sphere against the Sochi administration so that it would start seeing as clearly as Gelendzhik's.</p><p>Consequently, esteemed readers, I will now try to tell you what in fact happened in Gelendzhik, and I call on you to treat this calmly and reasonably.</p><p>In Gelendzhik, the local public association was preparing to hold a readers conference on the books. Relations between the association leadership and the town administration were strained, to put it mildly. Not only that, but in the second book I spoke unflatteringly about the town's old leadership. In this context, something like the following was bound to happen.</p><p>On the afternoon of September 17, 1999, the eve of the readers conference on the books about Anastasia, a wind came up in the town and a storm began. A fiery sphere suddenly appeared on the small square in front of the town administration building. Its further movements, people now say, resembled those of Anastasia's sphere.</p><p>The fiery sphere that appeared above Gelendzhik bypassed the lightning rods of the building surrounding the square and touched a tree standing in the middle of the square. Then several fiery spheres or smaller rays detached from the fiery sphere. One flew into the office of the town administration chief, circled the office in front of witnesses, and flew out.</p><p>A second flew into the office of the deputy head of the administration, Galina Nikolaevna, hovered in the air for a while, and then headed for the window. It drew a strange symbol on the window pane that can't be wiped off and flew away.</p><p>People go on to say that the Gelendzhik administration became holy or enlightened. They believe that after this incident the administration decided to take measures to improve hospitality for the readers coming to the town, to fix up the dolmens lying outside the town, to hold annual festivals of religious songwriting, and a lot more it had not wanted to do before.</p><p>The rumor of what happened came with the assertion that Anastasia's fiery sphere had been in Gelendzhik. I tried to advance the theory that this was ball lightning and the similarity of its behavior to what was described in the book was a random coincidence. But the town administration was still compelled to take some decision. No such luck. They immediately tried to prove to me "there are no coincidences. Furthermore, here we have not one coincidence but an entire chain. When coincidences line up in sequence and form a chain, that is called logic."</p><p>Of course, the coincidences did form a chain, you might say. So far it is unclear how the sphere bypassed the lightning rods. Why did it touch the large tree standing on the square, blaze, and rumble over it but not destroy it, instead flying toward the administration windows? Why did it fly specifically into those offices with the people in charge of affairs related to readers' visits to the town? Why, after the fiery sphere's visit, did the administration immediately decide positively on so many questions? Why after the appearance of this sphere did the chairman of the Legislative Assembly come to welcome the conference? And so on.</p><p>Talk had it that the head of the Gelendzhik town administration and the entire administrative staff had changed so much that now Gelendzhik was going to begin to flourish and, as Anastasia had said, would be "richer than Jerusalem and Rome." Others say the sphere frightened everyone.</p><p>When I arrived in Gelendzhik, I met with the town administration chief, too, and with his deputy. I saw the symbol drawn on the window by the fiery sphere and touched it. There was an unusual smell in the office, like incense or sulfur. But I did not sense any fright. On the contrary, Galina Nikolaevna, for example, the deputy head of the administration, had become even more cheerful than before. She too told me how it had all happened and asked, "What do you think? Was this some kind of sign?"</p><p>In general, circumstances argued that the theory about ordinary ball lightning was weak, and people started accusing me of downplaying the situation.</p><p>I won't hide the fact that I really did try to downplay the situation, and not only this one. Why? Because I have information about how some religious leaders are trying to frighten people about Anastasia's unusual abilities. They claim that these abilities don't come from God and that Anastasia is not a human being. They write articles about this in their religious publications. I can imagine how the situation is going to be treated now, with the sphere's appearance in Gelendzhik.</p><p>I have no intention of trying to refute or prove the fiery sphere's connection to Anastasia. That would be pointless. Here each person will have his own opinion. I want to try at least to discuss with you, esteemed readers, whether the fiery sphere that visited Gelendzhik might be a manifestation of certain forces.</p>The Bible says, "You will know them by their fruits." What kind of fruits? </p><p>First, the fiery sphere did not inflict any damage whatsoever on the administration building. Even the window it drew its sign on did not crack. The smell that lingered in </p><p>the office did not make an unpleasant impression. Galina Nikolaevna, whose office it is, spoke with me in the presence of four people, and none of them sensed fright in her. </p><p>The sphere rumbled over the tree standing on the square and created a vivid flash, people say, as if the tree had burst into flames. Now, however, it is growing in perfect </p><p>health. The administration issued a decree to improve the amenities for readers coming to the town.It decided to regulate excursions to the dolmens Anastasia spoke of. I do not see a single negative consequence. Consequently, the fruits are positive.</p><p>
Anastasia says that the fiery sphere acts only independently. It cannot be ordered. It can only be asked.</p><p>
In my books, I try to describe situations I have seen with my own eyes, felt myself, and heard with my own ears as accurately as I can. Regarding the incident of the fiery sphere in Gelendzhik, each can advance any theory of his own, but I would not like anyone to exploit this incident to frighten people.</p><p>
In addition, if things continue this way, then even the most ordinary situations could be made to seem overly mysterious. People are already beginning to talk about how this fiery sphere helped me speak at the conference in Gelendzhik, but that isn't true. I have nothing to do with it. The press has contributed its mite to these rumors, too.</p><p>
The respected Ogonyok printed a long article whose author said, "There is a large-scale experiment being conducted on the country." The article's author wrote about me, "He spoke for eight hours. I have not seen a speaker like that in a long time." Another newspaper added, "At the same time he was cool as a cucumber." All these statements are exaggerated and inaccurate, to put it mildly.</p><p>
First, I did not speak at the conference for eight hours, only six. Two hours of my speech were added on the second day.</p><p>
As for help, I did have it, but without any mysticism.</p><p>
On the eve of the conference, Anastasia arrived in Gelendzhik. On the night before the conference, she said I had to get a good night's sleep. She suggested that before going to bed I drink an infusion she had brought from the taiga, and I agreed, because lately I really had had a lot of trouble falling asleep at night. Later, when I lay down, she sat beside me and took my hand, as she had done more than once in the taiga (I described this in the chapter "A Touch of Paradise"), and I fell asleep as if I had flown off somewhere. When she had done this in the taiga, a calmness always followed.</p><p>
I woke up in the morning to beautiful weather. I felt excellent, and my mood was joyous.</p><p>
For breakfast, Anastasia offered me only cedar milk, saying that it was better not to eat meat because digesting it uses up a lot of energy. I didn't even feel like meat after the milk. After cedar milk I never feel like eating anything.</p><p>
When I spoke before the conference attendees, Anastasia was not by my side. She stood quietly in the hall among the readers for a while and then went away entirely.</p><p>
After the publications and rumors that mystified my speech at the conference, I myself thought that Anastasia had helped somehow, and I asked her, "Anastasia, did you forget completely that I'm supposed to look tired toward the end of my speech? Why did you make people think my speech so mysterious?"</p><p>
She started to laugh and replied, "What kind of mystification can it be when a well-rested person in a good mood talks to friends? The fact that you spoke for a long time—that is because your thought got confused and you tried to cover several themes at once. You could have built shorter and clearer sentences, but you couldn't because your shoes are a little tight and squeeze your feet. So your blood has a hard time circulating through your veins."</p><p>
There, you see how simple it all is in fact? There is nothing mystical about my speeches.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
Esteemed readers! More and more letters have been coming in from you asking why neither I nor the Anastasia foundation responds to critical articles in the press, to the insults and to the accusations of sectarianism against me and all my readers. Esteemed readers, I don't have time for this. What is the point of responding to those who purposely provoke scandal? In November, one journalist (His name is By... I don't want to give it in full so as not to let it go down in history) was so clever as to print the same material under different titles at one in five publications. He changed the titles and signed it with different names. He moved the sentences around in the text, reviled me, of course, and argued about morality, ethics, and venality. The editors themselves will sort this out a little later. I know how much editors dislike this sort of thing. This kind of thing is considered unethical among journalists. After all, each one paid him a fee as if it were an exclusive. Why should I argue with him? Maybe the man has nothing to eat. As for the filth and lies he spouts, I don't think they will stick to Anastasia but will all rebound on him.</p><p>
The topic of Anastasia has become popular, so won't more than one publication probably try to raise its circulation at her expense? After all, there are more than a million of you, esteemed readers. Imagine, if I start a polemic with a publication that prints squibs and has a circulation of fifty thousand, you will of course want to read it, and thus you will drastically increase their circulation. There's no need to argue with them. You know better, after all, whether you're a sectarian or not.</p><p>
If a publication insults you, the best response to it is your refusal to subscribe.</p><p>
</p><p>As for me, I can communicate with you only through my books. So here I will try to answer several questions.</p><p>
First, at the present time I am not engaged in any business, I am only writing. I do not belong to any religion. I myself am trying to sort out what's what in our life. But there will probably be more and more criticism and false inventions directed at me and Anastasia. Anastasia is probably doing a lot to block that from happening.</p><p>
They will still highlight themselves. Even now, though, it is clear that Anastasia the Siberian presents a threat both to some religions and to several industrial-financial empires here and abroad.</p><p>
It is they that are trying so hard to play up these questions in the press: "Does she exist or not?" "Who is Megre?" They themselves answer: "She does not exist." "Megre is a venal entrepreneur." In fact, they know better than others about Anastasia's existence.</p><p>
But they need, no matter what, to lead people away from the very essence of the information. They need to turn off the source of information, no matter what, to dominate and control it, and—if that doesn't work—to destroy it.</p><p>
Apparently, they have appreciated better and faster than us the information coming from Anastasia. They're laughing at those who question it or Anastasia's existence in general. Judge for yourself whether anyone can doubt, when hearing the news over the radio, the existence of the transmitting station. While someone with an intelligent look on his face was obsessing over "whether or not she exists", in Irkutsk, Tomsk, and Novosibirsk provinces there has been intensive buying and export of cedar nuts—what's more, buying for hard currency. According to reports from Novosibirsk and Tomsk, Chinese agents have been doing this. The year 1999 saw a good harvest for cedar nuts in many regions, but the Novosibirsk pharmaceutical factory is not increasing oil production. There aren't enough of the nuts—the nuts people in the West are using to make expensive medicines while painstakingly concealing the main component in them.</p><p>
Remember, esteemed readers, how back in the first book I wrote how nuts were being exported abroad? When I tried to make inquiries about cedar oil, I received a warning from Poland: "Best not to touch this matter." This year they have succeeded in carving out their own segment of the market. In the future, we shall see. In the next book I will talk about the surprise Anastasia prepared.</p><p>
I am an entrepreneur. I wanted to finish the promised books and go back into business. I did not hide my intentions from anyone and wrote about them myself back in the second book. But now my intentions have changed. Other Siberian entrepreneurs are competing in business with the Western know-it-alls.</p><p>
My intentions have changed because the organizers of critical publications continue to insult and frighten readers, calling sectarian the readers who read my foolish (in their opinion) books that have no artistic value. Of course, I do not have any higher education or experience in literary creation, and those who have all that are irritated at the popularity of the books I've written. They are especially irritated by the fact that given my level of education, I continue to refuse the service of editors. The fact that I published a five hundred-page anthology, In Anastasia's Ray the Soul of Russia Rings, simply infuriates them. I did not allow the readers' letters and poems that make up the anthology to be edited either. At the same time, I myself wrote the preface, saying that the anthology was a historic book. Even now, I continue to believe this. What else can I believe if the anthology included letters with discussions of life, man's purpose, and the present-day hopes of present-day people? The sincere letters and poems were written by people of different ages, social statuses, and religions. This anthology has been very popular. Its popularity has dispelled the myth of how modern man only needs detective novels and books on sex. People are ready to read poems, even if they are not very professional but are, on the other hand, sincere.</p><p>
I have been told more than once, "You are issuing a challenge to the entire writing fraternity and our education. They will grind you to dust. No one will ever recognize you."</p><p>
I wasn't even planning to issue a challenge to anyone as a writer. But now, when they even write in the press, explaining the books' popularity with the opinion that "Russia is a foolish country" and that all my readers are fools and sectarians, I will respond to them. I will become a writer! I will train a little more, study a little more, ask Anastasia for help, and become a writer. I will write new books and republish already published books with the best presses in the world. I will make books about Anastasia and about the people of today's Russia the best books of our millennium.</p><p>
In this way I will answer present and future critics. For now I will say this to them, "Gentlemen critics, farewell! I am leaving with Anastasia, who may be a little naïve but is beautiful, good, and sincere. We are going into our new millennium with more than a million readers, in whose hearts live a beautiful and inspired image. And what is in your hearts, gentlemen critics? Pfah . . . don't go creeping into our new millennium. You can go . . . well, in general, back to your own. If you do creep into ours, you will choke in it anyway on your own malice and envy. In our millennium, beautiful creation will begin, and the air will be clean, the water alive, and the gardens fragrant. I will continue to publish new anthologies with readers' poems and letters. I will call the series "The People's Book." You write that "the poems in them are awful," but I say they're beautiful.</p><p>
I will also put out audiocassettes with bards' songs about the Soul, Russia, and Anastasia. You say that anyone can strum a guitar. But I say that they sing with their soul, and I will add Anastasia's words: "There is no string in any galaxy capable of emitting a better sound than the sound of the human soul's song."</p><p>
</p><p>I congratulate all of you, esteemed readers, on the start of our new millennium and on the start of your beautiful creation on Earth!</p><p>
"Who Are We?" This is what I want to call the next book.</p><p>
</p><p>With esteem for you, esteemed readers,</p><p>
Vladimir Megre</p><p>

Two Civilisations</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>We are always rushing toward some place or some thing. Each of us wants to live a happy life, meet our true love, create a family. But how many of us ever achieve our wish?</p><p>What does our satisfaction or dissatisfaction with life depend on, our success or failure? Wherein lies the meaning of life for each person and for all mankind as a whole? What awaits us in the future?</p><p>These questions have persisted for a long time, but no one has answered them distinctly. Nevertheless, one would like to know the kind of country we and our children will be living in in five or in ten years . But we do not know, and are probably not all that capable of imagining our future because we are always rushing toward some place — but where?</p><p>It's incredible, but it's a fact. I received a precise notion of our country's future for the first time not from scholarly analysts or politicians but from the taiga hermit Anastasia. She did not simply show me a picture of a beautiful future but also proved through arguments the possibility of its fulfillment as soon as in our generation. She basically presented her plan for the country's development.</p><p>As I walked through the taiga from the glade where Anastasia lives, toward the river, for some reason I was visited by a firm confidence that her plan would change a great deal in the world. If one bears in mind that everything she has modeled in her thoughts has always later come to pass in real life, then we basically already live in a country whose future can be only beautiful. As I walked, I pondered the taiga hermit's words about the country's future, where even our generation might be able to live — a country without regional conflicts, crime, poverty, or illness. And although I did not understand all her thoughts, this time I did not feel like doubting anything she had said. On the contrary, I felt like proving to everyone she was right.</p><p>I firmly decided to do everything I could to implement her plan. Outwardly, it seemed quite simple. Each family needs to be given a hectare of land for lifetime use and build its own homestead on it, its own piece of the homeland. But the details of this plan had taken a firm grip on my thoughts. They were extremely simple and at the same time incredible.</p><p>Astounding! A taiga hermit rather than soil experts proved that with the correct arrangement of plantings within a plot, in just a few years the land would not only need no fertilization, but that not even very fertile soil would improve!</p><p>As her main example, Anastasia cited the taiga. The taiga has existed for millennia, everything grows in it, and no one fertilizes the taiga earth. Anastasia says that everything that grows is the incarnate thought of God, and He set everything up so that man does not need to burden himself with the problems of obtaining food. He merely has to try to understand the Creator's thought and create what is beautiful along with Him.</p><p>I can even cite a clear personal example. On the island of Cyprus, where I have had occasion to travel, the soil is rocky, but it wasn't always like that. Many centuries ago, beautiful cedar trees and fruit trees grew on the island, the purest fresh water flowed in many rivers, and the island resembled an earthly paradise. Roman legions seized the island and began chopping down cedars to build their ships. They wiped out the cedar groves on the island. Now a large part of the island is covered with very stunted scrub and grass that burns up by spring. The summer rains have become rare, and there is not enough fresh water. Cypriots have to bring fertile soil to the island over the sea in barges. Man has not made creation better, but through his barbarous interference has made it worse.</p><p>Detailing her plan, Anastasia said that a family tree must be planted without fail. Furthermore, someone who has died should be buried not in a cemetery, but in the beautiful plot of the native land he has cultivated himself. No tombstones should be placed on a grave. The person's memory should be living, not dead. The memory for relatives will be the person's living creations, and then his soul can again be embodied in matter, in his paradisiacal earthly garden.</p><p>Those buried in a cemetery cannot end up in heaven. Their souls cannot be embodied in matter as long as relatives' and friends' thoughts of their death exist. A tombstone is a monument to death. The burial ritual was thought up by the forces of darkness, and its goal is to confine the human soul at least for a while. Our Father did create suffering or even sorrow for His beloved children. All Divine creations are eternal and self-sufficient and reproduce themselves. Everything alive on earth, from the outwardly simple blade of grass to the human being, represents the harmonious single and eternal whole.</p><p>I think she's right. Look what comes of this. Now scholars claim that human thought is material. But if this is so, then it follows that the relatives of the deceased, by thinking of him as dead, thereby maintain him in his deadened state and torment his soul. Anastasia says that the human being, or rather, the human soul, can live eternally. It can be constantly embodied in a new body, but only under certain conditions. The homestead set up according to Anastasia's plan would create those conditions. I simply chose to believe this and will leave it to erudite scholars probably more qualified than I to prove or refute Anastasia's assertions about life and death.</p><p>"Oh, you will have many opponents," I told Anastasia.</p><p>She just laughed in response: "Now everything is going to come about so simply now, Vladimir. Human thought is capable of materializing and altering objects, of predetermining events, of building the future, and so it will be that the opponents who are going to try to prove the perishability of the human substance will destroy themselves, for they will produce their own demise with their own thoughts.</p><p>"Those who are able to understand their destiny and the essence of infinity will begin to live happily, reembodied eternally, for with their thoughts they themselves will create their own happy infinity."</p><p>I also liked her plan very much when I began calculating its economic logic and was convinced that anyone with the help of the homestead he founded according to Anastasia's plan could provide a comfortable existence for his children and grandchildren. It is not merely a matter of providing children with high-quality nourishment and housing. Anastasia said that the fence must be made out of living trees and woods should occupy one fourth of the hectare. Twenty-five hundred square meters of woods is approximately three hundred trees. In eighty or a hundred years, they could be chopped down. These trees would yield about four hundred cubic meters of edged board. At today's price of at least one hundred dollars per cubic meter, the total yield of well-dried finished lumber would fetch forty thousand dollars. Of course, the entire woods should not be felled, one could take the necessary part of the mature trees and immediately replace them by planting new ones. The total value of a homestead set up according to Anastasia's plan could be a million dollars or more, and any family of even average means could build it. For starters, the house can be more than modest; the main wealth would comprise the correctly and handsomely arranged plot of land. Wealthy people now already pay large sums of money to landscape design firms. There are about forty such businesses in Moscow, and they are not lacking work. The proper and handsome arrangement of the entire hundred square meters attached to a house costs, by their estimates, fifteen hundred dollars and up.</p><p>Planting a single coniferous tree six meters high costs five hundred dollars, and those who want to live in a place handsomely arranged pay those large sums. They pay because it did not occur to their parents to set up a homestead for their children. After all, this does not require being rich, all it requires is setting one's priorities correctly. How can we raise our children if we ourselves do not understand such simple things? Anastasia is right when she says that one has to begin with raising oneself.</p><p>I developed a very strong desire to have my own homestead, to take a hectare of land, to build a house, and most importantly, to plant all kinds of things around it. I wanted to set up my own piece of homeland in the way Anastasia described and so that the handsome plots of others surrounded it as well. Anastasia and our son could settle there or visit, and then the grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Perhaps my great-grandchildren would want to work in the city, but then they could come to the homestead to relax. And once a year, on 23 July, on Whole Earth Day, all relatives would gather in their own home. Of course, I would no longer be around by then, but the homestead I had planted would remain, as would the trees and garden growing on it. I would dig a small pond and stock it with fry, so there would be fish. I would plant the trees according to a special arrangement, as Anastasia said. My descendants would like some of it and want to redo some of it, but in both cases they would remember me.</p><p>I would be buried on my own homestead and ask that my grave not be marked in any way. I don't want anyone playing the hypocrite over it with a sorrowful look. I don't want there to be any sorrow at all. I don't want there to be a grave with a tombstone. I just want fresh grass and bushes to grow from my body and soar over the earth, and maybe even some kind of healthy berries for my descendants. What is the point of tombstones? None, nothing but sorrow. I want people to remember me with joy, not sorrow,
 when they come to the homestead I create. How I will create it all for them! How I will plant!</p><p>My thoughts joyously foreshadowed something grand. I have to start soon, I have to act somehow, get to town faster, but I still have ten kilometers or so to go through this forest alone. I wish it would end quickly, this forest. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, information surfaced in my mind about Russia's forests. I didn't remember all the figures, so I'll cite the data I once read in a statistical report.</p><p>"Forest is Russia's principal type of vegetation. It occupies forty-five percent of its territory. Russia possesses the greatest forest reserves in the world. As of 1993, the area of forest comprised 886.5 million hectares, and the total timber reserve 80.7 billion, which is 21.7 and 25.9 percent of the world's reserves, respectively. The fact that the second figure is greater than the first speaks to the fact that Russia possesses more mature and more productive forests than the rest of the planet as a whole.</p><p>"Forests play a tremendous role in the atmosphere's balance of gasses and the regulation of the Earth's planetary climate. The total balance for Russia's forests, calculated by B.N. Moiseyev, came to 1,789,064,800 metric tons of carbon dioxide and 1,299,019,900 metric tons of oxygen. Annually, 600 million metric tons of carbon dioxide is deposited in Russia's forests. These gigantic volumes of gas migration substantially stabilize the planet's gas makeup and climate."</p><p>There you have it! Some people say that Russia has a special mission, but that mission is not up ahead, it's already being carried out by the forest.</p><p>My goodness! People all over the planet, some to a lesser degree, some to a greater—it doesn't matter. What does matter is everyone on earth breathes Russia's air, taking in the oxygen this forest produces, and right now I'm just walking through it. I wonder whether it is just oxygen this forest supplies to all people on earth or perhaps something else important.</p><p>Now the taiga I was walking through alone did not give rise to alarm in me, as before. I felt the way you do walking through a safe park. Of course, there are no park paths in the taiga, and the way is sometimes blocked by a boulder, or thick bushes, but they didn't annoy me this time.</p><p>I picked berries I encountered along the way as I passed— raspberries, currants—for the first time I was curious to examine how different even trees of the same type are in their outward appearance, how variously the vegetation is distributed, so there is not a single identical scene.</p><p>For the first time I looked closely at the taiga, and it seemed nobler. This feeling probably arose as well from the awareness that in this taiga my little son and Anastasia, the woman who changed my entire life when I met her, were born and lived.</p><p>In this boundless taiga, there is Anastasia's small glade, which she does not like to leave for long and would not exchange for any apartment, even the most elegant. This glade is seemingly the usual blank spot: no building, no cabin, none of the accommodations necessary for daily life, whereas she immediately rejoices as soon as she approaches it. For some reason, on my third visit to Anastasia's glade, I too felt the way you do when you come home after a difficult trip.</p><p>Strange things are happening in our world in general. For millennia, human society apparently fought for the happiness and well-being of each person, but if you look closely, this very person living at the center of society, at the center of the modern civilized city, has become increasingly defenseless. Either he lands in a car wreck, or he's robbed. All kinds of pains are constantly besieging him. He can no longer live without pharmacies, or he commits suicide over some dissatisfaction. The number of suicides specifically in civilized countries with a high standard of living is mounting. Mothers from various regions appear on television and say they have nothing to feed their children and their families are starving.</p><p>Anastasia lives with her small child in the taiga, as if in a different civilization. She asks nothing from our society and needs no police or interior troops for her protection. One gets the impression that nothing bad could ever happen to her or her child in this glade.</p><p>Of course we have different civilizations, and she proposes taking the best of these two different worlds. Then the way of life will change for many people on Earth, and a happy new human community will be born. It will be an interesting community, new and unusual. For instance. . . .</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0502>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>2. Taste the Universe</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>For a long time I could not agree with the fact that Anastasia quite calmly left her still-nursing infant alone. Either she would simply lay him on the grass under some bush, or else next to some resting she-bear or she-wolf. I was already convinced that no beast would touch him. On the contrary, they would defend him to their last breath. Only from whom? If the beasts around him were like nannies, then who was there to defend against? Nevertheless, it's unsettling when an infant is left alone, and I tried to convince Anastasia not to do that.</p><p>"If beasts don't touch the child, that doesn't mean some other misfortune won't befall him."</p><p>She replied, "I cannot imagine what kind of misfortune you're thinking about, Vladimir."</p><p>"The many things that can happen to helpless children. For instance, he could climb a hillock and then roll off and twist his little leg or arm."</p><p>"The height a child can climb himself will not bring him harm."</p><p>"Well, and if he eats something harmful? He's foolish, he puts everything in his mouth, he could easily poison himself, and then who would pump his stomach? There aren't any doctors nearby, and you don't even have an enema to cleanse the child's bowels if something happened."</p><p>Anastasia only laughed. "Why an enema, Vladimir? There are other much more effective ways than enemas to cleanse the bowels."</p><p>"How's that?"</p><p>"Do you want to try? It wouldn't hurt you. I'll bring you a few herbs right away. . . ."</p><p>"Wait, no need, I understand. You want to give me something to upset my stomach."</p><p>"You've had an upset stomach for a long time. The herb will drive everything nasty from your stomach."</p><p>"I see, if anything happens you'll give the child herbs and he'll have diarrhea. But why let matters go that far with the child?"</p><p>"They won't. Our son is not going to eat anything nasty. Children, especially nursing infants used to mother's milk are never going to eat anything else in large quantities. Our son can only take a taste of one little berry or herb. If it's harmful, it will taste bitter, nasty for him, and he'll spit it out himself. If he eats a little and it starts to harm the stomach, he'll throw up; on the other hand, he will remember it and won't eat it again. But he will know the whole earth not from someone's stories but by taste. Let our son taste the Universe."</p><p>In general, she's probably right. Nothing bad has ever once happened to the child. I also noticed one interesting circumstance. The beasts that surround Anastasia's glade themselves train or teach their offspring how to interact with human beings. I used to think that it was Anastasia herself doing that, but later I became convinced that she does not spend her time on that.</p><p>Once, we were sitting at the edge of the glade, in the sun. Anastasia had just nursed our son, and he lay blissfully in her arms. First he dozed or slept a tiny bit. Then he began touching Anastasia's hair with his little hand and smiling. Anastasia looked and smiled at our son, too, and gently whispered to him.</p><p>I saw the she-wolf come out into the glade with its brood—four very little cubs. The she-wolf was walking toward us, but at about ten meters it lay down in the grass. The cubs tottering after her immediately got settled at her belly. Anastasia saw the she-wolf and cubs lying there, stood up, carrying our son, walked up to it, squatted a couple of meters from the she-wolf, and began to examine the wolf's brood with a smile.</p><p>At the same time, she said softly, "Oh, what handsome cubs our clever girl has borne. One is certain to be a leader, and this little girl is just like its mama, will bring pleasure and continue the line worthily."</p><p>The she-wolf seemed to be dozing, its eyes squinted languidly, either because it was dozing or from the caress in Anastasia's voice. The cubs left the she-wolf's belly in peace and began looking at Anastasia, and one of them, still not moving very confidently, headed in her direction.</p><p>The she-wolf, who'd seemed to be dozing, suddenly leapt up, snatched up the cub in its teeth, and tossed him back with the others. The same thing happened with another cub, and a third, and a fourth, all trying to get close to Anastasia. The foolish cubs kept up their attempts, but the she-wolf would not let them until they stopped their forays. Two cubs started wrestling and the others sat peacefully watching us. The child in Anastasia's arms also saw the she-wolf and cubs and began looking at them, then he kicked his little legs impatiently and made some summoning call.</p><p>Anastasia held out her hand to the she-wolf and cubs. Two cubs tottered toward the outstretched human hand, but this time the she-wolf did not try to stop them. On the contrary, she nudged the two playing cubs toward the outstretched hand. Soon after they were next to Anastasia. One started nipping a finger of Anastasia's outstretched hand, another rested its paws on her arm and stood, and two others crept up to her foot. My son was squirming in Anastasia's arms, obviously trying to get to the cubs. Anastasia lowered him to the grass, and he immediately forgot everything and started playing with them!
 After approaching the she-wolf and gently petting its nape, Anastasia returned to me.</p><p>I realized that the she-wolf, which was trained never to disturb Anastasia independently, would come to her only at a specific gesture, and now the she-wolf was teaching the same to its offspring. The she-wolf had probably been taught by its mother, and its mother by its mother, and so the beasts had handed down the rules for relations with human beings from generation to generation. And they are respectful relations, tactful, I must say. But who taught them the other, to attack man, and how?</p><p>In general, when you get to know the life of hermits of the Siberian taiga, lots of different questions arise, questions you could never have guessed possible before. Anastasia has no intention of changing her hermit's way of life. However, when I think about Anastasia as a hermit, I immediately associate the word "hermit" with someone isolated from society and from the information of the modern world. But what in fact happens? After each visit of mine to her glade, I publish a new book. Various people discuss it, old and young, scholars and leaders of religious confessions. Rather than me bringing her information from our all-informed society, she is presenting me with information that society finds interesting.</p><p>So who is the true hermit then? Haven't we become lost in a web of abundance, or rather, an apparent abundance of information? In fact, we have become isolated or broken off from the true source of information. What we have in fact is that Anastasia's remote taiga glade is the information center, like a cosmodrome to other dimensions of being. So who am I? Who are we? And who is Anastasia? Does this really matter now? The main thing lies elsewhere, in her latest statements concerning the possibility of transformation to a better life for the individual person, country, and human society as a whole by means of altering the conditions of an individual's daily life.</p><p>It is incredibly simple. Each person must be given at least a hectare of land, and then she goes on to tell us what needs to be done on this land and then . . . It's incredible, such simplicity. . . . And man will always have the energy of Love. There will be spouses who love each other. There will be happy children, many diseases will vanish, and wars and cataclysms will cease. Man will get closer to God.</p><p>Basically she has proposed constructing many glades similar to hers next to the big cities. At the same time, she does not reject using our civilization's achievements. "Let the negative work for the good, too," she says. I have come to believe in her project, to believe in the beautiful thing that must happen when it is implemented in our life. A lot of it seemed understandable. However, I have to check everything thoroughly one more time and think it through. Her project has to be adapted to each locale.</p><p>I was gripped by Anastasia's idea concerning land and its arrangement. I wanted to get home as fast as possible and see what scholars had to say about similar settlements. Was there anything like it in the world already? I wanted first to design the new settlement in detail and then begin to build it jointly with those wishing to take part in its construction. Of course, neither I nor anyone else alone can take responsibility for singlehandedly designing this beautiful settlement of the future. We must do it together. We will have to discuss the information together and design our settlement taking others' mistakes into account..</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0503>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>3. Auroville Dreams</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>For the first few months after my return from Anastasia's, I intensively collected and studied information on eco-settlements. Most sources spoke about foreign analogs. Altogether, I collected information on this topic for about eighty-six settlements in nineteen countries—Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England, France, Germany, India, and others. But the information was no particular cause for rejoicing. No country had a sufficiently broad movement, and there were no settlements capable of wielding significant influence on the social situation in those countries. One of the largest and best-known settlements was in India, the town of Auroville. I will speak about it in a little more detail.</p><p>Auroville was founded in 1968 by Mirra Richard, the wife of integral yoga founder Sri Aurobindo. It was proposed that on lands set aside by the Indian government not far from Pondicherry, where the Sri Aurobindo ashram—a center for integral yoga devotees—had been operating since the 1940s, a settlement would appear and a city of fifty thousand would rise up. "Auroville"—which means "City of the Dawn," or "City of the Morning Dawn—was supposed to bring to life the idea of unifying people connected by a common goal of building a harmonious material world that is not in contradiction with the world of the spirit. In the charter she wrote, Mirra Richard said, "Auroville will be a site of material and spiritual researches for a living embodiment of an actual Human Unity."</p><p>The idea of creating a city where people would live in harmony with the world of nature, in harmony with spirit and love, was approved by the Indian government, Indira Gandhi personally, and UNESCO, and received financial support from the Indian government and many sponsors. Representatives from 121 countries and 23 Indian states attended the founding ceremony. A beautiful city—the dream of probably the majority of the world's "spiritual" people—began to be built.</p><p>However, after Mirra Richard's death in 1973, Aurobindo's pupil, Satprem, came out harshly against Auroville, calling it nothing but a "commercial enterprise." The Sri Aurobindo ashram, which controlled the majority of the "enterprise's" finances, laid claim to power over everything that went on in the city, but the settlers felt that their commune belonged to the whole world and the Ashram could not give it orders. An acute confrontation began between the spiritual ashram and the spiritual Aurovillians. The confrontation was not only on the spiritual level but kept moving more and more onto the physical. In 1980, the Indian government was forced to issue a decision on removing Auroville from the control of the Sri Aurobindo Society. A permanent police station appeared in the settlement. The Auroville situation contributed to the general crisis in Sri Aurobindo's movement and teaching.</p><p>Today, about 1200 people live in Auroville, not the more than 50,000 the organizers proposed. The entire region counts 13 villages, 30,000 people, along with the local residents. The reason for the Auroville dream's failure may lie in the following situation. If an Aurovillian has permission, he has the right to build himself a house, but legally the land it stands on will belong to Auroville. The land is acquired with the Aurovillian's funds, but in the name of Auroville. In this way, Auroville is given complete confidence but none of its residents has its complete confidence. Each resident is dependent. But after all, the project was the work of people who considered themselves highly spiritual. Evidently there is another side to the spirituality coin.</p><p>Auroville's present-day status has seriously upset and depressed me. No doubts have arisen concerning Anastasia's project; however, negative thoughts have entered my mind. If they can't make a normal settlement in India work, a country considered practically the leader in its spiritual understanding of human existence, if this couldn't be made to work with financial support from the Indian government, UNESCO, and sponsors from different countries, then how could Anastasia alone foresee all the snags? Even if she was not alone, even if a mass of readers sharing her views attempted to plan everything, think it through, foresee, it might not be made to work by all of them together because no one has experience.</p><p>If anyone knew the cornerstone on which a happy existence can be built for the individual person and a community as a whole, then a happy community could probably be built somewhere. But it hasn't been, not in a single country. We have only negative experience. Where are we to find positive experience?</p><p>"In Russia!" Anastasia replied.</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0504>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>4. Precursors of a New Civilisation</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>"The shoots of the beautiful new future are in the Russian summer people!" These words sounded of their own accord, inside me. At that moment, Anastasia was not nearby. I instantly remembered the excitement and delight with which she spoke about Russian summer people four years before. She believes that it is thanks to the summer people that a planetary disaster did not occur on Earth in 1992. As it happened, it was in Russia that this amazing movement began, caressing a part of the Earth. I remembered her talking about this.</p><p>"Millions of human hands touched the Earth in love—their hands, not their various mechanisms. Russians touched the Earth tenderly on their small dacha plots, and it sensed this. The Earth sensed the touch of each hand individually. The Earth may be big, but it is very, very sensitive, and it found the strength to hold on."</p><p>Four years ago, I did not take this statement seriously, but now, after becoming familiar with many attempts by people from various countries to create spiritual-ecological settlements, I suddenly understood. In Russia, without high-profile proclamations, appeals, publicity, and pomposity, the largest-scale project was embedded in reality, a project having significance for all humanity. In the context of the many Russian dacha societies, information from different countries
 in the world about their creation of eco-settlements became simply silly.</p><p>Judge for yourself. In front of me lies a pile of articles and various collections where the problem is earnestly discussed of how many people should live in an eco-settlement—they advise no more than 150, and they lend great significance to religious guidance for eco-settlement government structures.</p><p>But Russia's dacha cooperatives have existed for years and count three hundred families and more apiece. Each is administered by one or two people, often retirees. Can the chair of a Russian dacha cooperative be called a manager? He is more like a registering body or an administrator carrying out the majority's will.</p><p>Russia's dacha movement has no centralized administrative bodies in general, but meanwhile the State Statistics Committee data for 1997 proclaim that 14.7 million families have orchards and 7.6 million have vegetable gardens. They cover 1,821,000 hectares. The population is independently cultivating 90 percent of the potatoes, 77 percent of the fruits and berries, and 73 percent of the vegetables.</p><p>Theoreticians who have been studying plans for eco-settlements and eco-villages for years will probably object that a dacha cooperative is not an eco-settlement, to which I respond immediately that this is a matter of essence, not names.$$The overwhelming majority of Russia's dacha cooperatives operate by eco-settlement principles. Not only that, but without making high-flown statements about spiritual perfection or the need for a protective attitude toward nature, summer people have by their way of life, in deed rather than in words, shown their own spiritual growth. They have planted millions of trees. Thanks to their efforts, orchards now bloom on hundreds of thousands of hectares, formerly considered wasteland, not arable, so-called worthless land.</p><p>We hear that some Russians are practically starving. First teachers, then miners are striking, and politicians busily search for ways to solve the country's crisis. More than once during perestroika, Russia was a hair's breadth away from a wide-scale social explosion. But it didn't happen. Now let us try removing from recent years 90 percent of the potatoes, 77 percent of the berries and fruits, and 73 percent of the vegetables. Instead of these percentages, let us add the level of nervousness of millions of people. This will have to be done if we exclude from recent years the consoling factor of dachas. You don't even have to be a psychologist to see whom summer people calm down when they come in contact with their gardens. So what would we have had in 1992, 1994, or 1997? In any of those years there could have been a tremendous social explosion. What might it bring to a planet crammed with deadly weapons?</p><p>But the catastrophe didn't happen. Anastasia says that there was no planetary-scale catastrophe in 1992, thanks only to Russia's summer people, and now, after familiarizing myself with the information clarifying the situation, I believe her.</p><p>Right now, it isn't that important which smart mind in our country's leadership came up with the decision to give the green light to the dacha movement in Russia, at that time still the Soviet Union. Perhaps it suited providence to embed such a thing in Russia specifically. Right now something else is important: the movement exists. It is the most vivid proof of the possibility of achieving stability in the human community, possibly the stability toward which many peoples on the different continents have striven for millennia and been unable to reach.</p><p>Anastasia says that the dacha movement in Russia represents the greatest turning point in the development of the human community. "Summer people are the precursors of what is beautiful"—by which she means the plan she has drawn for future settlements. I myself would like to live in one of those beautiful settlements and for it to be in a prosperous country called Russia.</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0505>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>5. A Search for Proof</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>Russia of the future . . . This is a beautiful country where many from our present generation will have a chance to live a happy life.</p><p>Russia of the future is a country that will turn the planet's human community toward happiness. I saw a beautiful, flourishing Russia. It was she, Anastasia, who showed me our country's future, and it became absolutely unimportant and insignificant how this ardent, resilient hermit living in the middle of the Siberian taiga was able to travel to other planets, into the future or the past. How she connected with invisible threads the souls of people living in different countries, into a united, exciting impulse to create. What is important is something completely different: the fact that this impulse exists. Does it really matter where she gets so much information of every kind and knowledge about our life? Incomparably more important is the result of this knowledge—the fact that people in different cities who have come in contact with her information are planting cedar allées, that they have started to produce cedar oil, and more and more songs and poems are appearing about the beautiful.</p><p>Fantastic! She dreams of something, I write it down, and before you know it, it's come true! Some fantasy! But after all, this fantasy is coming true in real life for all to see. She has dreamed of a beautiful country. Could that really come true, too? It has to. I have to help her somehow.</p><p>Calculating and analyzing what Anastasia told and showed me, I became increasingly convinced of the reality of a beautiful future. I believed in it.</p><p>I began to believe everything Anastasia said, but I just could not finish writing and publishing the chapter about Russia's future. It didn't belong in the previous book, "Co-Creation." The issuing of this book was held up because of it. I wanted everything said to be sufficiently convincing and real, so that not only I myself but many others as well would believe and begin to act, to create a beautiful future. But I simply could not be completely convincing, due to a few things Anastasia said.</p><p>In "Co-Creation," I reported Anastasia's assertion that all the nature that surrounds us is nothing but God's materialized thoughts. If man could understand them just in part, he would not need to spend a lot of effort obtaining food and fertilizing the land, since it itself could restore its own fertility, nor would he have to waste effort on fighting different pests and weeds. His thoughts would be released from everyday problems, and he could take up a matter more central to his existence: the joint creation with God of beautiful worlds. I wanted lots of people to believe what she said. But how could people trust her if all of agro technology—and not only in our country—cannot get along without fertilizers?</p><p>Many plants in different countries of the world are busy producing various chemicals to add to the soil. I brought up this question a few times with agricultural scientists, but I always got more or less the same condescending answer. "One could, of course, set up a paradisiacal garden on one hectare of land, but you would have to work in this garden from morning to night. Without adding fertilizers to the soil, there won't be a good harvest. You can't get along without the use of pesticides, either, because many pests will destroy a crop." To the argument Anastasia cited about how everything grows in the taiga without man's assistance, the scientists said, "Let's say it does. But if we are to believe your hermit, then the taiga's program was set directly by God. Man needs more than what grows in the taiga. For example, the taiga has no orchard. Because an orchard requires man's care. It cannot grow itself."</p><p>I visited several gardening stores a few times. I stood in the stores and observed many buying various bags of chemicals. I looked at these people and thought they would never believe what Anastasia said, and that meant it made no sense to write about Russia's future. They wouldn't believe in it. They wouldn't believe because this future is linked above all with a new consciousness, a different attitude toward the land and the environment. But there is not a single modern man who could confirm what she said, not a single real-life example confirming her words. In reality, it's just the opposite: everything contradicts her. Plants produce an array of pesticides. Networks of stores sell fertilizers and chemicals. Many engage in scientific research on the earth. The absence of weighty proofs for Anastasia's assertions had such a powerful effect on me that I couldn't write anything at all. So I agreed to go to Innsbruck, Austria. I had a call from a publisher in Germany who said that Leonard Hosheneng, director of the Bioenergetics Institute, had invited me to talk about Anastasia before Europe's leading healers. The institute paid for my travel and stay and was prepared to pay a thousand marks for each hour I spoke. I didn't go there for the money, but rather to search for convincing arguments, understandable to many people, for and against Anastasia's project and her assertions about Russia's future.</p><p>Dr. Hosheneng, who had invited me to speak to the healers, himself was a professional physician and well-known hereditary healer. His grandfather had treated the family of the Japanese emperor and many others of high rank. He personally owned, apart from the institute building, several comfortable hotels were many patients stayed who had come from European countries as well as a restaurant, a park, and a few other buildings downtown. He was a millionaire, but despite the impression many Russians have about the way of life of a Western rich man, Leonard, as I learned, did all the important treatment work himself. He saw
 personally each person who came to see him, as many as fifty a day, and he often worked sixteen hours at a stretch. Only sometimes did he entrust an appointment to . . . a healer from Russia.</p><p>I spoke to the healers who had gathered in Innsbruck, realizing that Anastasia interested them above all. I devoted the large part of my speech to telling them about her, and at the end spoke a little about her project, secretly hoping to hear from those gathered confirmation or refutation of her plan for a future Russia. But they neither confirmed nor refuted anything, they just kept asking clarifying questions.</p><p>That evening Hosheneng gave a banquet in a restaurant. I would call it simply a dinner. Each person could order whatever he wanted, but everyone was modest, preferring salads, and no one drank alcohol or smoked. I did not order a drink, either, not because I was afraid of looking like a white crow among them, I simply did not feel like having meat or alcohol for some reason. At this dinner we talked about Anastasia again. That was where the phrase was born. I don't remember who uttered it first: "Russia's beautiful future is linked to the Siberian Anastasia." The words were picked up, and they were repeated in various interpretations by the healers from Italy, Germany, and France.</p><p>I waited for specifics. Why, at what expense would the beautiful come to be? But no one offered specific proofs. The healers based themselves on their intuition, but I needed proof. Could the earth feed man without special expenditures on its part, merely at the expense of man correctly understanding the thought of a God no one could see?</p><p>Returning to Russia, I recalled the words of the European healers, once again, without any particular hope, and attempted to find specific proofs, for which I was prepared to go anywhere. But I did not have to go far. An incredible coincidence, so incredible it seemed as if someone had set it up on purpose, presented not simply theoretical proofs but was a living, real confirmation of Anastasia's words.</p><p>What happened was the following.</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0506>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>6. An Eternal Garden</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>I went to the country with associates of the Anastasia Foundation for Culture and Creative Support of the City of Vladimir. We spread out on the picturesque shore of a small pond. The women put out salads for dinner and the men took care of a fire. I was standing on the shore looking at the water and thinking my own thoughts. My mood was less than great. Then Veronika, who lives in a nearby village, spoke to me.</p><p>"Vladimir Nikolaevich, about seven kilometers from here, among the meadows, there are two former nobleman's estates. There is no trace of the buildings there; all that's left are the orchards. No one looks after them, but they bear fruit every year. They yield more fruit than the village trees that people tend and fertilize. In 1976, there was a deep freeze in these parts, and people's orchards perished. So they had to plant new ones, but the freeze didn't touch these two orchards in the middle of the field. In fact, not a single one of those trees died."</p><p>"Why didn't the freeze touch them?" I ask. "Are they a special frost-resistant kind?"</p><p>"They're ordinary kind. But on these former noblemen's estates, everything was set up in a certain way, everything was planted in a certain way on a single hectare. You have to understand, everything there is set up very similarly to what Anastasia says in your books. About two hundred years ago, people planted Siberian cedars and our oaks around these orchards. Not only that, but the hay from the grass that grows there is lusher, and it doesn't spoil for much longer. If you want to take a look, we can go there right now. The road runs through the field, but the SUV will get through."</p><p>I could not believe my ears. Who? How? This kind of gift being offered up at the right time and the right place? Are the chance incidents that happen to us truly chance?</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>The track ran through the fields of a former state farm. I say fields, but they looked more like meadows luxuriant in grass.</p><p>"The sowed area is less now because the agro company doesn't have any money for fertilizer," Evgeny, Veronika's husband, commented. "On the other hand, the land is resting. "And not only the land. This year the birds began to sing. They've never chirped so cheerfully before. What are they so happy about? Maybe that the grass in the fields is free of chemicals now. Before the revolution, there were villages in these meadows. My granny used to talk about them. Now no trace of any village remains. There it is—look, there, to the right of the track—the former nobleman's estate."</p><p>Off in the distance, on an area of about one hectare, tall trees grew thickly. This place amid the fields and meadows seemed like simply a green island of forest, shaped at random. When we drove up closer, I saw amid the dense two-hundred-year-old oaks and shrubbery the entrance into a forest oasis. We walked through this entrance and . . . inside . . . inside, you see, old apple trees with callused trunks spread their branches into the space, their branches sprinkled unusually thickly with fruit. Not dug around, growing amid the grass, not sprayed against pests, the old apple trees were bearing fruit, and their fruits were not wormy. Some of the trees were quite old and their branches were breaking under the fruits' weight. Quite old—this was probably their last year for bearing.</p><p>Soon they would die off, but next to each very old apple tree, shoots of a new tree were already poking through the ground. "These trees must be about to die," it occurred to me, "but they won't until they see fresh and established shoots from their own seed."</p><p>I walked through the orchard, tasted its fruits, and wandered among the oaks growing around it, and it was as if I could see the thoughts of the person who had created this beautiful oasis come to life. It was as if I could hear him thinking, "Here, around the orchard, I need to plant an oak grove. It will protect the orchard from the cold and the heat in a drought year. The birds will build their nests in the high trees and won't let worms make themselves at home. Here I'll plant a shady allée of oaks on the shores of a pond. The oaks' crowns will join when they grow up, and below, the wide allée will be shady as well."</p><p>Suddenly, another vague thought seemed to make my blood pulse faster through my veins. What did it want from me, this thought? And like a flash, of course, Anastasia! She is right, of course, when she says, "You can feel God by coming in contact with and continuing His creations." Not through grimacing, leaping, and new-fashioned rituals, but by turning to Him and His thoughts directly, you probably can understand His desires and your own purpose. Here I am now, standing on the shore of a manmade pond, under oak trees, and it is as if I were reading the thoughts of the person who had created this vital creation. And he, this person, this Russian who lived here two hundred years ago, probably more than others felt the thoughts of the Creator and so was able to fashion a heavenly creation—his own orchard, his own family nest.</p><p>He died, this Russian, but his nest remains and is bearing its own fruits, and feeding the children from the neighboring villages, who come here in fall to treat themselves to its fruits, which someone else gathers and sells. And you, you Russian, probably wanted your grandchildren and great-grandchildren to live here. Of course you did! Because you created something eternal, not some perishable cottage. Yet where are they now, your grandchildren and great-grandchildren? Your homestead is abandoned, the grass is overgrown, and the pond is drying up, but for some reason the allée has not grown up in tall weeds, there is only grass on it, like a carpet. The heavenly corner you created, your homestead, must still be waiting for your grandchildren. Decades pass and centuries, but it waits. So where are they? Who are they now? Whom do they serve? What do they worship? Who drove them out of here?</p><p>Might we not blame our revolution for everything? Of course we can. People only revolt when there is a cardinal change for the majority in their consciousness. So what happened in the minds of your contemporaries, Russian, for your homestead to be abandoned?</p><p>Local old-timers tell stories about how the old Russian gentleman averted a bloody slaughter at his estate.</p><p>When a revolutionary mob, heated up with home brew, assembled from the two neighboring villages and went to loot his homestead, the old gentleman came out to greet them with a basket of apples and died from a shot from a double-barreled gun. The night before he had known they were assembling to loot his home, but he talked his grandson, a Russian officer, into leaving the estate. The grandson, who had fought at the front and had been decorated with the Order of St. George, left with his fellow officers, who had trilinear rifles over their shoulders and a battle-tested machine-gun on a carriage. He probably became an émigré and now ha his own grandchildren growing up.</p><p>Your grandchildren are growing up in another country, Russian, while in Russia, on your homestead, the leaves of your orchard trees are rustling in the breeze and each year the old apple trees are bearing fruit, astounding the neighboring inhabitants with their abundant harvest. Not even a trace remains of your house and outbuildings; they were all carted off. But your orchard lives in spite of everything, probably in the hopes that your grandchildren will return and try the best apples in the world. But your grandchildren never seem to come.</p><p>Why is this happening and who forces us to search for our own well-being to the detriment
 of others? Who forces us to breathe air saturated with toxic gases and dust rather than flower pollen and beneficial ethers? Who forces us to drink water poisoned by gases? Who are we now? Who? Why aren't your grandchildren returning to your family nest, Russian?</p><p>* * *</p><p>The apples at the second estate were even more delicious than at the first. Handsome Siberian cedars had been planted around this orchard. "There used to be more cedars. Now there are only twenty-three left," the local inhabitants told me. "After the revolution, when there were still official workdays, they gave people cedar nuts for their work. Now everyone who wants to gathers them. However, sometimes they strike the cedars very hard with heavy beams to make the cones fall."</p><p>Planted two hundred years ago, the twenty-three Siberian cedars stood in a row, like soldiers, shielding the beautiful orchard against frosty winds and pests. There had been more, but one by one they died because in Siberia, tall pines always grow around a cedar grove. A single cedar cannot withstand gusts of wind, and its root system is not large. The cedar feeds through its crown as well as its roots. And so the pines protect them. Here the cedars were lined up. For the first hundred fifty years they held on, and then, when their crowns bushed out, they began to fall, one after another.</p><p>In fifty years, no one had thought to plant a pine or birch nearby. So the Siberian cedars countered the evil wins in just their one row, protecting the orchard. One of them must have started falling last year, but it rested on its neighbor's crown. I looked at the heavily-tilted trunk, the crown of which was intertwined with the crown of the one standing next to it. Their branches had intertwined and the falling one had not perished. Both trees were green and bearing fruit. Only twenty-three were left. They still stood, supporting each other, bearing fruit, and protecting the orchard.</p><p>Please, hold on a little longer, Siberians. I will write. . . .</p><p>Anastasia, you taught me to write books, but why didn't you teach me words that would make what I've written understandable to many people at once? A great many people! Why haven't I managed this? Why does my thinking get confused? Why do the cedars fall while people look on and do nothing?</p><p>Not far from the former estates, which had preserved until now their beautiful orchards and shady allées, there are villages. The sight of these villages spoils the entire surrounding landscape. If you look at them from afar, you get the impression that some kind of worm has come in and fouled everything, digging up the flowering meadows. Thickets of gray village houses, outbuildings slapped together from all kinds of rotting materials, and muddy roads rutted by trucks and tractors contribute to this impression. I asked the local inhabitants, "Have you been to the orchards located among the cedars and oaks?" Many had been there and tried the apples, and the young people went there for picnics. "It's pretty there," say both the old and the young. When asked why someone hasn't set up his own orchard in its image and likeness, they give roughly the same answer. "We don't have the kind of money the gentlemen who created that beauty had." The old people talk about how the gentleman brought the cedar saplings all the way from Siberia. When asked, "How much money would you need to take the cedar nuts from the cedars bearing them and plant them in the ground?" —silence. . . .</p><p>This silence leads me to the following thought. It is not the lack of opportunity or means but some coding within us that is to blame for the mess we're in.</p><p>Right now, those who have money have built lots of homes. Next to these homes the land has been dug up or paved with asphalt. In twenty or thirty years, this home will require repairs, and the children won't need this ramshackle place, this homestead, this homeland, and they will go their separate ways to find a new one. But they will take with them the same puzzling coding, inherited from their parents, and repeat the life of timeservers on the land rather than creators of something eternal. Who can remove this coding for despair and how?</p><p>Perhaps the future of Russia that Anastasia has talked about and revealed will somehow help with this. In order to dispel the doubts of skeptics, I have placed on the inside cover photographs of the amazing Russian orchards spreading their fruit-laden branches, into a future Russia.</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0507>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>7. Anastasia's Russia</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br><div class=img><img src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/living-well-in-the-family-homestead-vk.com-kumar82.jpg></div></div></p></p><p> </p><p>When Anastasia was talking about a future of settlements made up of homesteads, I asked her, "Anastasia, please show me the future Russia. You can do that."</p><p>"I can. What place in the future Russia do you want to see, Vladimir?"</p><p>"Moscow, for example."</p><p>"Do you want to be in the future alone, Vladimir, or with me?"</p><p>"I'd rather with you. You'll explain if I see anything I don't understand."</p><p>The warm touch of Anastasia's hand immediately plunged me into a dream.</p><p>Anastasia showed me Russia's future through the same method she had shown me life on another planet. Someday scientists will probably understand how she does this, but in this case the method itself is absolutely unimportant. In my view, what is most important is the information about what specific actions we must take to enter into this beautiful future.</p><p>Moscow of the future was like nothing I had expected. The city had not spread out. There were none of the expected skyscrapers. The walls of the old buildings were painted cheerful colors, and many had pictures, landscapes, and flowers drawn on them by. as became clear later, foreign workers. First they covered the walls with some kind of reinforcing solution, and then the artists, who were also foreigners, drew all over them. The stalks of twisting plants dropped from the roofs of many buildings, and their leaves rustled in the wind, seeming to greet passers-by.</p><p>Nearly all the capital's streets and avenues were planted in trees and flowers. Right in the middle of the thoroughfare on a section of Kalininsky Avenue on the New Arbat, there was a green median about four meters wide. Its concrete border rose about half a meter over the asphalt and was filled with earth from which grew grass and wildflowers. Trees alternated at short intervals: mountain ash with red clusters, birches, poplars, currant and raspberry bushes, and many other plants, such as one encounters in a natural forest.</p><p>The same green beds divided many Moscow avenues and broad streets. There were almost no cars on the reduced thoroughfares of the streets and avenues. Mainly there were buses, where people who did not outwardly resemble Russians rode. On the sidewalks, too, there were many pedestrians who did not look Russian. I even had the brief thought that Moscow had been seized by more technically developed countries. Anastasia reassured me, however, that I was seeing foreign tourists now, not invaders.</p><p>"And what attracts them so in Moscow?"</p><p>"The atmosphere of great creation, the life-giving air and water. Look how many people are standing on the banks of the Moscow River, scooping up water by dropping vessels on ropes from the high embankment and drinking the river water with great joy."</p><p>"How can they drink unboiled water straight from the river?"</p><p>"Look, Vladimir, how clean and clear the water is in the Moscow River. The water in it is life-giving and uncontaminated by gas, like in the bottles sold in stores all over the world."</p><p>"This is fantastic! I can't believe it!"</p><p>"Fantastic? But in the same way, in your youth you and others your age would have thought it fantasy if you had heard from someone that soon water would be sold."</p><p>"Well, yes, people would scarcely have believed something like that when I was young. But how could they make the river water in a city as big as Moscow clean?"</p><p>"By not littering, not disposing toxic wastes, and not dumping garbage on the riverbanks."</p><p>"It's all that simple?"</p><p>"Exactly, it's not fantastic, it's simply all how it is. Right now the Moscow River is even protected from runoff over the asphalt, and all dirty ships are forbidden to travel on it. The Ganges River, which flows in India, was considered holy, and now the whole world bows before the Moscow River, its water, and the people who restored pristine vitality to the water. People come from different countries to look at the marvelous wonder, taste it, and be healed."</p><p>"But where are the Muscovites themselves and why are there so few cars on the streets?"</p><p>"Approximately one and a half million Muscovites reside in the capital permanently, and more than ten million tourists come from different countries of the world," Anastasia replied, and she added, "There are so few cars because the remaining Muscovites structure their day more rationally so that they have reduced their need for transportation. Their job, as a rule, is nearby, and they can reach it on foot. The tourists move around only by subway and bus."</p><p>"But what's happened to the rest of the Muscovites?"</p><p>"They are living and working at their beautiful homesteads."</p><p>"So who works at the plants and factories and who provides services for the tourists?"</p><p>Anastasia told me the following.</p><p>"When the year 2000, according to the calendar used on earth, was coming to an end, Russia's leadership was still deciding on its plans for the country's future development. Most Russians were not inspired by the path Western countries considered prosperous had developed.</p><p>Russians had tried foods from those countries, and they didn't like them. It had become clear that along with the development of so-called scientific-technical progress in these countries, various illnesses of the flesh and soul had arisen. Crime and drug abuse rose, and women were losing the desire
 to give birth.</p><p>The conditions in which the people of the developed Western countries were living did not attract Russians. However, they also did not want to return to the old social structure, and they had yet to see a new path. A depression intensified in the country, overwhelming the greater part of the community. Russia's population was aging and dying.</p><p>At the beginning of the new millennium, at the initiative of the Russian president, a decree was approved on the free allocation of one hectare of land to each Russian family that wanted to start their own homestead. This decree spoke about how the land was being allocated for life use, with the right to hand it down by inheritance. The food produced on a homestead was not subjected to any taxes.</p><p>Legislators supported the president's initiative, and the appropriate amendment was made to the country's Constitution. The decree's main goal, so the president and legislators believed, was to reduce unemployment in the country, ensure a minimum subsistence for poor families, and solve the refugee problems. But no one could have fully guessed what happened as a consequence.</p><p>When the first portion of land was allocated for organizing a settlement of more than two hundred families, not only poor people left without work and resettlers who had fallen upon misfortune took plots for setting up a homestead. Primarily they were snatched up by families of average wealth and wealthy entrepreneurs from among your readers, Vladimir. They had been preparing for this event. They had not simply been waiting, either. Many of them had already started seeds of plants and native trees planted in clay pots in their apartments, and the future mighty cedars and oaks had sent up their still small shoots.</p><p>It was at the initiative of entrepreneurs and using their means that a project was created for a settlement with the infrastructure inherent to such an existence, as you wrote in your book "Co-Creation." The plan provided for a store, first aid station, school, club, roads, and much else. Of the total number of people who expressed the desire to arrange their daily life in the first new settlements, entrepreneurs comprised about a half. . . .</p><p>Each of them had his own business and source of income. What they needed to carry out the construction and to set up the gardens was manpower. Bringing in their poor neighbors as workers for the construction and the setting up turned out to be ideal. In this way, some of the families immediately got a job and, consequently, a source for financing their own construction. The entrepreneurs understood that no one would do the job with more effort or higher quality than those who themselves were going to live in the settlement, and so they invited only specialists, if such were not to be found among the future residents of the new settlement under construction.</p><p>Each person strove to bring about independently only the layout of their future orchard and woods, the planting of native trees and a living garden.</p><p>The majority did not have enough experience and knowledge about how best to set up their plot and so elderly people who had retained this knowledge enjoyed special respect among the future inhabitants. Special attention was paid to landscaping rather than perishable structures and homes alone. The actual building where people intended to live was just a small part of God's large, living home.</p><p>Five years later, homes had been built for the permanent residents on all the plots. They varied in size and architecture, but soon people saw that the size of a house was by no means its main feature. The main thing lay elsewhere, and it came to be drawn in the beautiful outlines of the landscape of each individual plot and of the entire settlement as a whole.</p><p>There were also small oaks and cedars planted on each plot. A living fence for the estates was springing up. But with each new spring, even more small apple and cherry trees bloomed assiduously in the young orchards, and the flowers in the flowerbeds and the grass quickly resembled a beautiful living carpet. The spring air was filled with salutary aromas and flower pollen. The air became vivifying, and every woman living in the new settlement wanted to give birth. This desire arose not only in young families, but also people considered old suddenly began to have children. People wanted it so that if they did not live to see the beautiful piece of land created by their hands, then their children would, to their great joy, and they would continue the work begun by their parents.</p><p>At the beginning of the new millennium, the first sign of the Earth's beautiful, happy future was any living shoot in each estate. People who had laid the permanent foundations of the first homesteads still did not completely sense the significance of what they had done. They had simply started to look on the world around them more joyfully. They still did not realize what great joy they had brought through their actions to their Heavenly Father. The Father shed tears of joy and tenderness on the earth among drops of falling rain. He smiled with the Sun and with the branches of the young trees stealthily tried to stroke those who had suddenly become aware of eternity, His children who had returned to Him.</p><p>The Russian press began writing about the new settlement, and many people wanted to see this beautiful place in order to create something similar themselves—and maybe even better.</p><p>The inspiration to create something beautiful gripped millions of Russian families. They began building settlements similar to the first settlement in different regions of Russia. A widespread movement began similar to that of today's summer people.</p><p>Twenty years after the first decree was issued giving people the opportunity to build their own life independently and make it a happy one, more than thirty million families were engaged in creating their own homesteads, their own piece of homeland. They cultivated their beautiful plots using the eternal material created by God. In this way they created together with Him.</p><p>Each transformed his own hectare, received for lifelong use, into a corner of heaven. On the vast expanses of Russia, one hectare was a very small piece, but there were many such pieces which made up the greater homeland. Through these pieces, created by good hands, greater Russia flourished like a heavenly garden. Their Russia!</p><p>On each hectare of land, coniferous and deciduous trees were planted. People had realized how they would fertilize the land and that the local grasses would balance the soil composition. It never occurred to anyone to use chemical fertilizers or toxic pesticides.</p><p>The air and water in Russia changed. They became healthful. The food problem was completely solved. Each family easily and without special effort not only provided itself with food from what grew on their estate, but they could sell the surplus.</p><p>Each Russian family having its own estate became free and rich, and all Russia, compared with other states in the world, became the richest and most powerful state.</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0508>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>8. The Richest State</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>"Wait, Anastasia. I don't understand how the entire country suddenly became rich. You yourself said that the food produced on a homestead was not subjected to any taxes, so what did the state get rich on?"</p><p>"What do you mean 'what?' You must think more closely, Vladimir. You're the entrepreneur."</p><p>"Because I'm an entrepreneur, I know that the state has always tried to collect as much tax from each person as possible. Now, thirty million families have been released from taxes altogether. These families could get rich, of course, but in those conditions the state should definitely go bust."</p><p>"It didn't. First, unemployment disappeared entirely since someone who could not find employment in today's usual industry or other commercial or state structure could devote himself fully or partially to work, or put more precisely, to creation on his own homestead. The absence of unemployment immediately freed up financial resources for supporting those people. The provision of food at the expense of these families freed the state from any expenditures on agriculture. But this is not the main thing. Thanks to the many families who had set up their homesteads in accordance with the divine plan, the Russian state received much more revenue than that brought today by the sale of oil, natural gas, and other resources traditionally considered the main sources of income."</p><p>"What can bring greater profit than oil, gas, and weapons sales?"</p><p>"A lot, Vladimir—for instance, air, water, ethers, contact with the energy of creation, perception of the pleasant."</p><p>"This is not very clear, Anastasia. Cite specifics. Where did the money come from?"</p><p>"I'll try. The unusual changes in Russia attracted the attention of many people all over the world. The international press began to write about the significant change in most Russians' way of life. This topic became the main one for the majority of people on the whole planet. A huge influx of tourists surged into Russia. There were so many that it was impossible to accept everyone who wanted to come, and many had to wait their turn for several years. Russia's government also had to limit the sojourns of foreign tourists in the country, since many of them, especially the elderly, tried to be in Russia for several months, and sometimes even years.</p><p>"Russia's government imposed large levies on each foreigner coming into the country, but this did nothing to reduce the number of people wishing to do so."</p><p>"But why did they themselves want to be here if they could see it all on television? You said that the press of the whole world reported on life in the new Russia."</p><p>"People from the
 different countries also wanted to breathe Russia's air, which had become salubrious, to drink the life-giving water, to taste fruits found nowhere else in the world, to interact with people who had taken strides into the divine millennium and thereby delight their soul and heal their suffering flesh."</p><p>"What were these unusual fruits that appeared? What are they called?"</p><p>"The names are the same as before, but the quality is completely different. You yourself know, Vladimir, how much better tomatoes and cucumbers cultivated in open soil under direct sunlight are than hothouse ones. Vegetables and fruits cultivated on land where harmful chemicals are not used are even more delicious and healthful. They become even more so when all kinds of herbs and trees grow nearby. The mood and attitude of the person cultivating the fruits is also significant. The ethers contained in the fruits also hold very great benefit for man."</p><p>"What are the ethers?"</p><p>"The ethers are the smells. Their presence determines the presence of an ether that nourishes not only the flesh but also the invisible component of the human being."</p><p>"I don't understand. You mean the brain?"</p><p>"You could say that the ethers strengthen thought energy and nourish the soul. These fruits were cultivated only on Russian homesteads, and their greatest benefit came when they were used on the day of harvest. So people came to Russia from different countries to try these fruits, among other reasons.</p><p>"What was cultivated on the homesteads immediately crowded out not only imported vegetables and fruits but also what grew on the big common fields. People began to understand and sense the difference in the quality of foods. Today's popular colas and other beverages were replaced by fruit drinks made from natural berries, and the most elite and expensive alcoholic beverages today could not withstand the competition with the beverages prepared on homesteads from natural berries.</p><p>"These beverages also contained beneficial ethers, since the people who prepared them on their homesteads took just a few minutes from the moment of the berries' harvest to put them in an infusion or liqueur.</p><p>"An even greater source of income for families living on their homesteads were medicinal plants, which they gathered in their woods, gardens, and nearby meadows.</p><p>"The harvests of medicinal herbs from Russia was preferred over the most expensive drugs manufactured in other countries. But this was true only for the combinations of medicinal herbs gathered on the homesteads, not those grown on specialized farms on big fields. An herb that grows in a big field among plants identical to it cannot take from the earth and air everything necessary and healthful for man. The output from a homestead cost several times more than the output cultivated by the so-called industrial method, but people all over the world still preferred it."</p><p>"Why did the homesteaders ratchet up the prices so much?"</p><p>"The lower limit was set by the Russian government."</p><p>"The government? But what does it care? It wasn't levying taxes on the sale of this output. Why is it trying to enrich each separate family?"</p><p>"But after all, Vladimir, the entire state is made up of individual families, which when necessary financed the building of infrastructure in their settlements—schools and roads, for example. Sometimes they invested money in statewide projects. Politicians and economists issued their own programs, but only those which people agreed to invest their money in went through."</p><p>"Which programs were considered most popular?"</p><p>"The purchase of chemical concerns outside Russia, weapons factories, and research centers."</p><p>"Now that's a change. You said that these families had acquired a divine awareness, goodness. The whole earth began to be transformed into a heavenly garden thanks to them, and here they're buying chemical and weapons businesses."</p><p>"The purpose of these projects was not to produce toxic chemicals and weapons but to eliminate the enterprises producing them. The Russian government was engaged in redirecting world financial streams. The money's energy that had cultivated what was lethal for humanity was now directed into eliminating what was lethal."</p><p>"So the Russian government had enough money for these extravagant projects?"</p><p>"Yes. Russia became not simply the richest country in the world, it became immeasurably richer than all the other countries. All the world's capital flowed into Russia. The rich and people of average means rushed to keep their capital only in Russian banks. Many of the wealthy simply bequeathed their savings to the development of Russian programs. They understood that humanity's future depended on implementing these programs. Foreign tourists who came to Russia, when they saw the new Russians, could no longer live by their former values. They spoke with admiration to their friends and acquaintances about what they had seen, and the stream of tourists increased and brought even more profit to the Russian state."</p><p>"Tell me, Anastasia, those people living in Siberia, what could they do to be as rich as the people in the central zone? After all, the summer in Siberia is shorter, and you're not going to get very rich from a garden cultivated there."</p><p>"People in Siberia also began setting up homesteads, Vladimir. The Siberians cultivated on their land what was adapted to their climate, but they also had a great advantage over people living in more southerly regions. The state allocated to Siberian families plots in the taiga, and each family took care of its parcels and gathered their gifts. Beneficial berries and herbs started coming in from Siberia. And cedar nut oil. . . ."</p><p>"How much does cedar oil cost abroad in dollars?"</p><p>"One metric ton is four million dollars."</p><p>"That's great. Finally they appreciated its worth, and the price rose eightfold compared to its old price. I wonder how much of this oil Siberians were manufacturing in a season?"</p><p>"In the year you're seeing now, three thousand tons of it were produced."</p><p>"Three thousand! That's twelve billion dollars they made just for gathering cedar nuts."</p><p>"More. You've forgotten that a marvelous flour is produced from the pressed nut."</p><p>"So how much income in dollars, at least on average, did a Siberian family have from their activities?"</p><p>"On average, three or four million dollars."</p><p>"Oh ho! And they weren't taxed either?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"So where could they use this money? When I was still working in Siberia, I saw in Siberian villages that anyone who wasn't lazy could support himself on hunting and fishing. And now this kind of big money."</p><p>"Like other Russians, they put their money into statewide programs. In the beginning, for example, when people in Russia still hadn't learned to adjust the movement of clouds, the Siberians spent a lot of money on buying airplanes."</p><p>"What do they need airplanes for?"</p><p>"To keep out clouds containing toxic precipitation. These clouds were formed in countries that still kept up their toxic production. The Siberians' aviation countered the effects."</p><p>"Did they also hunt only in the parcels of taigas assigned to them?"</p><p>"Siberians stopped hunting and killing animals altogether. Many of them built summer houses on their parcels where they settled in the summer, during the harvest of herbs, berries, mushrooms, and nuts. When they were still small, the newborn animals saw people doing them no harm, and they got used to them as a natural part of their territory and began to interact with and make friends with them. The Siberians taught many animals to help them. For example, the squirrels threw down cedar cones with ripe nuts, and this afforded the squirrels tremendous satisfaction. Some taught bears to haul baskets and sacks of nuts and to clear fallen trees."</p><p>"That's great. Even the bears started helping."</p><p>"Nothing surprising in that, Vladimir. In times modern men consider ancient, the bear was one of the most irreplaceable helpers in a household. It used its paws to dig up edible tubers, put them in a basket, and drag the basket by a rope to a root cellar dug out not far from man's home. The bear took buckets of honey from the trees growing in the forest and hauled them to man's home and led children into the forest for dainty raspberries and did much else around the homestead."</p><p>"That's great! So it replaced the plow and the tractor, brought in production, and was a nanny."</p><p>"And in the winter it slept, requiring no repairs or maintenance. In the spring, it came back to the man's home, and man treated the bear to the fruits of autumn."</p><p>"I see what's happening here with those bears. So their animal reflex was developed so they thought man was keeping his stores for them alone."</p><p>"Maybe a reflex, if that notion brings you clarity, but maybe that is what the Father intended. I will only say that the tubers were not the main thing for the bear in spring."</p><p>"Then what was?"</p><p>"After sleeping in his lair all winter in solitude, after waking in spring, the bear immediately rushed to man to feel his caress and hear his praise, since everything needs man's caress."</p><p>"Judging from dogs and cats, they do. But what did the other taiga beasts do?"</p><p>"Gradually a use was found for the taiga's other inhabitants. And the highest reward for the tame inhabitants of the territory was a kind word, gesture or petting, or scratching of the ones that especially distinguished themselves. Sometimes they were a little jealous, though, if man showed a preference for one of them, and they might quarrel over that."</p><p>"What did the Siberians do in the winter?"</p><p>"They processed the nuts. They did not husk the cones immediately after harvesting—the way it's done now to make them easier to transport—but kept the nuts in their resinous cones. This way the nuts could be kept for several years. Also, in winter, the women did handwork. For example, a handmade, hand-embroidered shirt woven from
 nettle fiber is very expensive now. The Siberians received people from different countries in winter and healed them."</p><p>"Anastasia, but if Russia became so blessed for the person residing in the region, that means many states should want to go to war with Russia, right? Not only that, you said that the arms factories were shut down. That means Russia basically became an agrarian country unprotected from any outside aggressor, right?"</p><p>"Russia did not turn into an agrarian country. It became a world scientific center.</p><p>"Russia started razing arms factories only after a kind of energy was discovered, against which all contemporary weapons were not just useless but presented a threat to the countries that kept them."</p><p>"What energy is this? How is it obtained, and who made its discovery?"</p><p>"The Atlantans possessed this energy. They discovered and used it too soon, and that is why Atlantis vanished from the face of the Earth. The children of the new Russia rediscovered it."</p><p>"The children? You'd better tell me everything as it happened, Anastasia."</p><p>"Fine."</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0509>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>9. May There be Good on the Earth</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>A friendly family lived on one of the Russian homesteads. This husband and wife had two children – a boy Konstantin, eight years old; and a girl Dasha, five. Their father was considered one of Russia's most talented programmers. There were several new-model computers in his study where he compiled programs for the military department. Sometimes, buried in work, he would sit at his computers in the evenings as well.</p><p>The members of his family, who were used to gathering in the evening, would go to his study and there each do something of their own. His wife would sit in an armchair and embroider. His son would read or draw, depicting the landscapes of the new settlements. Only five-year-old Dasha could not always find herself something pleasing to do, and then she would sit in an armchair in such a way that she could see all of her family and she would spend a long time closely examining each one. From time to time she would close her eyes and then her face expressed a gamut of emotions.</p><p>On that outwardly ordinary evening, the family sat in the father's study, where each was doing his own thing as always. The study door was open, so everyone heard the old cuckoo clock cuckooing from the children's bedroom, next to the father's study. Ordinarily the cuckoo only cuckooed during daylight hours, but it was already evening. So the father tore himself away from what he was doing and looked at the door, and the other members of the family looked in surprise at where the sound had just come from. Only little Dasha sat in her chair with her eyes closed and noticed nothing. A barely noticeable but frank smile played on her lips. Suddenly the cuckooing was repeated, as if someone were in the children's bedroom and moving the clock's hands, forcing the mechanized cuckoo to keep cuckooing, heralding the coming of the next hour. Ivan Nikiforovich, as the father of the family was called, turned his swivel chair toward his son and said,</p><p>"Kostya, please go try to stop the clock or fix it. Grandfather's gift has served us so many years. This is an odd breakdown. . . . Very odd. . . . Go try to sort it out, Kostya."</p><p>His children always obeyed. They did so not for fear of punishment because they were never punished. Kostya and Dasha loved and respected their parents. For them, it was the highest satisfaction to do something with them or carry out a parental request. Hearing his father's words, Kostya immediately stood up, but to his mother and father's amazement he did not go to his bedroom. He stood there looking at his younger sister sitting in the chair with closed eyes. The cuckooing came from the bedroom as before. But Kostya stood there and looked at his sister without tearing his eyes away.</p><p>Galina—the mother of the family—looked with concern at her son standing stock-still. Suddenly she stood up and shouted in fright, "Kostya. . . . "Kostya, what's the matter with you?"</p><p>Her eight-year-old son returned to his mother, surprised at her fright, and replied.</p><p>"I'm fine, dear mama, and I would like to carry out Papa's request but I can't."</p><p>"Why? You can't move a little? You can't go into your own room?"</p><p>"I can move"—as proof Kostya waved his arms and stamped his feet—"but there's no point going to my room. She's here and she's stronger."</p><p>"Who's here? Who's stronger?" His mother was getting more and more worried.</p><p>"Dasha," Kostya replied, and he pointed at his smiling younger sister, eyes still closed, sitting in the chair . "She's the one moving the clock's hands. I tried to put them back where they were, but I can't when she . . ."</p><p>"What are you saying, Kostenka? Both you and Dashenka are here in front of us, I can see you, so how can you be here and at the same time be moving the clock's hands in the other room?"</p><p>"Well yes, we're here," Kostya replied, "but our thought is there, where the clock is. Only her thought is stronger. So it cuckoos when her thought speeds up the hands. Lately she's been playing at this a whole lot. I told her not to do it. I knew you might get worried, but Dasha doesn't care. When she gets to thinking, she starts cooking up something. . . ."</p><p>"What is Dasha getting to thinking about?" Ivan Nikiforovich joined the conversation. "And why haven't you said anything about this to us before, Kostya?"</p><p>"You can see for yourself how she gets to thinking. The clock's hands aren't important, she's just entertaining herself this way. I can do it, too, move the clock's hands, when no one gets in my way. Only I can't think the way Dasha does. When she's deep in thought, her thoughts can't be stopped."</p><p>"What is Dasha thinking about? Kostya, do you know?"</p><p>"No. You'll have to ask her yourself. I'll interrupt her thinking now so she doesn't cook up something else."</p><p>Kostya walked over to the chair where his younger sister was sitting and said a little more loudly and distinctly than usual,</p><p>"Dasha, stop thinking. If you don't stop, I won't talk to you for a whole day. And anyway, you've frightened mama."</p><p>The little girl's eyelashes fluttered, she ran an appraising look over those present in the study, and as if waking up, jumped off the chair, apologized, and lowered her eyes. The cuckooing stopped, and for a while there was total silence in the study, a silence broken by little Dasha's quiet, apologetic voice. She raised her little head, looked at her mama and father with kind, shining eyes, and said,</p><p>"Dear Mama, dear Papa, I'm sorry if I frightened you. But I have to, I really really have to think it through. Now I can't not think it through. And tomorrow I will, after I rest." The little girl's lips were trembling, and she seemed just about to cry, but she went on: "Kostya, you aren't going to talk to me, but I'm still going to be thinking until I finish."</p><p>"Come to me, dear daughter," Ivan Nikiforovich, said, trying to restrain himself, and he held out his hands to his daughter, opening them for a hug.</p><p>Dasha ran to her father. She jumped into his lap and wrapped her little arms around her father's neck, pressed up to his cheek briefly, and then slipped off his lap and stood next to him, leaning her head toward him.</p><p>For some reason Ivan Nikiforovich had a hard time hiding his emotion, and he started speaking to his daughter:</p><p>"Don't be upset, Dashenka. Mama isn't afraid when you think anymore. Just tell us what you're thinking about. What is it you absolutely must finish thinking and why do the clock's hands move so quickly when you're thinking?</p><p>"Dear Papa, I want to make everything nice big in time and everything not nice small and unnoticeable or, basically, that's what I want to finish thinking, so that the clock's hands jump over what's not nice and it doesn't happen."</p><p>"But after all, everything that is and isn't nice doesn't depend on the clock's hands, Dashenka."</p><p>"Not on the hands, dear Papa. I understand it's not the hands. But I move them at the same time so I feel the time. The cuckoo marks off the speed of my thought because I need to finish in time. . . . And so I move the clock's hands."</p><p>"How do you do that, Dashenka?"</p><p>"It's simple. I imagine the clock's hands with the edge of my thought, and then I think they should move faster—and they do move faster when I start thinking fast."</p><p>"What do you want to achieve by moving time, dear daughter? What don't you like about what is?"</p><p>"I do like what is. I understood a long time ago that it's not time's fault. It's people themselves who spoil their own time. "You, dear Papa, often sit by your computer and then you go away for a long time. You, dear Papa, are spoiling time when you leave."</p><p>"Me? Spoiling it? In what way?"</p><p>"Good time is when we're together. When we're together there are very good minutes and hours and even days. Then everything around us rejoices. Remember, dear Papa, when the apple tree was only just starting to blossom a little? You and Mama saw the first little flowers, and you took Mama's hands and spun her. And Mama laughed like a bell so that everything around her rejoiced, the leaves and birds. And I wasn't hurt at all. Because you took Mama in your hands and not me and spun her, because I love our Mama very much. I rejoiced at the time along with everyone. But then another time came. Now I understand that it's you, dear Papa, who made it different. You left us for a very long time. Little apples had started appearing on the tree even. You still weren't here. Mama would walk up to the apple tree and stand there alone. But no one spun her, and she didn't laugh like a bell, and there was nothing for everyone around to rejoice in. Mama has a completely different smile when you're gone. A sad smile. And that's a bad time."</p><p>Dasha spoke
 quickly and emotionally. All of a sudden she fell silent and then she blurted out:</p><p>"You shouldn't make it worse when it's good. . . . Time. . . . Papa dear!"</p><p>"Dasha. . . . In a way you're right . . . Of course. . . . But you still don't know everything about the time in which we all . . . The time we live in. . . ." Ivan Nikiforovich said in a confused way.</p><p>He was upset. Somehow he needed to explain the necessity of his trips. Explain it comprehensibly for his little daughter. And finding nothing better, he began telling her about his work, showing the missile plans and models on his computer.</p><p>"You have to understand, Dashenka. It's nice for us here, of course, and it's nice for those who live near us, too. But there are other places, other countries, in the world, and there are all kinds of different weapons there. In order to protect our beautiful orchard, and the orchards and homes of your friends, the papas go away sometimes. Our country has to have lots of modern weapons, too, to defend itself. And recently . . . Dashenka . . . You understand, recently, in another country, not ours, they came up with a new weapon. Right now it's stronger than ours. Look here at the screen, Dashenka." Ivan Nikiforovich pressed a key and the picture of an unusually shaped missile appeared on the screen.</p><p>"This is a big missile, and it has fifty-six small missiles on its hull. The big missile flies up at someone's command and heads for the indicated point in order to destroy everything living at that point. This missile is also very hard to knock down. If any object gets close to it, its onboard computer starts working and one of the small missiles separates from the hull and destroys the object.</p><p>"The little rocket's speed is greater than the big one's, since it uses at the start the inertia of the big one. In order to knock down just one such monster, you have to send fifty-seven missiles against it. In the country that manufactured this so-called cassette missile, there are still only three prototypes so far. They're carefully hidden in different places, in mines deep underground, but on a command transmitted by radio waves, they can soar up. A small group of terrorists is already blackmailing several countries, threatening them with major devastation. I'm supposed to figure out the program of the cassette missile's onboard computer, Dashenka."</p><p>Ivan Nikiforovich stood up and started pacing around the room. He continued speaking quickly, plunging more and more into his thoughts about the program, as if forgetting about his daughter standing by the computer. Ivan Nikiforovich walked over quickly to the monitor where the external view of the missile was depicted and clicked the keyboard—and on the screen appeared the scheme for the missile complex's fuel line, then the scheme of the locator installations, and then the overall view again. As he changed the image, Ivan Nikiforovich was no longer paying attention to his little girl. He was reasoning out loud:</p><p>"They've obviously equipped each segment with a location device. Yes, of course, each one. But the program can't be different. The program is identical. . . .</p><p>Suddenly the computer next to that one sounded an alarm, demanding immediate attention. Ivan Nikiforovich turned toward the monitor of the computer standing next to him and fell still. A text message was flashing on the monitor over and over, with the following content: "Alarm X," "Alarm X." Ivan Nikiforovich quickly clicked the keyboard and on screen appeared the image of a man in military uniform.</p><p>"What happened?" Ivan Nikiforovich asked him.</p><p>"Three unusual explosions have been registered," the man replied. "The command has been given to put the entire defense complex on level-one readiness. Less powerful explosions are continuing. There's been an earthquake in Africa. No one is issuing any explanations whatsoever. According to information exchange data, all the planet's military blocs have been moved to level-one readiness. The attacking side has not been determined. The explosions are continuing and we are attempting to clarify the situation. All employees of our department have been ordered to proceed to an analysis of the situation," the man on the monitor spoke quickly and with military precision, and at the end he added, no longer coolly but with a certain concern:</p><p>"The explosions are continuing, Ivan Nikiforovich, the explosions are continuing, I'm signing off."</p><p>The image of the man in uniform disappeared from the monitor screen, and Ivan Nikiforovich continued to look at the extinguished screen and think tensely. Slowly, pondering, he turned toward his chair, where little Dasha was still standing, and he shivered at his own incredible conjecture. Here was his little girl, squinting, not blinking, looking at the monitor with the depiction of the modern missile. Suddenly her little body shuddered, Dasha heaved a relieved sigh, she pushed "Enter," and when the depiction of a new missile appeared she once again squinted and began looking hard at it.</p><p>Ivan Nikiforovich stood there as if paralyzed, unable to move from his spot, and feverishly kept asking himself the same question: "She isn't really exploding them, is she? Exploding them with her thought because she doesn't like them? She's exploding them? Really? How?" He wanted to stop his daughter and called to her, but he was unable to say the words loudly. He could only whisper, "Dasha, Dashenka, my little girl, stop!" Observing this whole scene, Kostya suddenly stood up quickly, ran up to his little sister, gave her a light slap on her bottom, and said:</p><p>"Dasha, this way you've scared Papa now, too. And Now I'm not going to talk to you for two days. One day for Mama, the other for Papa. Do you hear? Do you hear? I'm telling you, you're scaring Papa."</p><p>Slowly emerging from her concentration, Dasha turned toward her brother and now, not squinting but imploringly and apologetically looked him in the eyes. Kostya saw Dasha's tear-filled eyes. He put his hand on her little shoulder and said, less sternly than before. "All right, I got worked up with what I said, but now you're going to be tying your own ribbons in the morning. You're not a little girl." And with the words, "Just don't think about crying," he gently hugged Dasha. The girl pressed her little face into Kostya's chest, her little shoulders started shaking, and she kept repeating bitterly. "I frightened someone again. I'm unbearable. I wanted to do what was best, and I frightened him." Galina went over to her children, squatted, and stroked Dasha's head. The little girl immediately threw herself on her mother's neck and started crying softly.</p><p>"How does she do this, Kostya? How?" Ivan Nikiforovich asked his son after he came around.</p><p>"The same way as with the hands on the clock, Papa," Kostya replied.</p><p>"But the clock is right nearby, and the missiles are far away, and their location is held in strictest secret."</p><p>"Papa, Dasha doesn't care where they are. She just has to see the object's external shape."</p><p>"But the explosions. . . . In order to explode them you have to close the contacts. . . . And not just one. There's security, after all, codes. . . ."</p><p>"Papa, Dasha connects all the contacts until there is a short. It used to be it took her a very long time, fifteen minutes or so, but lately it's been about a minute and a half."</p><p>"Used to be?"</p><p>"Yes, Papa, only not with missiles. We used to play like that. When she started moving the clock hands, I showed her the old electric cart I liked to ride in when I was little. Papa, I opened the hood and asked her to connect the wires to the lights because it was hard for me to get to them myself. And she did. And when she asked to go for a ride, I said she was still little and couldn't, how you have to turn it on and brake, and then I agreed because she insisted. I explained how you were supposed to turn it on, but Dasha did it all her own way. Papa, Dasha got in, took the wheel, and started off without turning anything on. She thought she had, but I saw and she didn't do anything with her hands. Or rather, she turned it on, but she did it mentally. And also, Papa, she's friends with microbes. They obey her."</p><p>"Microbes? What kind of microbes?"</p><p>"The kind there are so many of, that live everywhere, around us and in us. You can't see them, but they're there. Remember, Papa, at the edge of our homestead, in the forest, the metal supports from the old high-voltage electric lines poking up out of the ground?"</p><p>"Yes, and so?"</p><p>"They were rusty and on a concrete base. When Dasha went mushroom picking, she saw these remains and said how bad it was that they kept the berries and mushrooms from growing. Then she said, "You have to eat them up quickly, very quickly."</p><p>"And what happened?"</p><p>"Two days later these rusty remains and the concrete base were gone. Just bare earth, no grass at the time. . . . The microbes ate up the metal and concrete."</p><p>"But why? Why didn't you tell me before about all this that was happening with Dasha, Kostya?</p><p>"I was afraid, Papa."</p><p>"Of what?"</p><p>"I've read in history . . . In the recent past, they tried to isolate people with unusual abilities. I wanted to tell you and Mama everything, but I couldn't find the words to make you understand and believe."</p><p>"Kostya, we always believe you, and not only that but you could have demonstrated to us . . . Or rather, you could have asked Dasha to demonstrate her abilities for us on something harmless."</p><p>"That's not what I was afraid of, Papa. She might have demonstrated . . ." Kostya fell silent, and when he began to speak his voice was agitated. "Papa, I love you and Mama. . . . Sometimes I am strict with Dashenka, but I love her very much, too. She's good. Dasha is good to everything around her. She wouldn't harm a bug. Nor they her. She went up to a beehive, sat down right by the hive entrance, and watched them fly. The bees.
 . . . Lots of bees crawled over her arms, legs, and cheek, but they didn't sting. Dashenka held out her palm to the bees and they would land on it and leave something behind. Then she would lick her palm and laugh. She's good, Papa."</p><p>"Calm down, Kostya. Don't get upset. Let's assess the situation calmly. Yes, we need to think it all through calmly. . . . Dasha is still a child. She blew up several modern missile complexes. She could have started a world war. A terrible war. But even without a war . . . If she'd looked through pictures of our missiles and not just our enemy's. If all the missiles in all countries started blowing up, the world could find itself on the bring of total disaster. Hundreds of millions of lives could be lost. I love our little Dasha, too. But millions. . . . We have to consult. We have to find a solution. But for now. I don't know. . . . Dashenka has to be isolated somehow. Somehow. . . . Yes. She might have to be put into a hypnotic sleep for a while. She might. . . . But what is the solution? What other solution can be found?"</p><p>"Papa, Papa . . . wait up. Maybe we could remove all the lethal missiles, which she doesn't like, from the earth."</p><p>"Remove them? But . . . That would require consent by all countries. All military blocs. Yes. . . . But that can't be achieved quickly, if at all. And for now . . ."</p><p>Ivan Nikiforovich quickly walked over to the computer which showed the missile they had kept Dasha from destroying. He turned off the monitor, moved over to the communications computer keyboard, and started transmitting text: "To headquarters. This message must be disseminated immediately to all military blocs and international media. The reason for the series of explosions of missile complexes are bacteria capable of closing the contacts. They are controllable. All pictures of armaments capable of exploding must be destroyed. All! From the smallest bullet to the most modern missile complex. The person who controls the bacteria does not need to know the location of the explosive site; all he needs is to see its shape in a picture!"</p><p>Ivan Nikiforovich looked at a now smiling Dasha chatting animatedly with her mama and added the following text to his message: "The location of the installation controlling the explosions is unknown." Ivan Nikiforovich went on to send an encoded message to headquarters.</p><p>The next morning there was an emergency session of Russia's Military Council. Protection was organized around the settlement where Ivan Nikiforovich's homestead was located. The guards tried to be discreet, and the soldiers wore road worker uniforms.</p><p>Five kilometers from the settlement, on its outskirts, they allegedly began building a ring road, "building" at every meter simultaneously, day and night. Television cameras were installed at Ivan Nikiforovich's homestead to follow every minute of little Dasha's life. The picture was transmitted to a center resembling a space flight mission control center. Tens of specialists, psychologists, and military personnel prepared to give the necessary instructions in the event of an emergency kept continuous vigil at the monitors. Specialist psychologists, with the help of a special link, were constantly giving little Dasha's parents recommendations about how to distract her with something to keep her from falling into contemplation again.</p><p>The Russian government made an international statement that seemed odd to many which said that there were forces in Russia capable of exploding any type of armament, no matter where they were. These forces were not wholly under the control of the Russian government, but talks were being held with them. The unlikelihood of this statement demanded confirmation. An international council decided to manufacture a series of unusually shaped projectiles. They were manufactured with square cartridge cases. Each of the countries participating in the experiment took twenty of these projectiles and hid them in different places on their territory.</p><p>"But why did they make the projectiles with square cartridge cases? Why couldn't they use ordinary ones?" I asked Anastasia.</p><p>"Vladimir, they were afraid that not only all existing projectiles in the world might blow up but also the bullets in the magazines of police and military guns, everyone carrying a weapon with ammunition."</p><p>"Yes, of course. . . . And how did the experiment with square projectiles go?"</p><p>Ivan Nikiforovich called his little daughter Dasha into his study, showed her the photograph of the square projectile, and asked her to blow them up.</p><p>Dasha looked at the photograph and said,</p><p>"I love you very much, Papa dear, but I can't carry out your request."</p><p>"Why?" Ivan Nikiforovich was amazed.</p><p>"Because it won't work."</p><p>"Why won't it, Dashenka? It did before. You blew a whole series of modern missiles, but now it won't?"</p><p>"I was so upset then, Papa dear. I didn't want you to go away and sit so many hours at your computer. When you sit at your computer you don't talk to anyone and don't do anything interesting. But now you're always nearby. You've become very good, dear Papa, so I can't make anything explode."</p><p>Ivan Nikiforovich realized that Dasha was incapable of blowing up the square projectiles because the goal of blowing them up, the point, wasn't clear to her." Ivan Nikiforovich paced agitatedly around his study, thinking feverishly about how to find a solution. He began heatedly trying to convince Dasha. He talked to his daughter as if he were reasoning with himself:</p><p>"It won't work. . . . Yes. . . . That's too bad. There have been wars in the world for millennia. Wars ended between some, and others started to fight. Millions of people died then and are dying now. Huge amounts of money are spent on weapons. There was an opportunity to put a stop to this endless, destructive process, but unfortunately . . ." Ivan Nikiforovich looked at Dasha sitting in the chair.</p><p>His daughter's face was calm. She watched with interest as he paced around his study and spoke. But the meaning of the words uttered did not upset Dasha. She did not completely realize what war was, what kind of money he was talking about, and who was spending it.</p><p>She was thinking her own thoughts: "Why is Papa pacing around his study so upset among the unkind computers, which don't give out any energy? Why doesn't he want to go out into the orchard, where the trees are blooming and the birds are singing, where every blade of grass and every twig on the tree caresses your whole body with something invisible? Mama and my brother Kostya are there now. I hope Papa stops this boring talk so we can go out into the orchard together. When Mama and Kostya see them, they'll be so happy. Mama will smile, and yesterday Kostya promised to tell me how you can touch a distant star by touching a pebble or a flower. Kostya always keeps his promises."</p><p>"Dashenka, am I boring you? Do you not understand what I've said?" Ivan Nikiforovich addressed his daughter. "Are you thinking your own thoughts?"</p><p>"Papa dear, I'm thinking, why are you and I here and not in the orchard where everything is waiting for us?"</p><p>Ivan Nikiforovich realized he needed to speak more sincerely and specifically with his daughter. So he began:</p><p>"Dashenka, when you blew up the missiles by looking at their picture, the idea was born to verify your abilities one more time. Or rather, to show the whole world Russia's ability to destroy all the armaments in the world. Then there would be no point producing them. No point and dangerous. People themselves would destroy those already made. Universal disarmament would begin. The square projectiles were manufactured specially so that you could demonstrate your abilities without anyone dying in the process. Blow them up, Dashenka."</p><p>"I can't do that now, Papa dear."</p><p>"Why? You could before and now you can't."</p><p>"I promised myself never to blow anything up again. And since I promised, I don't have the ability to blow anything up now."</p><p>"You don't? But why did you promise yourself?"</p><p>"Brother Kostya showed me pictures in his book of how people's bodies fly to pieces from explosions, how people are scared of explosions, how trees fall and die from explosions, so I promised myself. . . ."</p><p>"Dashenka, does that mean you can never do it now? Even just one more time? Just one. These square projectiles here."</p><p>Ivan Nikiforovich held out a photograph of the square projectile to his daughter.</p><p>"They were manufactured especially and hidden in secluded places in different countries. There aren't any people next to them or even nearby. Everyone is waiting to see whether or not they'll blow up. Blow them up, daughter. This will not be breaking your promise. No one will perish. On the contrary . . ."</p><p>Dasha looked at the photograph of the square projectile again indifferently and replied calmly,</p><p>"If I take back my promise, those projectiles still won't blow up, Papa dear."</p><p>"But why?"</p><p>"Because you talk too much, Papa dear. And when I looked at the photograph, I immediately disliked these square goblins. They're ugly and now . . ."</p><p>"What now? Dashenka . . . What?"</p><p>"Forgive me, please, Papa dear, but you talked so much after you showed them to me that since then they've been almost entirely eaten up."</p><p>"Eaten up? What's been eaten up?"</p><p>"These square projectiles are nearly eaten up. As soon as I didn't like the projectiles I could tell—they'd been set in motion and started eating them very very fast."</p><p>"Who are 'they'?"</p><p>"Oh, the little ones. They're around us everywhere and inside us. They're good. Kostya says they're bacteria, or microorganisms. But I'd rather call them 'my nice little ones.' They like that more. Sometimes I play with them. People pay almost no attention to them, but they always try to do something good for each person. When a person rejoices, the joyous energy makes him feel good; when a person is angry or breaks something living, they perish in
 great numbers. Others rush to take the place of those who have perished. Sometimes others do not manage to replace the dead, and the human body falls ill.</p><p>"But you are here, Dashenka, and the missiles are hidden far away underground in different countries. How could they, well, these 'little ones,' learn of your desire so quickly in other countries?"</p><p>"Oh, they tell each other everything in a chain, a lot faster than the electrons run in your computer."</p><p>"My computer . . . Communication . . . Just a second . . . I'm going to verify everything. Video cameras have been installed around every missile on our territory. I'll be just a second."</p><p>Ivan Nikiforovich turned toward his communication computer. The image of a square projectile glowed on the monitor. Or rather, what was left of the projectile. The cartridge case was rusty and full of holes, and the warhead was lying nearby and significantly smaller. Ivan Nikiforovich switched screens, but the same thing had happened to the other projectiles. The image of a man in military uniform appeared on the screen.</p><p>"Hello, Ivan Nikiforovich. You yourself have already seen everything."</p><p>"What conclusions has the Council drawn?" Ivan Nikiforovich asked.</p><p>"The Council members have divided up into groups and are consulting. Security is trying to work out additional safety measures for the site."</p><p>"Don't call my daughter a site."</p><p>"You're nervous, Ivan Nikiforovich, and in this situation that is impermissible. In ten minutes, an expert group consisting of leading specialists, psychologists, biologists, and radio electronics specialists will be joining you. They are already en route. Set up the communication with your daughter. Prepare her."</p><p>"What opinion are most of the Council members inclining toward?"</p><p>"For now, toward your family's total isolation within the bounds of your homestead. You must immediately clear out all images of technical devices. Remain by your daughter's side and try to keep a constant watch on her."</p><p>The group of specialists from the Military Council who arrived at Ivan Nikiforovich's homestead spoke with little Dasha for an hour and a half. The child patiently answered the adults' questions, but after an hour and a half something happened that completely confused all the specialists present at the homestead and all those observing what was happening from the Security Council center on huge monitors. After an hour and a half of talking with little Dasha, the door of Ivan Nikiforovich's expansive study opened. Dasha's brother Kostya walked into the study. He was carrying the cuckoo clock, which was cuckooing continuously. Kostya put the clock on the desk. The clock's hands were at eleven, and when the mechanical cuckoo was supposed to finish the specific number of cuckoos, the big hand of the clock quickly circled the clock face and the cuckoo started over from the beginning. In silence, those present looked at the clock's bizarre movements and then Dasha, baffled.</p><p>"Oy," Dasha suddenly exclaimed. "I completely forgot. I have to go take care of something important. It's my friend, Verunka, who's spinning the hands. That's what we agreed. If I forgot. I have to go."</p><p>Two guards blocked the exit from the study.</p><p>"What will you forget, Dashenka?" Ivan Nikiforovich asked his daughter.</p><p>"I forgot to go to the homestead where my friend Verunka lives and stroke her little flower and water it. Otherwise it's sad without caressing. It likes to be looked at tenderly."</p><p>"But the flower isn't yours, after all," Ivan Nikiforovich commented to his daughter. "Why can't your friend stroke it herself? Her own flower?"</p><p>"Papa dear, Verunka and her parents went on a visit."</p><p>"A visit where?"</p><p>"Somewhere in Siberia."</p><p>Exclamations by those present, uttered nearly in a whisper, were heard on all sides.</p><p>"She's not the only one!"</p><p>"What abilities does your friend have?"</p><p>"She's not the only one!"</p><p>"How many are there?"</p><p>"How can they be determined?"</p><p>"We must take immediate measures for each such child!"</p><p>All the exclamations subsided as soon as an elderly, graying man sitting at the edge rose from his seat. This man was senior in rank and position not only among the people present in Ivan Nikiforovich's study. He was chairman of the Russian Security Council. Everyone turned toward him and fell silent. The gray-haired man looked at Dasha sitting in her little wooden armchair and a tiny tear rolled down his cheek. Then the gray-haired man slowly walked up to Dasha, dropped to one knee before her, and reached out to her. Dasha stood up, took a step, and picking up the hem of her skirt, dropped a curtsey and put her little hand in his palm. The gray-haired man looked at her for a while, then bowed his head, and respectfully kissing Dasha's hand, said,</p><p>"Forgive us, please, little goddess."</p><p>"My name is Dasha," the little girl replied.</p><p>"Yes, of course, your name is Dasha. Tell us, what must be on our Earth?"</p><p>The little girl looked with surprise into the elderly man's face, drew close to him, cautiously wiped the little tear from his face with her palm, and touched his mustache with her finger. Then she turned toward her brother.</p><p>"Kostya, you promised to help me be with the lilies in Verunka's pond. Do you remember your promise?"</p><p>"Yes," Kostya answered.</p><p>"Then let's go."</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>Dasha stopped at the doorway after passing the guards, who had parted before her, turned to the man still kneeling on one knee, smiled at him, and said confidently,</p><p>"What must be on Earth . . . is goodness!"</p><p>Six hours later, speaking at an expanded session of the Russian Security Council, the gray-haired chairman said,</p><p>"Everything in the world is relative. Relative to our generation, the new one is akin to gods. We must come even with it, not it with us. All the military might of the planet, with its unique technical achievements, proved powerless before this one little girl of the new generation. Our task, our duty, and our obligation before this new generation is to clear away the trash. We must apply all our efforts toward clearing the Earth of all weaponry. Our technical achievements and the discoveries embodied in the most modern and, as we thought, unique military complexes turned out to be unnecessary junk in the face of the new generation, and we have to clear it away."</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0510>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>10. The Disarmament Race</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>An international conference was held for the security councils of the military blocs of the different countries and continents. There, plans were worked out for the emergency recycling of military equipment and ammunition. Scientists from different countries exchanged their experience in recycling technologies. Psychologists spoke constantly in the media, trying to avert a panic among the populace, which owned various types of firearms. Panic arose after news of the Russian phenomenon was leaked to the media. The facts were somewhat distorted.</p><p>Several Western news sources spoke about how Russia was recycling the ammunition on its territory on an emergency basis and was preparing at x-hour to blow up the military reserves of other countries, destroying in the process the majority of the population. People started throwing the firearms and ammunition they had into the rivers and burying them in wastelands because official recycling depots could not accept them from those who wanted to turn them in.</p><p>Fines were set for unauthorized recycling. Middleman firms took large payment for accepting each cartridge, but this did not stop those who wanted to from getting rid of what presented a threat to the lives of entire families. The people of cities located close to military bases demanded that the authorities immediately eliminate military sites. But the defense industry, which had been refocused to recycle what it had previously produced, was working at the limit of its capacity as it was. The press of many Western countries began to spread more and more rumors about how Russia was threatening the world with disaster. The world could not get rid of its accumulated weapons, and many enterprises recycling military arms and ammunition were working at the limit of their capacity. They could not destroy the weapons produced over decades in just a few months.</p><p>The Russian government was accused of allegedly knowing for a long time about these unusual children and of preparing well beforehand to recycle lethal weapons. To confirm these rumors, the fact was cited that the Russian government had engaged in buying up and disassembling ecologically unreliable enterprises not only in its own country but those in countries close to Russia's borders. If Russia was the first to clear its territory of explosive weapons, it would have the opportunity to destroy countries lagging in the disarmament race.</p><p>They intentionally exaggerated all the possible devastation and consequences of a world catastrophe. Firms that recycled ammunition found this very profitable, since the price for their services rose. For example, someone turning in gun cartridges for recycling had to pay twenty dollars per cartridge. Unauthorized burial or disposal of a weapon was viewed as an act of sabotage. Panic was also mounting because no one could propose effective protection from the powers discovered in Russian children. The Russian president agreed to what everyone then thought to be a desperate and ill-considered step. He decided to appear live on air over all channels of world television, surrounded by children with unusual abilities. When the day and time of the Russian president's live appearance was announced, nearly the entire population of the planet gathered by their television screens. Just ahead of this hour, many enterprises stopped work, stores closed, and the streets were deserted: people awaited the news from Russia.
 The Russian president wanted to use his appearance to reassure people and to show the whole world that the generation of Russians being born were not blood-thirsty monsters but good, ordinary children, and there was no need to fear them. In order to be more convincing, the Russian president asked his assistants to assemble in his office about thirty children with unusual abilities and decided to remain alone in the office with those children. Everything was done in just this way.</p><p>"What did the Russian president tell the world community?"</p><p>"If you like you can see this scene for yourself and hear what was said, Vladimir."</p><p>"Yes, I would like that."</p><p>"Watch."</p><p>Russia's president stood at a small podium next to his desk. Children of different ages from about three to ten sat on little chairs on either side of the podium. Near the opposite wall of the office were journalists with television cameras. The president began to speak.</p><p>"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow citizens! I have invited you especially to meet the children. As you yourself will be convinced, I am in this office with them alone, without a guard, psychologists, or parents. These children are not the monsters many media in the West have attempted to portray. You yourselves can see that these are ordinary children. Their faces and actions show no signs of aggressiveness. We consider some of their abilities unusual. But is that, in fact, the case? The abilities that have begun to be discovered in the new generation may be ordinary for the human individual. What may be unusual and unacceptable for human existence are our creations. The human community has created a system of communications and military potential capable of leading our planet to catastrophe.</p><p>"Over the centuries, peace talks have been held between the states with the greatest military power, but the arms race has not stopped. Today there is a real opportunity to put an end to this endless, destructive process. Right now, those countries where lethal weapons are not concentrated are in the most advantageous position. For us, this position appears unnatural. But let's think hard about why we so deeply believe that the production of lethal weaponry threatening entire nations with man's annihilation is natural.</p><p>"The new generation has changed its priorities and forced us to move in the opposite direction, to disarm. The fear, panic, and fevered actions that are accompanying this process have been created largely thanks to the distortions of the news. The Russian government has been accused of long knowing about the appearance in its country of children with unusual abilities. These accusations are groundless. Russia still has a lot of military potential, and like many countries, we are doing everything possible to recycle it.</p><p>"The Russian government has been accused of not trying to discover all the children with unusual abilities and not taking actions to isolate them, which implies forcible hypnotism until the disarmament process is complete. The Russian government will not agree to this step. Russia's children are full-fledged citizens of our country. Let us think about this desire to isolate those who do not accept the weapons of murder rather than those who produce them. The Russian government is taking measures to avert an accidental emotional outburst among children capable of sending an impulse and blowing up a type of weapon they dislike.</p><p>"Films displaying killing weapons have been completely banned from Russian television channels. Toys that imitate weapons have been destroyed. Their parents are by their children's side constantly and try to ward off their negative reaction. Russia—"</p><p>The president broke off his speech. A tow-headed boy of five or so stood up and walked toward a tripod supporting a video camera. First he simply examined the tripod's screws and when he grabbed them, the operator abandoned his camera and retreated behind the journalists' backs in fright. The president quickly walked up to the boy who had frightened the cameraman, took his hand, and led him to the chair where he had been sitting quietly before, murmuring as they went, "Please, sit quietly until I finish."</p><p>But he was unable to continue his speech. Two children of three or four were doing something with the communications equipment near the desk. The children, who had been sitting quietly since the beginning of the speech, scattered through the office and did different things. Only the older children, and there were very few of them, sat in their places examining the journalists and television cameras. Among them was a girl with ribbons in her braids, and I recognized her. Dasha, who had blown up modern missile complexes, assessing what was going on in a very unchildishly intelligent and careful way, was observing the journalists' reactions.</p><p>People glued to their television screens all over the world saw the Russian president's slightly distraught face. He looked at the children scattered through his office. He saw two children doing something with the government cameras and looked at the door outside of which his assistants and the invited children's parents were but did not call to anyone for help. The president apologized for his interrupted speech, quickly walked up to two children who were dragging one of the devices off his desk, picked them up under the arms, and said, "These are not your toys." One of the boys who found himself behind held up by the president saw his pal hanging from the president's other side and laughed gaily. The second child, squirming, tugged on the president's tie and said, "They are!"</p><p>"That's what you think, but they aren't."</p><p>"They're toys," the smiling child repeated merrily.</p><p>The president saw a few more children, attracted by the blinking colored lights and sound, walk up and start touching the telephone receivers. Then he put the two fidgeters down on the floor, walked quickly to his desk, pressed a button, and said, "Immediately turn off all communications in my office."</p><p>Then he quickly spread out blank pieces of paper on his desk. He put a pencil or pen on each and said, turning to the kids crowding around him. "Here you go. You can draw whatever you want. Draw, and then we'll all look and see whose turned out the best."</p><p>The children surrounded the desk to take paper and pencils or pens. The shorter ones couldn't reach the desk, so the president began pulling up chairs and sitting or standing the little ones on the chairs. Convinced that he had distracted the children with drawing, the president once again walked up to his podium, smiled at the television viewers, gathered air into his lungs, intending to continue his speech, and couldn't. A little boy walked up to him and started tugging at his trousers.</p><p>"What's this? What do you need?"</p><p>"Pee . . ." the child said.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Pee . . . pee pee."</p><p>"You mean you need to go to the bathroom?"—and the president looked at the office door again.</p><p>The door opened, and two of the president's assistants or guards quickly rushed to him. One of the men, with a stern and somewhat tense face, leaned over and took the child by the hand. But the child, not letting go of the president's trouser leg, squirmed away, jerked his hand out of that of the stern man pulling him out of the office, and made a gesture of protest toward the other men approaching. The men who had come in were at a loss. The child raised his little face again, and looking up at the president tugged at his trousers again and said, "Pee"—and he squatted a little.</p><p>"You've picked a bad time with your 'pee.' And you're also very hard to please," the president said, quickly picking the child up in his arms and apologizing to the journalists, and headed to the door, saying as he went, "We'll be quick," and he walked out.</p><p>On the screens of hundreds of millions of televisions, the television cameras showed the children playing, drawing, and talking to each other. Most often they showed the president's podium, where no one stood. And then, little Dasha rose from her seat. She took her chair, dragged it to the presidential podium, climbed on the chair, looked at the journalists and into the camera lenses aimed at her, straightened the bows on her braids, and began to speak.</p><p>"My name is Dasha. Our president is a nice man. He'll be right back. He'll be back and he'll tell you everything. He's a little nervous. But he'll be able to tell everyone how good it's going to be everywhere on Earth and that no one should be afraid of us. My brother Kostya told me that people are afraid of us children now because I blew up the big new missiles. But I didn't just want to blow them up, I wanted to keep my papa from leaving us for long times and for my papa not to think so much about these missiles and not to look at them. He should look at Mama. She's better than all the missiles. She's so happy when Papa looks at her and talks to her. But when he goes away for a long time or looks at missiles, Mama is sad, and I don't want my mama to be sad. Kostya, my brother, is very smart and sensible, and Kostya says I've scared lots of people. I won't blow anything up anymore. That's not interesting at all. There are other things to do that are very important and interesting. They will bring joy to everyone. And you will take apart the missiles yourselves. So that no one can ever blow them up. Please don't be afraid of us.</p><p>"Come visit us. All of you. We'll give you all life-giving water to drink. My mama told me how people here used to live. They went about their business, built different factories and plants, and got so carried away that all of a sudden there was no life-giving water left. The water got dirty, and they only sold water in bottles in stores. But the water in bottles is dead, suffocated, and people started getting sick. That was how it used to be, but I just couldn't imagine how people could pollute
 the water they themselves were drinking. But my papa said that even now on Earth there were whole countries where there wasn't any living, clean water, and people in those countries were dying from agonizing diseases. There aren't any apples in those countries, or delicious berries, because everything living is sick, and a person who eats something sick suffers.</p><p>"You should come visit us all, come visit. And we'll treat you to apples that aren't sick, and tomatoes, and pears, and berries. You'll try them, and when you go home you'll tell yourselves, We shouldn't pollute, it's better to live in cleanliness. Then, when you have everything clean, we'll come visit you with presents."</p><p>The president, who had returned carrying the little boy, was standing in the door and listening to Dasha speak. And when she fell silent, he walked up to the podium, still holding the child, who was comfortable in his arms, and added, "Yes, of course. . . . You should come, indeed, you can heal your flesh here. But this is not the main thing. More important is for us all to understand ourselves and our purpose. We must understand this so we aren't cleared off the face of the Earth like trash. Together we must all clean up after ourselves, clear away the dirt we've created. Thank you all for your attention."</p><p>The scene in the president's office disappeared. And Anastasia's voice continued:</p><p>"It's hard to say whether the president's speech or little Dasha's had an influence on the people listening to the live broadcast from Russia. But people didn't want to believe the rumors being spread about Russia's aggressiveness anymore. People wanted to live, and to live happily, and they believed in that possibility. Those wanting to visit Russia and spend time there increased many times after the direct broadcast from the Kremlin. Those who returned from Russia could no longer live their former life. An awareness blazed up in each of them, like the first ray of sun in the morning's dawn.</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0511>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>11. Science and Pseudoscience</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>"Anastasia, how could Russians receive such a large number of visitors? That must have been hard for them. I can imagine you and your family on your homestead, with a crowd of gawkers staring at you over the fence every minute."</p><p>"The tourists and foreigners who came to Russia for treatment were settled in the cities, in the now-free apartments. Food was supplied from the homesteads, and the tourists were not taken there. Only a few were able to visit where the new Russians had taken up permanent residence. Psychologists were constantly warning homestead owners that the people who had come, especially from countries previously considered highly developed, would suffer a psychic breakdown from their hospitality. What the psychologists said corresponded to the truth. Upon their return home, approximately forty percent of the foreigners who visited homesteads suffered from depression that bordered on suicidal."</p><p>"How could that be? Why? You were the one who said that everything was wonderful on the homesteads, Anastasia: the surrounding landscape, the food, the mutual understanding within families."</p><p>"That's all true, but for many foreign visitors what they saw was too wonderful. Imagine, Vladimir, an elderly person who has lived most of his life in a big city. The person has tried to earn as much money as possible, no matter what, so that he could, according to his lights, be as good as anyone else. In exchange for money he got housing, clothing, a car, and food. He sits in his furnished apartment, his automobile is parked in the garage, and he has food in the refrigerator."</p><p>"Well, he imagined everything was fine, so what next?"</p><p>"Why don't you yourself answer your own question, Vladimir? What next?"</p><p>"Next . . . Maybe this person will go somewhere and maybe buy new furniture or a car."</p><p>"And then?"</p><p>"Then? I don't know what then."</p><p>"Then this man will die. He will die forever or for millions of earth years. His second I, his soul, cannot acquire an earthly plane of being again. It cannot because in his life he never created anything good for the earth. Each person understands this intuitively, and this is why people fear death. When most people have the same aspirations and a similar way of life, they believe that this is the only and necessary way to live—like everyone else. But here the man has seen a completely different life on earth. He has seen an earthly paradise, a dimension of Love created in the Divine image by human hand, and he believes his life to be over and spent in hell. A man like that dies in agony, and his torments last millions of years."</p><p>"But why doesn't everyone who has seen the Russians' new way of life fall into this kind of depression?"</p><p>"Other people understand intuitively that even if in old age, with their weakening hand, they begin to create a dimension of Love on Earth, the Creator will extend their life. The old people will straighten up, a smile will light up their face, and they will go to the assistance of the young."</p><p>"Still, Anastasia, It's not very nice that tourists who came to Russia from far away could not at least roam the streets of the new Russians' settlements and breathe the clean air."</p><p>"Tourists living in the cities could also feel the earth's fresh breath and drink life-giving water. A light breeze wafted over the cities bringing purity, ethers, and pollen from the homesteads drowning in greenery. The tourists observed these heavenly oases at a respectful distance when they went on excursions and tried not to disturb the families living there. Here, take a look at how it all happened."</p><p>Once again, a new picture of the future rose. I saw a highway linking the town of Vladimir and Suzdal, thirty kilometers away. I had had occasion to travel along this road before. Only rarely did I come across tour buses on it with people wishing to look at the ancient churches and monasteries of Suzdal. The highway was filled primarily with vehicles with local license plates. Now, however, this road was completely different. Handsome buses moved down the highway, which had doubled in width. They must have had electric motors because there were no exhaust fumes to be seen and no engine noise to hear, just the swishing of tires. Tourists of different nationalities were sitting in electric cars. Many observed their surroundings through binoculars.</p><p>About a kilometer from the road, over the tops of the different trees, you could see the roofs of people's houses. There, behind an even, living fence were the Russians' homesteads. On either side of the road, every two kilometers or so, handsome two-story buildings with stores and restaurants rose up. In front of each was a small paved lot where an electric zip car was parked if it was free. Another group of tourists came out of the electric car and each tried to acquire for future use what was being sold or to try it on the spot.</p><p>All the stores and cafés were supplied with food grown on the homesteads. Embroidered shirts and towels, wood crafts, and much else produced by clever hands were for sale in the stores. Anastasia explained that people eagerly bought these wares because they knew that the shirt embroidered by the good hands of a happy woman was incomparably more valuable than one manufactured on a mechanical production line.</p><p>If you looked down from above, beyond the strip of forest visible from the road, you would see shady lanes and homesteads outlined by green fences. The forest belt surrounded the settlement, which had about ninety estates. Then a field, and a kilometer after that, another settlement surrounded by a forest belt, and so on for thirty kilometers. Although the parcels were identical in size, they did not resemble one another. In some, orchard plantings predominated; in others, native trees: slender pines, spreading cedars, oaks, and birches.</p><p>Each homestead was sure to have a pond or pool. The houses, which were surrounded by flower beds, were also different: large two-story and small one-story homes. They were built in different styles: some with flat roofs, others with pointed. And a few of the little houses were white, like the dwellings in a Ukrainian village. I did not see any cars on the lanes separating the parcels. Even on the plots themselves, no special animation or work was observed. One got the impression that all this unusual beauty was being created by someone higher up, and that people were merely delighting in what had been created. At the center of each settlement were large, handsome, two-story structures, next to which children moved to and fro animatedly. That meant schools or clubs had been built at the center of the settlements.</p><p>I said to Anastasia, "There, in the center of the village, where the school and club are, you can also see such life, but on the homesteads themselves it must be utterly boring. If their owners were able to plant in such a way that the earth does not need fertilizing and pests and weeds don't need fighting off, what's left for them to do? I think a person finds more joy in intensive labor, creation, and invention, and there's nothing of that here."</p><p>"Vladimir, here, on these beautiful homesteads, people are in fact doing everything you listed, and their deeds are meaningful. This requires significantly more intellect, comprehension, and inspiration than the artists and inventors of the world you're used to."</p><p>"But if they are all artists and inventors, where are the fruits of their labor?"</p><p>"Vladimir, do you consider someone who picks up a brush and draws a beautiful landscape on canvas an artist?"</p><p>"Of course I do. People will look at his painting, and if they like it, they'll buy it or exhibit it in a picture gallery."</p><p>"Then why don't you consider as an artist
 someone who takes a hectare of land instead of a canvas and creates on it the same or even more beautiful landscape? After all, in order to create something beautiful out of living material, the creator must have not only an artistic imagination and taste, but also know the properties of many living materials. In both cases, what is created is supposed to evoke positive emotions among viewers, to please the eyes. Unlike a picture drawn on canvas, however, a living picture is also multifunctional. It cleans the air, produces beneficial ethers for man, and nourishes his flesh. A living picture changes the hues of its flowers, and it can be improved endlessly. It is connected by invisible threads to the Universe. It is incomparably more important than a picture drawn on canvas, consequently the artist who created it will be even greater."</p><p>"Yes, of course. It's hard not to agree here. But why do you also consider the owners of these homesteads inventors and scientists? Do they really have any connection to science?"</p><p>"They also have a connection to science."</p><p>"What kind?"</p><p>"For example, do you consider someone who works with plant selection, genetic engineering, to be a scientist?"</p><p>"Naturally. Everyone considers those people scientists. They work in scientific research institutes. They breed new types of vegetables and fruits and other plants, too."</p><p>"Yes, of course, they do, but it is the result, the significance of their activities that is important."</p><p>"And the result is that they have bred types of freeze-resistant and long-storage vegetables and potatoes that the Colorado beetle won't eat. In highly developed countries they have produced living beings from a cell, and now they are planning to create various organs for transplant to an ill patient — kidneys, for example."</p><p>"Yes, that's right. But have you given any thought, Vladimir, to why more and more new types of diseases are showing up in these highly developed countries? Why are they in first place for cancers? Why do they require more and more medicines? Why are more and more people suffering from infertility?"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because the many people you call scientists are not sensible creatures at all. Their human essence has been paralyzed, and the forces of destruction are functioning through their purely outwardly human image. Think for yourself, Vladimir. These supposed scientists have begun to modify the plants that exist in nature and, consequently, the fruits they bear. They've begun to change them without determining the fruits' purpose. But after all, everything in nature and the Universe interacts closely. If, for example, the mechanic removes or changes some detail in your automobile, say, the filter, the car might move for a while longer, but what would soon happen?"</p><p>"The entire fuel delivery system would break down and the engine would fail."</p><p>"That means each detail of the automobile fills its own function, and before touching it you have to determine its purpose."</p><p>"Naturally! You don't have to be a mechanic for that."</p><p>"But nature, after all, is also a perfected mechanism and as yet not completely understood by anyone. Each detail of this magnificent, living mechanism has its own purpose, a close interconnection with the entire universe, and changing the properties or removing a single detail will inevitably affect the functioning of the entire natural mechanism. Nature has many defensive functions. At first, it will signal impermissible actions. If this doesn't help, nature will be forced to destroy the poor mechanic. Man uses fruits for food, and if he starts nourishing himself with mutant fruits, he himself gradually transforms into a mutant. This kind of alteration is inevitable, given the use of altered fruits. This is already happening. Man's immune system is weakening, his mind and feelings. Man is beginning to lose abilities belonging to him alone and turning into an easily controlled biorobot, losing his independence. The appearance of new diseases confirms this. It signals the impermissibility of man's actions."</p><p>"Let's say you're right. I myself don't like these plant hybrids. At first, they were publicized. But now the governments of many countries have started issuing laws saying special labels had to be put in stores on foods created through genetic engineering. Even Russia issued such a decree. Many people are trying not to buy mutant foods, but they claim they still can't get rid of them altogether, because too many of them have been grown. There are too few real foods, and they cost more."</p><p>"There, you see? The forces of destruction are succeeding in making the human community economically dependent. They succeeded at suggesting, 'If you don't eat our foods, you'll starve to death.' But that's not true, Vladimir. Man will perish if he does eat them."</p><p>"Possibly, Anastasia, but not everyone will. Many already know about this and don't eat mutants."</p><p>"How would you, for example, recognize them, Vladimir?"</p><p>"I don't buy imported vegetables. . . . What local residents sell at the markets from their own gardens tastes much better."</p><p>"And where do they get their seeds?"</p><p>"What do you mean where? They buy them. Lots of firms are selling seeds now. They're sold in pretty, colorful packets."</p><p>"Does that mean people buy seeds guided by the information on the packet, without absolute certainty as to how well the packet's contents correspond to that information?"</p><p>"Do you mean to say that the seeds, too, might be mutants?"</p><p>"Yes. Today, for example, there are just nine apple trees left on Earth that bear primordial fruits. The apple is one of the most beneficial and delicious Divine creations for man. But it was one of the first to undergo mutation. Back in the Old Testament we encounter a warning: 'Do not make grafts . . .' But growers did so persistently, and as a result, there were no more apples. What you can see now in orchards and stores does not correspond to the Divine fruit. Those who break and destroy the primordiality of Divine creations you call scientists. But what would you call those who restore the functions of every detail of nature's mechanism?"</p><p>"Scientists, too, but probably more literate and knowledgeable ones."</p><p>"The Russian families living on homesteads you see now are restoring what was spoiled."</p><p>"But where did they get greater knowledge than the breeder-scientists, the geneticists?"</p><p>"This knowledge has existed in each person from the very beginning. The goal, intentions, and intelligence of his destiny allow them to be revealed."</p><p>"So the people living on the homesteads are both artists and scientists. But who then are we, the people living on the planet today?"</p><p>"Each can define himself if he can just free his thoughts for nine days."</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0512>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>12. Is Our Thought Free?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>"What does that mean, 'free'? All people's thoughts are free as is."</p><p>"Under the conditions of daily life in a technocratic society, Vladimir, human thought is enslaved by the framework and conventions of this world. The technocratic world can exist only on the condition that the freedom of human thought is eliminated and enslaved and the energy of human thought is absorbed.</p><p>"I don't get it. Each person can rethink all kinds of things in his lifetime. You can't say what you please, for example. There are countries with more freedom of speech and others with less, but each person is free to think whatever he likes."</p><p>"That is an illusion, Vladimir. The majority of people are forced to think about one and the same thing all their life. This is easy to see if you separate out the various thoughts of one typical person living in your era, into separate time intervals, and then combine the identical thoughts. Thus, by a completely uncomplicated action, you will determine the main thought of the human community of your era."</p><p>"Interesting. Let's try to determine this thought together."</p><p>"Fine. Tell me, what would you say is the average human life span?"</p><p>"Is this important?"</p><p>"Not very, if thinking is identical, but the number is needed for further calculations."</p><p>"Fine, the typical life span is eighty years."</p><p>"So, a man is born. Or rather, he acquires the material plane of his being. . . ."</p><p>"Let's just say he was born, that's more understandable."</p><p>"Fine. The small child looks on the world he is going to have to understand. His parents provide him with clothing, housing, and food. But through their behavior and attitude, whether they mean to or not, his parents also strive to transmit to him their thoughts and attitudes toward the world. The visible learning process lasts about eighteen years, and all those years the technocratic world tries to impress the young with its significance. Further, during the remaining sixty-two years, we can assume that the person himself can determine the direction in which his thinking works."</p><p>"Yes, we can, but you said that someone hampers that."</p><p>"I did. Why don't we calculate how much time he is free to think freely."</p><p>"Let's."</p><p>"Every day man sleeps and relaxes for a certain period. How many hours a day does a person spend on sleep?"</p><p>"Eight, as a rule."</p><p>"We have taken for our basis sixty-two years of a person's life, multiplied by eight hours a day, accounting for leap years, we get man sleeping 181,160 hours of his life. His daily eight-hour sleep comes out to twenty-one years of unbroken sleep. Let's take twenty-one years out of the sixty-two years of life and we get forty-one years of wakefulness. During wakefulness, most people engage in food preparation. How much time do you think a person spends on preparing and ingesting food?"</p><p>"The women do most of the cooking, although men have to spend more time earning money for food."</p><p>"And how much time do you think is spent on preparing and ingesting food daily, Vladimir?"</p><p>"Well,
 if you include buying the food and preparing breakfast, lunch, and dinner, then three hours on a weekday, probably. Except not everyone in the family cooks, the rest eat, well, maybe they help buy the food and wash the dishes, so it comes to two and a half hours a day per person."</p><p>"In fact, it's more, but let's take your number, just two and a half hours a day, multiply that by the number of days lived, and we get 56,612.5 hours, or 2359 days, or 6 years. Let's subtract that from 41 years, and we're left with 35 years. In order to acquire food, clothing, and housing, the person living in the technocratic world has to fulfill one of the functions essential to this world: he has to work. I want to draw your attention, Vladimir, to the fact that man has to work, to engage in some kind of occupation, not because he likes it so much but for the benefit of the technocratic world, otherwise man is deprived of what is vitally important for him.</p><p>"How much time are most people forced to spend on work daily?"</p><p>"In our country, eight, and on the commute back and forth he spends another hour or two, but he has two days off per week."</p><p>"Why don't you try to calculate for yourself how many years of his life man spends on work that he does not always care for."</p><p>"It would take a long time without a calculator. You tell me."</p><p>"Altogether, in thirty years of so-called labor activity, he works for ten years for someone else, or rather, for the technocratic world. So now we have to delete these ten years from his thirty-five years of life, which leaves twenty-five."</p><p>"What else does man do every day throughout his life?"</p><p>"He watches television."</p><p>"How much time daily?"</p><p>"At least three hours."</p><p>"These three hours come out to eight years of continuous sitting in front of a television screen. Let's subtract them from the remaining twenty-five and we get seventeen. But even this time is still not free for activities inherent to man alone. Human thought is inert. It cannot switch abruptly from one thing to another. Thought analyzes information taken in for a while. In total, the average statistical person spends just 15-20 minutes in his entire life thinking about the universe. Some don't think about it even once; some think about it for several years. Each can determine that for himself by analyzing the years he has lived. Each person is individual; he is more important than all the galaxies put together because he is capable of creating them. But each person is a small part of the human community, which on the whole can be viewed as a single organism, a unified essence. Once it falls into the trap of technocratic dependence, the great essence of the Universe closes in on itself, loses true freedom, becomes dependent, activates the mechanism of self-destruction.</p><p>The people in the settlements of the future live a different way, distinct from the usual. Their thinking is free and humane. It merges into a single aspiration, and it leads the human community out of its impasse. The galaxies are trembling in joyous presentiment before the unified human dream. The universe will soon see new birth and joint creation. Human thought is materializing the wonderful new planet."</p><p>"That's great, the way you talk so loftily about the settlements. But outwardly they're just people."</p><p>"Even their outward appearance has a difference. They glow with great energy. Look more closely at that grandmother and grandson riding."</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0513>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>13. Horsewoman from the Future</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>I saw a wagon from a settlement, or rather, a carriage with its top down harnessed to a chestnut horse. An elderly woman sat on the carriage's soft seat, a basket of apples and vegetables in front of her. Up front, a shirtless boy of about seven held the reins, but he wasn't guiding the horse. This was probably not the first time they had made their trip, and the horse was trotting down a familiar route.</p><p>The boy turned to the elderly woman and said something to her. The grandmother smiled and began to sing. The child joined in, picking up the refrain. Tourists passing in electric buses could scarcely have heard their song. The horse was running down the road about a kilometer from the highway.</p><p>Nearly all the tourists looked at the people in the carriage through binoculars, holding their breath, as if it were a miracle or extraterrestrials, and once again I thought that this wasn't working out quite right. People were coming from distant countries but could not interact normally with those whom they had come to see, they could only observe from afar. And the two in the carriage weren't even looking in their direction. One of the buses slowed down and proceeded in parallel with the speed of the trotting horse. Sitting in this bus was a group of foreign children. They waved at the grandmother and grandson riding in the distance in their handsome carriage, or rather to the boy, but he did not even glance in their direction once. Suddenly a young horsewoman appeared from the handsome, plant-filled living gates of the settlement. Her fast bay began catching up to the carriage at a swift gallop. Pulling even, the heated horse began prancing alongside. The elderly woman smiled and listened to what the young horsewoman was telling her.</p><p>The boy, dissatisfied, probably, with the interruption in the singing but still with hidden joy said didactically, "What a fidget you are, Mama, you can't stay alone for a minute." The young woman laughed, took a turnover out of the canvas sack tied to her saddle, and held it out to the boy. He took it, bit into it, and then, with the words, "Try it, grandma, it's still nice and warm," held the turnover out to the elderly woman and pulling on the rains, stopped the carriage. The boy leaned over, picked the basket filled with handsome apples up with two hands, held it out to the rider, and said, "Please, Mama, take this to them," and his eyes pointed toward the halted bus of foreign children.</p><p>Lightly grabbing the heavy basket of apples with one hand and giving her prancing steed a light slap on the neck, the young horsewoman dashed toward the bus of children. By that time, several more buses had stopped next to the children's, and their passengers were ecstatically watching the rider race across the meadow holding a basket of apples. She flew up to the children, who had spilled out of the bus, reined in her horse, deftly bent down and without getting out of the saddle placed the basket of apples before the ecstatic children.</p><p>She also managed to pat a swarthy little boy on the head, wave in greeting to all, and head her steed right down the middle of the highway. The bus driver announced over his portable radio, "She's racing right down the median strip. She's beautiful!"</p><p>Many tourist buses pulled off onto the highway's shoulder and stopped. The people quickly got out of the buses and lined up along the road. Holding their breath, they watched the young beauty riding at a swift gallop. Not an exclamation but a whisper of admiration tore from many lips. And there was something to admire. Her hot steed, racing in a swift gallop, threw up sparks from its hooves. No one was chasing it, the woman riding it did not have a whip or even a twig, but the steed kept picking up its swift pace, its hooves barely touched the road, and its mane fanned out in the oncoming wind. It must have wanted to be worthy of the beauty riding it.</p><p>Her outward beauty was unusual. Of course, one could admire both her regular facial features, and her dark blond braid, and her thick eyelashes. Of course, under her embroidered white blouse and skirt in white daisies one could clearly imagine the taut, chiseled torso of her magnificent figure. The flowing, feminine lines of her entire figure seemed to frame an indefatigable energy. The flush playing on her cheeks radiated the grandeur and indomitable possibilities of this mysterious energy. The young-looking rider stood out from the people standing at the side of the road with her unusual healthy look. She sat on her hot steed without the slightest tension. She was not even holding onto the pommel or reins, and she had not put her feet, which were thrown to one side of the horse's rump, into the stirrups. Lowering her eyelashes, she rebraided her hair, which had come slightly undone, into a tight braid with smooth movements of her hands. Sometimes the beauty raised her eyelashes. And when her gaze seemed to singe with an invisible, pleasant fire, one of the people in the crowd; the person who met that gaze, seemed to straighten up visibly, became taller.</p><p>People seemed to catch with their feelings the light and energy emanating from the rider and attempted to fill up with it, at least partially. She understood their desire and graciously shared, and she raced forward, and she was beautiful. Suddenly, a temperamental Italian ran out on the road to intercept the speeding horse, spread his arms out, and exclaimed ecstatically, "Rossia! Ai luf yu, Rossia!" The rider neither shuddered nor took fright when her horse reared and pranced in place. She just grabbed the pummel of her saddle with one hand, with the other tore a flower from the wreath adorning her head, and threw it to the Italian. He caught the gift, pressed it carefully to his chest, as if it were the greatest treasure, constantly repeating, "Mama mia, mama mia."</p><p>But the beauty wasn't looking at the ardent Italian. She touched the reins of her steed, and the horse moved, dancing lightly, toward the people standing on the shoulder. The crowd parted, and the young rider lightly jumped from her horse and stood opposite a woman who looked like European and was carrying a little girl. The little girl was asleep.</p><p>The slightly round-shouldered mother, with a pale face and tired
 eyes, was having a hard time holding her, trying not to disturb the child's sleep. The rider stopped opposite the woman and smiled at her. The two women's, the two mothers' eyes met. You could tell how different the two women's inner states were. The despondency of the mother holding her child made her resemble a fading flower next to the young woman who had approached her and whose appearance was associated with the indefatigable exuberance of the flowering of thousands of gardens.</p><p>The two woman looked into each other's eyes silently. And suddenly, as if roused by some new awareness, the mother holding the sleeping girl stood up straight and a smile appeared on her face. With smooth, unusually graceful, feminine movements of her hands, the Russian removed the pretty wreath from her head and put it on the mother's head. They did not say a single word to each other. Lightly jumping into the saddle of the horse standing calmly nearby, the beautiful rider once again rushed forward. For some reason the people applauded her, and the now smiling, slender woman holding her now awakened smiling little daughter watched her go, and the ardent Italian, tearing off an expensive wristwatch, ran after her and shouted, "A souvenir, mama mia." But the beauty was already far away.</p><p>Her dashing horse turned off the road onto a platform where tourists were sitting at long tables, drinking kvass and fruit drink, and trying some other dishes as well, which waiters served to them from a handsome carved wooden house. Yet another building was being completed nearby. Two men were laying a handsome carved frame around the window of the new building, which was probably a store or restaurant. Hearing the clicking of hooves, one of the men turned toward the approaching rider, said something to his comrade, and leaped from the scaffolding. The ardent beauty reined in her horse, jumped to the ground, quickly untied the canvas bag from her saddle, ran toward the man, and shyly held out the bag to him.</p><p>"Turnovers. . . . Apple turnovers, like you like, still warm."</p><p>"You are such a fidgeter, Ekaterinka," the man said gently, eating a turnover out of the bag and screwing his face up from pleasure.</p><p>The tourists sitting at the table stopped eating and drinking to admire the lovers. That is how this man and this young beauty who had just jumped from her hot steed stood in front of each other, as if they weren't man and wife at all, as if they did not have children, but were ardent lovers. The beauty who had just galloped fifteen kilometers under the admiring gazes of the tourists and who had seemed omnipotent and as free as the wind, stood shyly in front of her beloved, looked up at him, and then lowered her lashes shyly. The man suddenly stopped eating and said,</p><p>"Ekaterinka, look, there's a wet spot on your blouse. That means it's time to feed Vanechka."</p><p>She covered the small wet spot on her milk-filled breast with her hand and replied shyly, "I'll be there in time. He is still asleep. I'll do everything in time."</p><p>"Then hurry. I'll be home soon, too. We're already finishing our work. Look, do you like it?"</p><p>She glanced at the windows decorated with carved frames.</p><p>"Yes. I like it very much. I also wanted to tell you something."</p><p>"Speak."</p><p>She came right up to her husband and stood on tiptoe, stretching up to his ear. He leaned over, listening closely, and she quickly kissed his cheek and without turning around hopped in the saddle of her horse standing next to her. The beauty's happy, cascading laughter merged with the clicking of hooves. She sped home not down the asphalt road but across the meadow grass. All the tourists were still watching her go. And what was so special about this young woman galloping across the meadow on her dashing steed, this mother of two children? Yes, she was beautiful. Yes, she brimmed over with energy. Yes, she was good. But why did all the people watch her go so unwaveringly? Might this not be simply a woman speeding across a meadow on a horse? Might this be materialized happiness rushing home to feed her infant and greet her beloved husband? The people are admiring happiness racing home.</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0514>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>14. City on the Neva</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>"Did the same kinds of changes take place in Petersburg as in Moscow?" I asked Anastasia.</p><p>"Events came about slightly differently in the city erected on the Neva. There the children felt the need to build a future for themselves in a different way before the adults did. It was the children who began to change the city, without waiting for an official decree."</p><p>"That's great. The children again. How did it all begin?"</p><p>"At the corner of the Fontanka River's embankment and Nevsky Prospect, builders were digging a trench, and an eleven-year-old boy accidently fell into it and hurt his leg. For a long time, while he was unable to walk, he sat by the window in his apartment at no. 25, which is on the Fontanka River embankment. The apartment's windows looked out on the courtyard, not the river. Opposite the window was a shabby brick wall, and built onto it was a building with rust spots on the roof.</p><p>"One day the boy asked his father,</p><p>"'Papa, is our city considered the best in the country?'</p><p>"'Of course,' the father answered his son, 'and one of the best in the world, too.'</p><p>"'But why is it the best?'</p><p>"'What do you mean why? It has all kinds of monuments and museums, and the architecture in the city's center delights everyone.'</p><p>"'But we live in the center, too, and all we see out the window is a shabby wall and a rusty roof.'</p><p>"'The wall. . . . Well yes, we're a little out of luck with the view from our window.'</p><p>"'Are we the only ones?'</p><p>"'There may be someone else, but for the most part. . . .'</p><p>"The boy photographed the view from the window of his apartment, and when he was able to go back to school, he showed the photograph to his friends.</p><p>"All the children in his class took pictures of the view from the windows of their apartments and compared photographs. The overall picture did not delight the eye. The boy and his friends went to the newspaper's editor and asked him the question he had first asked his father,</p><p>"'Why is our city considered more beautiful than others?'</p><p>"They tried to explain to him about the Alexander Column and the Hermitage. They talked about Kazan Cathedral and the legendary Nevsky Prospect.</p><p>"'What makes Nevsky beautiful?' the boy persisted with his questions. 'I think it looks like a stone trench with flaking edges.'</p><p>"They tried to explain to him the merits of the architecture and spoke about the sculpting on the facades. They told him that the city did not have enough money yet to restore all the buildings at once, but soon it would and then everyone would see how beautiful Nevsky was.</p><p>"'But can a stone trench really be beautiful, even if it has renovated sculpting? Not only that, it's soon going to start peeling, and someone again will fill in the holes and shore up what's falling down.'</p><p>"The boy and his friends went from editorial office to editorial office, showed their now huge collection of photographs with different views, and asked the same question. His persistence irritated the journalists at first.</p><p>"One day, a reporter for a youth newspaper told him in the hallway, 'You've come to see us again? And you drag your fellow champions along with you, and you have more and more of them. You don't like the city or the views from your windows, but can you do anything at all? We don't need you to criticize. March back to your homes, don't get in our way!'</p><p>"An old journalist heard the stern conversation with the children, too. Watching the group of children proceeding to the exit, he told the young reporter thoughtfully, 'You know, for some reason their persistence reminds me of a fairytale.'</p><p>"'A fairytale? Which one?' the reporter asked.</p><p>"'The Emperor's New Clothes. In it, a boy says, "The emperor has no clothes!"'</p><p>"The boy did not bother the newspapers with his questions anymore and no longer took his many photographs out of his schoolbag to show them. One school year ended and another began. The news spread to all the newspapers that the boy had shown up once again, accompanied by his friends.</p><p>"Admiringly, the old editor told his colleagues in the House of Journalists the story for the umpteenth time: 'He showed up. . . . Yes. Imagine, he got into the waiting room. And not alone. A few of them sat quietly for a few hours in the waiting room. And I saw them. I warned them to talk fast, and they fit it into two minutes. They went in and unfolded a sheet of Whatman on my desk. I looked at their masterpiece and was speechless. I couldn't tear my eyes away.</p><p>"'Two minutes must have passed in this way because the boy told everyone, "Time for us to go. Our time here's run out."'</p><p>"'"What's this?" I exclaimed as they walked out the door. He turned around, and I felt the gaze of another era on me. "Yes . . . we still have a lot to make sense of. . . . Yes. . . ."'</p><p>"'"Well, did he say anything at all?"</p><p>"'"Yes, don't keep us waiting. Is he planning to come again?" those gathered asked, and the old editor replied, "He turned around and said, 'Our Nevsky is before you. Right now it's just a drawing. Later the whole city will be like that'—and the door shut."'</p><p>"For the umpteenth time the journalists leaned over the plan and admired its marvelous beauty.</p><p>"The buildings on Nevsky Prospect no longer abutted one another, forming a solid stone wall. Some of the old buildings remained, and every other building was removed. In the spaces formed between the buildings were magnificent green oases. Birds nested in the birches, pines, and cedars, and it seemed to those looking at the picture that they could hear the singing. People sat on benches under the treetops, and they were
 surrounded by beautiful flowering shrubs and bushes of raspberries and currants. The green oases edged out onto the avenue, and Nevsky now looked like a marvelous living green lane, rather than a stone trench.</p><p>"Many mirrors were installed in the building facades. They reflected thousands of sunbeams, playing with the passersby, caressing the flowers' petals, sparkling in the streams of the small fountains built in each green oasis. People drank water with sunbeams and smiled."</p><p>"Anastasia, did the boy ever appear again?"</p><p>"What boy?"</p><p>"The one who kept going from editorial office to editorial office with his question."</p><p>"The boy left for good. He became a great architect. He and his fellow champions created the beautiful cities and settlements of the future where happy people came to live. But his first beautiful creation on Earth was the city he created on the Neva."</p><p>* * *</p><p>"Anastasia, tell me, when will Russia's beautiful future come?"</p><p>"You can determine the year yourself, Vladimir."</p><p>"How can I do that? Is time really in man's control?"</p><p>"Each man can control his actions in time. Everything created by a dream already exists in space. The dreams of many human souls—your readers—embody the Divine dream in the material. What you have seen will be embodied in three hundred years, but maybe even now, at this instant."</p><p>"This instant? You can't build a building in an instant, and an orchard won't even grow in a year."</p><p>"But if you, where you're living now, in your little apartment, plant a seed in a small pot of earth and from it sprouts a shoot of a native tree that will rise up at your future homestead."</p><p>"You yourself say it will be, not that it is. That means a dream cannot materialize in an instant."</p><p>"Why can't it? After all, materially, the seed you plant is the beginning of its embodiment. The shoot interacts with all of space, it materializes your dream, beautiful and bright energies wrap around you, and you yourself stand before the Father as the embodiment of His dream."</p><p>"Yes, that's interesting. You mean we must act immediately?"</p><p>"Naturally."</p><p>"Only where am I to find the words to clarify it all to people?"</p><p>"You will find the words if you can be sincere and righteous before people."</p><p>"I don't know how it will work out, but I am going to act. Your dream has taken root in my soul, Anastasia. And I very much want to turn the future I've seen into a reality as quickly as possible."</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0515>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>15. Make it a Reality</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>First and foremost, it was essential to determine whether people were interested in building eco-settlements and then living and working in them. I asked the Anastasia Foundation for Culture and Creative Support in the City of Vladimir to disseminate information on the construction of an eco-settlement based on Anastasia's plan. Two months later, 139 people, including Russians who had emigrated abroad, had responded and expressed their desire to be involved in construction in the future settlement. As the book about the future Russia and about Russians' new way of life spread, the number of people interested, from various regions, could increase by a factor of hundreds and thousands. Consequently, the organization of settlement construction should begin simultaneously in different regions. Thus, Vladimir's Foundation, which gathers and synthesizes information in terms of the present legal basis on a given issue, proposed to readers who share Anastasia's views to begin with the following.</p><p>First, Begin in your own region by organizing an initiative group with an eye to giving it legal status appropriate to current legislation.</p><p>In some regions, there may already be reading clubs or public organizations for Anastasia's readers, and they could take on the organizing duties. But if there are none of these in your area, ask Vladimir's Anastasia Foundation, which receives a lot of correspondence and will give you addresses. In general, I am putting great hope in entrepreneurs. They have more experience in organizational issues. So, even if there are public associations, still try to connect with entrepreneurs.</p><p>It is essential, at least temporarily or for a probationary term, to select your own authorized representative, a chairman, who will act as a representative in your name in governmental bodies (submit statements for land allocation, call meetings when necessary, and so on). You must assign your chairman a small salary. The role of representative can be carried out by either a physical person or a legal entity.</p><p>For example, the latter could be a well-known construction company, which would subsequently enjoy priority in obtaining contracts for the construction of both private homes and infrastructure buildings. Such a large contract would be highly advantageous for a construction company because it could also agree to take on the job of registering land allocation and working out the design and budgeting documentation.</p><p>Second. Go to your local administrative bodies and directly to the administrative head of your region with an official statement on the allocation of a land parcel as a single allotment with an area of at least 150 hectares. The size of the land parcel depends on how many people are planning to obtain land and on the supply in your region.</p><p>It is essential to bear in mind that in the future many families will live in the future settlement permanently and, consequently, it must have an elementary school, a first aid station, and a club, the construction of which is more easily managed by a larger number of people. Small settlements will not be able to create the necessary infrastructure.</p><p>Third. Upon receipt of the land, you must turn to land management specialists, architects, and builders for putting together a plan for the settlement. This is also important, since it is essential to have information on how deep the water is on the allocated parcel, in order to determine the possibility of drilling a well for water in each building, how deep to lay the foundation of a building, and whether a small pond can be made on each parcel. Overall planning is also important to determine the location for the future school, common recreational areas, and entrance routes.</p><p>Vladimir's Foundation has already hired competent specialists who are working on a model plan, and if it is ready by the time you start organizing your initiative group, you can request it from the Foundation. This would be cheaper. Then you need to adapt the model plan to suit your location and share it with other initiative groups. Successful suggestions that others like will be approved, and ultimately we will create a common plan.</p><p>Fourth. After work on the settlement plan, in which not only specialists but future residents can take part, is complete, you will receive a detailed blueprint, an overall drawing, where individual parcels of at least one hectare will be marked. Each person must be officially allocated a parcel of land, possibly by drawing lots. Use of the parcel has to be made legal by the appropriate legal document and must be registered in the name of its owner, not the organization, as was done in India's Auroville.</p><p>And so, you are standing on your own parcel of land, on your own hectare. This is your homestead, the place where your descendants will be born and live, have a kind word to say about their founder, their forefather, and perhaps even take him to task for a few mistakes in setting up the place. The plan for everything that will be located on this parcel now depends on you alone. Where you will plant your family tree, for example, an oak or cedar, which will grow for up to 550 years and may behold as many as nine generations of your descendants to remember you?</p><p>Where will you decide to dig a pond, plant an orchard, a small grove of forest trees, build your house and lay out flowerbeds? What kind of living fence will you create around your homestead? Perhaps the kind Anastasia described, perhaps even more magical and functionally useful than the one I described in my previous book. You can build it right away. Even before you receive the documents for the land, before you organize an initiative group made up of like-minded people. You can begin construction in your mind and think through each and every corner of your future homestead.</p><p>It is essential to remember that the home you build, even a fairly sturdy one, will stand for a hundred years and start to deteriorate. The living structure you lay out will improve, strengthen, and grow thick through the centuries, and even the millennia, transmitting your vital thought to your descendants.</p><p>You can build right away, and not only in your mind. Right away you can sow the seeds of your homestead's future magnificent family trees in a pot on your windowsill. Of course, you can purchase saplings for planting in a special nursery or dig up a young shoot in the forest where overgrown vegetation needs thinning, without damage to the forest. You may, of course, but I think Anastasia is right: it is better to grow your own sapling, especially if this is the sapling of your future family tree. A sapling from a nursery is like a child from an orphanage, and you must raise several different saplings, not just one. Before planting a seed in a pot of earth, saturate the little seed with information about yourself.</p><p>I realize that to overcome such official obstacles as might arise in some regions, support is needed at the state level—or if not support, then at least no resistance. Appropriate policy is needed from legislative bodies. So as not to sit with your hands folded waiting for this to happen of its own accord, for at least one of the existing political structures to mature enough to render support to this project, at my request, Vladimir's
 Anastasia Foundation has worked out a draft charter for a new party, a party of land users. This budding new public formation was called Co-Creation. Its charter, still subject to discussion and further work, has, in my view, one main point: "The state should allocate one hectare of land for lifetime use to each family wishing to set up its own homestead."</p><p>This movement is still young, and no one directs it. Yet I think, in time, knowledgeable politicians will appear in it capable of shaping the appropriate attitude toward the new movement at the level of state policy. For now, Co-Creation's job consists of organizing an information center. As finances permit, the legal department will begin to function. Presently, the work on Co-Creation is performed by the secretariat of the city of Vladimir's Anastasia Foundation for Culture and Creative Support.</p><p>Regional initiative groups for organizing new settlements can achieve great success once they have obtained the local administration's support. This is possible if the administration sees significant pluses for the region and must be shown these right away. They exist and they are significant. Try to organize a discussion of the project in the local press, and let specialists—ecologists, economists, sociologists—give their opinions on the project's impact on your region specifically.</p><p>In order to help at least a little in land allocation for homesteads, I decided to write and publish in this book an open letter to the President of Russia.</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0516>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>16. Open Appeal</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>To Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,</p><p>President of the Russian Federation</p><p>From Vladimir Nikolaevich Megre,</p><p>citizen of the Russian Federation</p><p>Esteemed Vladimir Vladimirovich!</p><p>Our generation has probably been very lucky. We have been presented with the real opportunity to begin the construction of a happy, flourishing state, strongly protected from any outside aggressor, internal conflicts, and crime—a state where happy families will live in prosperity. Not only can our generation begin to build a beautiful country, but it itself will be able to live in it, given the good will of those legislators able to allocate to each family that wishes it one hectare of land for setting up its own homestead. This fairly simple action will call forth a creative surge among the majority of people from various strata of society.</p><p>The land must be allocated gratuitously, for lifetime use, with the right to inherit. The food produced on a homestead must be tax-exempt .</p><p>You will agree, Vladimir Vladimirovich, that we now have an abnormal, illogical situation. Each Russian seems to have a homeland, but no one can say where his personal piece of homeland is. If each family receives it and transforms it into a flourishing, heavenly corner, then our greater Homeland will become beautiful.</p><p>Today's plans for the country's development do not inspire the people to create, for they do not understand where, to what future, those plans are leading. The majority of the population may, even intuitively, be repelled by the construction of a democratic, economically developed state on the Western model, and for good reason, I think. After all, why should we, individually and altogether, spend our efforts building a state where ultimately drug addiction, prostitution, and crime flourish? All that does exist in the West, after all.</p><p>Previously we believed that the so-called highly developed countries had an abundance of food, but it has become clear that this abundance was achieved at the expense of using all kinds of toxic chemical soil additives, as well as genetic engineering. We have seen that imported foods are inferior in taste to ours. For example, the Germans are glad to buy potatoes imported from Russia.</p><p>In many countries, governments concerned by this food problem have already issued decrees on their special packaging. The use of foods obtained as a result of genetic engineering are arousing increasing caution among scientists as well. America and Germany have some of the highest cancer rates per capita. Should we be following their path? A path like that inspires hardly anyone. But we have reconciled ourselves to the propaganda for imported goods and the Western way of life. We have reconciled ourselves to the fact that more and more new diseases are appearing, that water can be drunk only from bottles bought in a store, that Russia's population decreases by 750,000 people annually. Everything is just like it is for them. After all, the birth rate has dropped in highly developed countries, too. We are striving in many ways to resemble them. But never once have I had occasion to hear from the people living in those countries about their hope— the hope that Russia is in search of and must certainly find its own path of development and show the whole world a happier way of life.</p><p>Mr. President, undoubtedly, various programs for the country's development have been proposed for your consideration. If among the others, this proposal seems dubious to you, I ask you to approve it as an experiment in the regions whose governors can see a rational kernel in it.</p><p>The books I wrote as the "Ringing Cedars of Russia" series speak in more detail about this proposal. It is hard for me to imagine that, while you are in the flurry of matters of state you personally might have read them. However, the appropriate administrative bodies are familiar with them and have already issued their verdict. They have determined that these books have given birth in Russia to a new religion that should spread like wildfire. This opinion has been expressed in several publications in the press—to me, a total surprise. In my books, I had expressed my attitude toward God but had not thought about the creation of any religion. I was simply writing books about an unusual and beautiful hermit in the Siberian taiga and her fervent dream of the beautiful. The stormy reaction from people of various social status and the popularity of the books in Russia and abroad may even resemble religiosity. But I think the crux of the matter lies elsewhere. The ideas, philosophy, and knowledge of the Siberian hermit and the idiom she communicates in are stirring people's souls.</p><p>Analysts probably will not come to a unified opinion for a long time about who Anastasia is, what the books with her statements mean, and how to define the reaction to them, which is fine, as long as the concrete proposals Anastasia makes do not drown in these investigations.</p><p>Vladimir Vladimirovich, in order to be convinced of the effectiveness of what Anastasia is proposing regarding land, an experiment can be conducted, independent of who Anastasia and V. Megre are. Its least significant assertions can be approved.</p><p>First, I do not think it would be very hard for your government to issue a directive to the appropriate scientific research institute to conduct a simple analysis of the effectiveness of Anastasia's proposals concerning cleaning up the air in the big cities from harmful dust. The essence of this proposal is laid out in my first book.</p><p>Second, instruct them to conduct an analysis of the oil from the Siberian cedar nut as a medicinal tonic. Information from ancient sources and the modern research by scientists from Tomsk University confirm Anastasia's assertion that this natural product, if the specific technology for obtaining it is followed, is one of the most effective means in the world for treating a large spectrum of diseases. Siberia has more expansive plantations where the nut-bearing cedar grows than anywhere in the world.</p><p>The Russian budget could have tangible profits from supplying this product to the international market and its use inside the country. A state program is needed to utilize Siberia's wild harvest—a program that provides not for large mechanized production but for the development of a network of small enterprises that bring in people living in remote Siberian regions. Implementing this program does not require major capital investments. One need only a legislative decision allowing local residents to acquire long-term leases on taiga lands.</p><p>In general, Vladimir Vladimirovich, life is inexorably confirming assertions that seem most incredible at first glance. Personally, I am absolutely convinced of our country's beautiful future. The only question is whether those living today will accelerate or delay it. I sincerely wish that you, Vladimir Vladimirovich, and all of us alive today become the creators of a beautiful future!</p><p> </p><p>Respectfully yours,</p><p>Vladimir Megre</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0517>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>17. Questions and Answers</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>Anastasia's plan captivated me. I wanted to think and talk about it daily. I wanted to protect it, defend it against ridicule, and allay skeptics' doubts no matter what. I would talk about it at the readers' conferences held in Gelendzhik and at the Central House of Writers in Moscow. Most attendees—and there were a total of more than two thousand of them from different countries of the former Soviet Union and further abroad—supported this project and took an interest in it. However, I will cite here the main questions and comments of the doubters and my answers to them, based on Anastasia's assertions, my own convictions, and the information I have been able to collect.</p><p>Question: In the modern world, no state's economy can live outside the world economic system. Modern economic processes attest to the necessity of creating large industrial structures and special knowledge of the laws of the modern market and its structure and the priority directions of financial streams. One gets the sense that you have had no education
 in economics. Your proposal consists of stressing small goods production, which can take away from the main thing and shake a state's economy.</p><p>Answer: Indeed, I have not had any education in economics. However, I completely agree with you that major concerns and plants have great importance for a state's economy. I think, and you will agree, that a large plant is economically profitable for the state only when it operates and produces output that has a demand. When a large enterprise comes to a halt—and such instances are no rarity in our state or in others—it brings losses.</p><p>The state is forced to pay workers an unemployment subsidy. Hundreds of thousands of people are forced to drag out a pitiful existence, receiving this miserly subsidy. They don't know what they should do because they're used to feeding themselves solely from their job. In these instances, they could use their freed-up time for more intensive labor on their homestead.</p><p>A homestead is not only a place to live and spend time pleasantly, it can also produce income, more income than many even large enterprises. As for the state as a whole, for the most part it consists not only of large and small concerns; its main component is in fact the family cell.</p><p>A homestead for each family could be the rear guard, an insurance policy for every possible kind of economic cataclysm in the state. I do not think there is anything bad in each family being given the opportunity to provide for their own comfortable existence independently. I also think that personal freedom is impossible without economic freedom. A working family living even in a modern urban apartment cannot be free. It is dependent on the employer who sets the salary, on utilities that do or do not provide heat, water, and light, on food supplies, and on the costs for services and food. It is the slave of all this, and the children in a family like that are born with a slave mentality.</p><p>Question: Russia is an industrially developed country and mighty nuclear power. Only in this condition can it ensure the security of its citizens. If all of a country's inhabitants work only on the land, the country turns into a purely agrarian state and becomes defenseless against an aggressor.</p><p>Answer: I don't think that everyone has to agree at once to work only with their parcels. The process will be gradual, and the situation will regulate itself naturally. The state's might depends not only on it having a sufficient number of nuclear warheads but also on its overall economic status, which includes both the quantity and quality of its food. If there is not enough of the food man needs in a state, the state has to sell its natural resources and weapons, thereby strengthening its possible opponent.</p><p>The proposed project can strengthen the state's economic status and, consequently, provide an opportunity for science and industry to work more successfully and to support a more combat-ready army. In the near future, however, if there is a wide-scale introduction of this way of life, I think and am convinced that it will definitely arouse interest among many citizens of other countries, including countries that are not now friendly toward us. There, too, like many Russians, people will want to arrange their own life. The beginning of this project's implementation in different countries will also be the beginning of peaceful coexistence among nations.</p><p>Question: In the most prosperous regions of Russia this project can, of course, be implemented. But don't you think it naïve to suppose that it can be implemented in a primordially gangster republic like Chechnya?</p><p>Answer: I regard the significant reduction of social tension, especially in so-called hot spots, and the total cessation of conflicts with the help of this project not as naïve but as absolutely realistic. If we take the Northern Caucasus and its most sensitive point, Chechnya, as an example, then at present it has become clear—and the press has been talking about this—that the basis for the conflict is the struggle by a small group of individuals for possession of the republic's oil reserves, for power, and for money. This kind of situation characterizes most hot spots and conflicts of various times in general. Then why have so many people in Chechnya, especially men, been drawn into military actions in Chechnya?</p><p>There were hundreds of illegal oil refineries in Chechnya belonging to a small group of individuals. Tens of thousands of workers from among the local population worked at these enterprises. With the state's efforts to bring order to the area, these people wound up unemployed and their families, consequently, without the means to live. This category of the population took the insurgents' side, basically defending, in fact, their jobs and the well-being, albeit minimal, of their families. In addition, as we know, they did not do so for free, but received decent compensation compared with their unemployment benefit for participating in military actions. Consequently, for the majority of rank-and-file insurgents, participation in the actions of militant groups is just a job, like a policeman or Russian army officer, only better paid. Therefore, many rank-and-file insurgents consider the cessation of military actions clearly unpromising for the well-being of their families.</p><p>How can unemployment be eliminated in Chechnya if we have not been able to eliminate it completely in a single region, even one that is well off? What if the government, which has sent tremendous sums to Chechnya, starts building all kinds of enterprises there in order to provide a job for everyone who wants one? Here, yet another problem arises—the size of salaries. If it is raised especially for the Chechen population, then all Russia is going to be working for Chechnya, since in this case, the money can only be taken from taxpayers. But in this case most of the money would be diverted, since so far the problem of getting allocated funds to those in need has yet to be solved. As a result, we are going to have the same significant increase in expenses.</p><p>The Republic of Chechnya is a region favorable for agriculture. Let us imagine that that our country already has a law on land for homesteads in effect. Let us imagine that the state safeguards homesteads from any encroachments. A Chechen family gets land for its own homestead, where all the output produced is its property exclusively and which will be the property of future generations, ensuring their comfort and a life not as pariahs threatened by bombs, but in their own a beautiful corner, their little piece of homeland which they themselves have set up. I am convinced that this kind of family would not oppose the state that has provided them with this opportunity, and it would defend with more fervor the state it now opposes. It would defend that state with the same desperation as it would defend its own family nest. It would cut short any attempts by instigators to separate Chechnya from that state and any attempts at ethnic discrimination.</p><p>I am convinced that with an action of sufficient scale to organize these kinds of settlements in Chechnya, even as an experiment, this hot spot called Chechnya would turn into one of Russia's most reliable regions and become a significant spiritual center on Earth. Everything would turn around 180 degrees. When Anastasia spoke about the factors that could help eliminate crime, I too found it hard to believe what she said right away. But life later steadily confirmed the truth of what she said anyway.</p><p>As for the Republic of Chechnya, more than a thousand people came to Gelendzhik for a readers' conference from various regions of Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. What struck me most of all was the delegation from Chechnya. No one had especially invited them to the conference. The Chechens came themselves. I later spoke with some of them separately.</p><p>Right now we are talking about Chechnya, but isn't there crime in other places in our country? Of course there is, and in every possible manifestation. One of the causes of crime is unemployment, a situation that does not allow someone coming out of prison to find a place for himself in our society. Anastasia's project can solve this problem as well.</p><p>Question: If each family that wants it in Russia is given a hectare, there won't be enough land for everyone. And there definitely won't be enough for the new, rising generation.</p><p>Answer: At the present time, the more acute question is that there is no one to work the land. I have in mind not only the wastelands and inarable lands, but also the arable land. As for the rising generation, unfortunately, each year more Russians die than are born. According to data from the State Statistics Committee, Russia's population is declining annually by 750,000, so the problem right now is for there to be a new generation at all.</p><p>Originally, I held the illusion that a family or single person living, say, in an apartment in a five-story building took up less land than a family or person with a private house with a garden. That turned out not to be the case at all. Every person, no matter what floor he lives on, daily uses for nourishment everything that grows on earth. In order to get what has grown to him, it takes roads, trucks, warehouses, and stores, and they are all on land, too. Consequently, each person is served by his parcel of land every minute. Served even though man has abandoned it or doesn't think about it.</p><p>Of course, I couldn't answer the question posed right away based on specific figures, but later I found those figures and can now cite them in this book.</p><p>The Land of Russia: The total area of the Russian Federation is 1.7098 billion hectares. Only 667.7 million hectares can be put into agricultural use. As of the beginning of 1996, the total area of agricultural lands was 222 million hectares,
 or 13 percent of the country's total land resources, including pastureland of 130.2 million hectares (7.6 percent).</p><p>The total population of the Russian Federation for this year is 147 million. As the figures show, there is no problem with allocating a hectare of land to each family wanting one. In fact, the problem lies elsewhere: the population of our state is declining catastrophically. Here are the forecasts analysts have made: a general description of the Russian population between 2000 and 2045 (the forecast is based on existing trends) has the number of children under age fifteen halved and the number of elderly persons one and a half times as many. The population's reproductive potential will be nearly exhausted.</p><p>There is one other problem: the quality of our state's arable lands.</p><p>The topsoil is being destroyed over large areas. Specialists believe that these processes have already taken on a regional and interregional nature. In Russia, 117 million hectares (or 63 percent) of the agricultural lands have been subjected to erosion and erosion hazard. In the last fifty years, the speed of erosion processes has increased thirty-fold, and especially quickly since the early 1990s. According to experts at the UN's FAO, our country is one of the top ten countries in the world for rates of erosion spread, and by 2002 erosion will have affected up to 75 percent of our agricultural lands. One can cite other more detailed and sad statistics on Russian land. I am putting them at the end of this book.</p><p>Now, having familiarized myself with the figures above, I can say with confidence that Anastasia's project can halt the riotous waste of the land resources of our state. To date, it is only one that is effective and realistic. It envisages the restoration of soil fertility through the deployment of natural processes. It does not require additional state capital investments. Moreover, it solves the problem of ecology, refugees, and unemployment and obviates the problems we create for our children by our present-day attitude toward the land.</p><p>There may be a more effective and realistic project, but if there is, someone should make it public. Right now, certain structures are merely demanding large sums of money to restore agriculture the old way. The state does not have the sums they demand. Saddest of all, however, is that if money is found through foreign loans, say, and they start pushing chemical fertilizers into the land, they will foul the soil even more, since we do not have manure in sufficient quantities.</p><p>The money will later have to be paid back with interest, the land will deteriorate even more, and the problem will be laid on the shoulders of the rising generation. I am going to apply all my efforts to advocate Anastasia's project. Of course, the taiga hermit is no authority for most officials, and I'm not an agrarian specialist, It would be hard for me to prove its effectiveness to our wise politicians, but I am still going to act by all means available to me.</p><p>I will be grateful to those readers who can unsnarl bureaucratic tangles and explain to senior men of state in more professional language the effectiveness of Anastasia's project. This book may wind up in power structures capable of taking on these tasks. Therefore, I turn to them once again as with a petition in the name of everyone who wishes to build a homestead. I don't know how many petitioners there will be, but I'm convinced there will be millions of them. I ask politicians for the following:</p><p>Resolve the land question at the legislative level and allocate to each Russian family that so desires one hectare of land apiece. Provide the opportunity free of charge for each of our state's families who so wishes to establish their own homestead, ennoble it, and tend it with love. Then the greater homeland, too, will be beautiful and happy, since it will be made up of these small pieces.</p><p>Question: Many regions of our country are in a difficult ecological situation. You might say that this situation has become catastrophic. Wouldn't it be better first to apply our efforts to improving the ecological situation as a whole, as many ecological organizations are doing now, and then worry about individual homesteads?</p><p>Answer: You yourself say that many organizations are working on the ecological situation, yet it is deteriorating. Doesn't this mean that concern alone is insufficient here since the situation continues to deteriorate and has even become catastrophic? Let's imagine a beautiful orchard and different trees growing altogether on one beautifully laid-out homestead—just one heavenly corner, one hectare in size. This is not enough, of course, for a global change in the ecology of the country or the planet. But let us picture a million corners like this and we will see the entire Earth as a blooming, heavenly garden. But it all has to start with each one setting up his own corner. Maybe then we can move on from universal concern to universal specific actions.</p><p>Question: Do you believe that an unemployed family could become rich with the help of one hectare of their own land? If you think that, then why is today's countryside idle? People have land in the countryside, but they're starving.</p><p>Answer: Let us think about this phenomenon together, but I will add preliminarily a few more questions to the one you raise.</p><p>Why do millions of people say that the 400 to 500 square meters of land of their dacha garden was a substantial material support and significantly improved their ration of nourishment, whereas people in villages who have 15,000 to 25,000 square meters say, "We're starving, we're poor"?</p><p>Why? Doesn't our well-being also depend on our level of consciousness? The majority of the rural population believes that one can live well only in cities. Therefore young people are leaving the village. I think our recent propaganda is to blame for this phenomenon. Let's recall the ecstatic articles in the press in the 1950s and 1960s. Who are the heroes? Miners, loggers, lathe operators, pilots, sailors.</p><p>Artists even drew pictures of urban landscapes with lots of smoking stacks from industrial giants. Occasionally they would also mention the collective farmer condescendingly, but they gave a negative picture of anyone paying attention to the land of his plot. They even made attempts to build urban-style buildings in rural locations, thereby depriving people of their own yards and forcing them to work only on so-called public land. It's all as it is in India's Auroville. You can live and work on the land, but it still won't be your land; all this leads to a lamentable result.</p><p>Both politicians and the media talk constantly about the universal poverty of the modern countryside, as well as the majority of the population. They say it so much that it produces a kind of wide-scale suggestion that the rural inhabitant can only be poor. Examples are almost never cited showing that your well-being depends largely on you yourself. It is advantageous for some to put the following into practice: "Don't rely on yourself, only I can make you happy." This is what many leaders of religious confessions and many politicians say as they assemble an electorate for themselves. Anyone who wants to be poor and miserable, continue believing them. I want to talk about how to become rich, not poor. To the question of whether one can live comfortably having one's own scrap of land, I reply, Yes! And I will cite a specific example.</p><p>In 1999, a Moscow entrepreneur I know who had read Anastasia invited me for a visit. He intrigued me by saying he could lay a table almost identical to Anastasia's in the taiga. When I arrived at his place, the table was still empty. We were sitting and talking, and Andrei—that was the entrepreneur's name—was glancing at his watch, apologizing that someone had been detained.</p><p>Soon after, his driver walked in with two large baskets. Tomatoes, cucumbers, bread, and much else appeared on the table. The room filled with enticing aromas. The women laid a beautiful table in a few minutes. We drank a magnificent, fragrant Russian kvass rather than Pepsi. We drank homemade wine rather than French cognac, and it was also infused with herbs. The tomatoes and cucumbers were not as wonderful as Anastasia's in the taiga, but they tasted much better than the ones sold in supermarkets and even at the farmers' markets. "Where did you get all this?" I asked, baffled, and I learned the following from him.</p><p>Returning to Moscow from Ryazan once, Andrei's driver stopped his SUV at a small roadside market. They bought a liter jar of pickles and a jar of tomatoes. Stopping at a small café, they decided to eat. They opened the jars they'd bought and tasted. After dinner, Andrei told his driver to turn around and go back to the roadside market. He bought up from an elderly woman everything she had and offered to take her home in his SUV. The woman lived alone in a very old little house with a small vegetable garden. Her home was located in a tiny village fifteen kilometers from the road. Andrei's enterprising mind quickly set to work, and this is what happened. . . .</p><p>Andrei bought a house in the country, on the edge of the forest, with 20,000 square meters of land 120 kilometers from Moscow in an ecologically clean zone. He registered the house in this woman's name and placed before her the documents and contract, according to which he was required to pay her US$300 monthly and she, in turn, was required to raise food in the garden and give it to his family, except for what she ate herself. The woman's name was Nadezhda Ivanovna, and she was sixty-one. She didn't really understand or believe the papers. Then Andrei took her to the village council and asked the chairman to read the papers and explain their legality. The chairman of the village council looked over the papers and told the woman, "What
 do you lose, Ivanovna? No one is asking for your broken-down home in exchange, after all. If you don't like it, you can return home for good." Eventually, Nadezhda Ivanovna agreed.</p><p>Now she's been living in her sturdy house for three years. Andrei hired workers to drill a well, put in heating and a self-contained furnace, and dig out and equip a cellar. They surrounded the whole farm with a fence, brought in all the essential equipment, and bought a goat, chickens, and feed. And many other things needed on a farm.</p><p>Nadezhda Ivanovna's daughter and young grandson came to live with her. Since reading what Anastasia said about growing vegetables, Andrei has grown the seedlings himself, but he takes the seeds only from Nadezhda Ivanovna. Andrei's father, a former restaurant director, now retired, takes the seedlings out in the summer and happily helps the women on the farm. Nadezhda Ivanovna and her daughter got housing and work. Andrei's family—he, his wife, his father, and his two children—are provided all summer with fresh, truly organic vegetables and fruits, and in the winter with magnificent pickled ones, and year round, as necessary, with medicinal herbs.</p><p>Some will regard that as an exception. Nothing of the kind! Ten years ago, when I was the president of the Interregional Association of Entrepreneurs of Siberia, many of the entrepreneurs who belonged to it tried to set up their own farms in a similar manner, some for their own firm, some just for their family. Right now you can read announcements in the newspapers offering similar services. There is one "but," however. It is very hard to find someone capable of working, or rather who knows how to do what Nadezhda Ivanovna does. And since it is so hard, we must try to remember ourselves how we should treat the land. Let us exchange experience as to how to become rich and happy on one's own land, not how to be poor.</p><p>Question: Vladimir Nikolaevich, I am an entrepreneur, and I too know that many wealthy people use the services of rural residents capable of intelligently cultivating and storing agricultural output that truly does surpass that produced on large farms for taste. But with mass production, demand will decline, then how is the family which has income only from its own hectare of land going to exist, if it turns out that no one needs the tomatoes and cucumbers they grow?</p><p>Answer: Many things besides tomatoes and cucumbers grow on the land. However, if even half of Russian families acquire their own homestead, they will not be able to satisfy the demand for their output for the next twenty to thirty years because, not only Russians, but many other countries, especially wealthy foreign ones, will need it. The problem is that the agricultural producers of most countries have been so carried away by hybridizing and chemical treatment of plants that they have simply destroyed their primordial aspect, by which I mean not their outward appearance, but the fullness of their content. If we're talking about cucumbers and tomatoes, then each person can be convinced independently, based on this example, of the following.</p><p>Go into an average or, even better, good supermarket, which are no rarity now in the big cities. On the shelf you will see very handsome imported tomatoes and cucumbers. The price for them begins at thirty rubles per kilogram. They are identical in size and handsome and sometimes are even sold with their green stem. But they have no smell or taste. They are mutants! This is an illusion, a model that outwardly recalls what should be. Most of the world now feeds on mutants like this. This is not my discovery. People in many countries of the West that we consider highly developed are disturbed by this.</p><p>For example, in Germany a decision was issued that store labels must indicate that vegetables were produced with the use of specific additives, so those people who are better off will avoid buying them. Food grown in ecologically clean regions with the limited use of chemical fertilizers costs significantly more in the West. However, the farming system that exists in the West does not permit the cultivation of completely organic food. The Western farmer is forced to use the labor of hired workers, all kinds of equipment, chemical fertilizers, and chemical herbicides.</p><p>He strives to obtain the greatest profit. Suppose a Western farmer decides to grow organic vegetables—and such farmers already exist—according to Anastasia's directions. If you remember, she talked about how all the weeds should not be destroyed because they have their own specific function in producing a harvest. But let's say a farmer still does want to grow this kind of food for his own family and acquaintances. He will face a problem that is difficult to solve: seeds. Breeding has done its work, and the primordial type no longer exists in the West. Indeed, there is very little of it in Russia, especially since they gave permission for the sale of an imported seed fund. If you use seeds from your own plot, your vegetable crop will gradually aim to restore its primordial properties and take everything man requires from the earth, but complete restoration takes decades. In Russia, perhaps thanks to its poverty and the many small farms, many people use their own seeds, and herein lies their advantage, for soon it will pay off a hundredfold on the material level as well.</p><p>We are talking about seeds, about the need to cultivate agricultural output in ecologically clean zones and about rejecting chemical fertilizers—all this is correct, and people have been talking about this in various countries of the world, but only talking. There is not enough delicious and healthy agricultural output, especially in highly developed countries. But this is still not all. Processing! Preserving!</p><p>Despite all the efforts of our technocratic world, technically highly-equipped combines cannot produce pickled tomatoes, cucumbers, and cabbage that surpass in taste the qualities of those made by many Russian grandmothers. What is their secret? Despite all their wisdom, few know that not more than fifteen minutes should pass from the moment a tomato or cucumber is picked from the garden where it is growing to its preservation. The shorter that period, the better. Than the marvelous aroma, ethers, and aura are preserved. The same applies to the flavorings added—dill, for example.</p><p>Water has tremendous significance. How can anything we can obtain be good if it uses dead, chlorinated water? We boil it and steam the jar, but if people who use spring water add to it, besides everything else, fox berries . . . Want to try it? Take spring water, add one third fox berries, and you will be drinking this water with pleasure even six months later.</p><p>Preserved vegetables and fruits prepared by hand by many Russian adepts differ markedly for the better. They surpass in taste qualities the output of even the most famous firms in the world, as a taste comparison will convince you. Now let us imagine that a family living on its homestead has rolled out a thousand liter jars of tomatoes and cucumbers. This is first-class food that surpasses other food on many parameters—food that has no equal in the world for its taste and ecological purity, food that many people from different countries of the world, including America's billionaires and tourists vacationing at Cyprus resorts, would like to have for their table. And the jar labels would say: "From the Ivanov homestead," "From the Petrov homestead," "From the Sidorov homestead."</p><p>Of course, entrepreneurs are not interested in selling one thousand liter jars. But if there are, say, three hundred homesteads in a settlement, then they would produce three hundred thousand jars, and this is now an interesting business even for a large firm. I think that the initial price of a single jar would be the same as it is now in the supermarket, no more than one dollar, but when people have tried it the price will rise, maybe even tenfold.</p><p>I have cited cucumbers and tomatoes merely as an example. There is still much else that can be produced on a homestead, for example, wine, fruit liqueurs, berry—currant, raspberry, blackberry, and sweet rowan—liqueurs, and much else. Each would comprise a "bouquet" itself, achieving increasing perfection. No super-expensive, elite wines will compare with them. There is no raw material for wine in the world like what we have in Russia. In addition, wines can be manufactured according to ancient recipes, with the use of herbs, for beneficial, vitamin-rich wines.</p><p>Anastasia says that soon the Russian hand embroidered, side-buttoned shirt will be considered the most fashionable in the world. We can be thinking along these lines as well. Hand-carved wood objects can be produced on the homestead in the winter. In general, folk wisdom says, "If you want to be happy, be happy." One might also say, "If you want to be rich, be rich." The main thing is not to program yourself for poverty. You should make up your mind to be rich. You must think much more rationally about how to become wealthy and not tell yourself that it is impossible to do so.</p><p>Question: Anastasia says that it is much easier for newlyweds to preserve their love in the conditions of the kind of homestead you describe than in an ordinary apartment. Tell me, please, have you spoken about this with psychologists and scientists working on the problems of the family and, if so, what do they say on this subject. How can this come about?</p><p>Answer: I have not spoken to scientists about this. I am not very interested in how love is preserved. The main thing is that it is. You may be able to convince yourself that it does by asking, Where would you like to see your son or daughter living: in an apartment, like a stone sack, or in a house surrounded by a beautiful garden?</p><p>Think about it. What would you like to feed your daughter,
 son, or grandchildren, canned food or fresh, organic food? And finally, would you like to see your children healthy or living at the expense of the pharmacy? Ask your young wife this question. Given identical feelings for two men, which would she prefer to marry: one who has arranged his own daily life, his own future family nest in an apartment building, or in a house with a beautiful garden? I think the majority would choose the latter.</p><p>Comment: The resurrection of any country can begin only with its spiritual awakening. Members of our government and our president have understood this and begun to speak about spirituality. Anastasia considers the majority of her readers to be highly spiritual individuals living by the laws of God the Creator. She speaks about spiritual values, but you are leading people away, into their own private lives, and calling on them to engage in business on their own parcel. In this way you are leading people away from spirituality.</p><p>Answer: Ultimately, I believe that no one could ever lead humanity away from true values. It is good that modern rulers are talking about spirituality. Anastasia's statements, which were not always comprehensible to me in the beginning, subsequently have been taking concrete shape anyway. I find what is concrete more understandable than philosophical ruminations, which is why I talk about specific things, considering them the most important on the spiritual level as well. There are probably quite a few concepts of spirituality and God in the world.</p><p>After my interaction with Anastasia, I too came to make sense of what had happened. For me, God is the individual—a good, intelligent, and life-affirming individual who strives for people's happiness, both for their children and for every person individually. God is the Father who loves and suffers for each person. Having presented each with complete freedom of choice, God is the wisest individual striving each instant to do only good for his children. His sun rises every day, and the grass and flowers grow. The trees grow, the clouds float by, and the water gurgles, ready at any moment to slake the thirst of any person.</p><p>I do not believe and would never come to believe that our wise Father could consider constant conversations about spirituality alone, without concrete actions, to be the achievement of spirituality.</p><p>Ever since the so-called Iron Curtain vanished, a horde of various spiritual prophets from all over has flooded our country. Quite a few homegrown ones have appeared as well.</p><p>They all try to tell us what God the Father wants from us. Some say you have to eat a certain way. Others teach which words are best addressed to God; still others, such as Krishnaites, say that we should hop around and chant mantras from morning until night. But for me this is simply nonsense. I am convinced that no greater pain could be conceived for God than this kind of grimacing, hopping, and howling. Any loving parent tries to make sure his son or daughter continues the family business and takes part in joint creation with him. God's direct creations are around us. What could be a higher manifestation of the love for God than a protective attitude toward these creations, than arranging one's children's and one's own life with the help of these Divine creations?</p><p>Neither the country as a whole nor any individual has become happier from all this grimacing and meditating. We have not become happier because it is they who are leading us away from the truth, from God. They are leading us away forcibly, relentlessly, suggesting more and more new versions of grimacing as the truth. Teachings come and go. Some of them exist for centuries and then only make us laugh; others appear for a few years and vanish without a trace, like a flare. After them, we have only their trash, filth, and broken human destinies to look at.</p><p>To the question of why we are forced to listen constantly to different words about God from the mouths of these prophets and why God does not speak words to us directly, Anastasia replied, "Words? There are so many words with different meanings among various peoples, so many dissimilar languages and dialects. But there is one language of Divine appeals. It is woven from the rustling of leaves, the singing of birds, and the waves. God's language has smells and color. God gives a prayerful answer in this language to each request and prayer."</p><p>God speaks with us every moment, but is it out of our spiritual laziness that we do not want to hear Him? Here I will sing a mantra, hop, and sprinkle manna from heaven, and God will make me happy and make me chosen above all others. Once and for all! But we must spend years setting up our own paradise, waiting for fruit-yielding trees to grow and flowers to blossom. But by not doing this, we do not simply reject God, we offend Him. We demean Him with our endless talk and grimaces.</p><p>You do not have to listen to Anastasia, let alone me. But ultimately you will walk into a springtime forest or garden and falling silent, listen closely to your heart. The hearts of many will certainly hear the voice of the Father, who, according to Anastasia, when asked what God can do when the energy of destruction dominates everyone on Earth, when by invoking His name for their own benefit, some people think they can suddenly subordinate others, replied, "With the coming day I will rise as the dawn. The Sun's ray, caressing all creations on Earth, without exception, will help My daughters and sons understand that each can speak with me, soul to Soul." He has always believed in us, saying, "There is one main obstacle to the diversity of reasons leading to an impasse, to nowhere; it will be a bar to everything that bears a lie. My sons and daughters aspire to understanding the truth. A lie always has bounds, but the truth is boundless. It is one and understanding will always be found in the soul of My daughters and sons!"</p><p>Let each person make haste to find in his soul the consciousness of a son of God, not a slave or half-witted biorobot hopping around to bells.</p><p>But how much can one ask for oneself from God? Please, lift me up, free me? Isn't it time for us to do something nice for our Father? And what might be nice and bring joy to Him? Responding to a similar question, Anastasia spoke about a simple test that can help you verify many spiritual concepts and trends. She said, "When your soul is stirred by an assertion coming from someone's lips supposedly in the name of God, pay attention to how the prophet himself lives, and then imagine what would happen to the world if everyone started living like that." This simple test can help clarify a great deal. I tried to imagine what would happen to humanity if each and every person on Earth began chanting mantras from morning until night, as the Krishnaites do, and I immediately got the end of the world. Now imagine that each person on Earth cultivated his own garden, then of course the entire Earth would be transformed into a flowering, heavenly garden.</p><p>I am an entrepreneur, or used to be, but nonetheless the entrepreneur is certainly a specificity that is close to me, and perhaps for this reason I believe that a person can be considered spiritual if he is capable of undertaking actions beneficial to the Earth, his family, and his parents, that is, to God. If someone who calls himself spiritual cannot make himself, the woman he loves, his family, and his children happy, then that is pseudo-spirituality.</p><p>Question: Anastasia spoke about a qualitatively new way to raise children, about a new school. Is it possible only in the conditions of the settlement she has outlined or is it in large modern cities, too? What does Shchetinin say about this? Back in the first book, Anastasia was quoted as saying that she believes the raising of children to be the most important thing and she has always tried to talk about education, but you constantly skirt this issue and barely any light is shed on it in your books. Why?</p><p>Answer: Mikhail Petrovich Shchetinin organized his boarding school in the forest. As soon as the first settlement consisting of individual homesteads is begun to be laid out, we must ask Mikhail Petrovich to develop a special program for the future school. I will ask him, if he himself cannot teach in it, then to send us his best students and select appropriate teachers from among those working there now.</p><p>I do not believe it is possible to organize a school like this in today's cities. Let us recall, without Anastasia, our own school years. In school, people say one thing, in public another, and in the family something else. By the time you understand where the truth lies, by the time you try to obtain an integral perception of the world, you look and half your life has passed. I think we ourselves need to learn to live decently before we try to educate our own children. Once we have arranged a worthy human existence, we can worry about our children and schools, acting in unison, complementing one another.</p><p>Anastasia does indeed often speak about rearing the child, but what she says does not resemble any system scheduled by the day, hour, and minute. Frequently her statements are not all that understandable in general. For example, she says that parents must begin raising their child by raising themselves, by arranging their own happy existence, with their own attempts to touch the thoughts of God. One of the main elements of an education is, in fact, a beautiful homestead.</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0518>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>18.

He lives in a district of prestigious dachas outside Moscow. His two sons, who hold fairly high state posts, built a large two-story home for their elderly father and hired
 a housekeeper to look after the house and their father. They check in on their father at best on his birthday.</p><p>His name is Nikolai Fyodorovich, and he is over seventy. His legs are weak so he spends nearly all his time in his imported wheelchair. Half of the enormous house's first floor, furnished in the best European style, is taken up by his library, which has a large number of books in different languages. The books, primarily on philosophical topics, are expensive editions. Before retiring, Nikolai Fyodorovich taught philosophy at a prestigious Moscow university and holds advanced degrees. When he got older, he moved into this house and spent nearly all his time, reading and thinking, in his library.</p><p>I met him thanks to the persistence of his housekeeper, Galina, who came to one of my readers conferences. Now I am grateful to her for this introduction.</p><p>Nikolai Fyodorovich had read my books about Anastasia, and it was interesting to talk with him. Despite his academic degrees, this old man could explain in simple, intelligible language what was not always understandable in Anastasia's statements or discover new facets in them.</p><p>After my third book, "The Dimension of Love," came out, the secretariat of the city of Vladimir's Anastasia Foundation passed on to me several letters in which different leaders of certain religious confessions spoke out in very aggressive form against Anastasia. They called her a fool and a scoundrel, and one even wrote a long letter filled with obscenities.</p><p>I could not understand why Anastasia had suddenly evoked in some leaders of religious confessions out-and-out aggression, and I sent several such letters on to Nikolai Fyodorovich for him to express his opinion. Two months later, after seeking me out in my hotel, his housekeeper Galina showed up and began asking me agitatedly and exigently to go immediately to see Nikolai Fyodorovich and talk with him because she was worried about his health. It was hard to withstand the pressure from Galina.</p><p>Nikolai Fyodorovich's housekeeper is a woman of large and luxuriant build, not fat, but simply a big and physically strong Russian woman of forty or forty-five. She had lived most of her life in a Ukrainian village and worked as a tractor driver, driver, and cattle farm worker. She's a good cook, knows her herbs, and is very neat. When she's upset, she speaks with a strong Ukrainian accent.</p><p>I don't know how Nikolai Fyodorovich's sons found her to become a nurse for their father, but it was strange to watch the old, intellectual professor of philosophy interacting with the poorly educated country woman. Galina lived in one of the rooms of his house. It would have been fine if she had just taken care of the housekeeping, which she did well, but she had to listen to what Nikolai Fyodorovich and I were talking about. She had to pick up work somewhere nearby, start dusting somewhere, and also commenting out loud, as if talking to herself, on what she was hearing.</p><p>This time, Galina came for me in the Niva automobile Nikolai Fyodorovich's sons had bought so that she could drive to town for food, to the forest for herbs, and for medicines for their father. Setting aside my work, I went with her. When we were driving through Moscow, Galina was silent because it was tense driving through the city. A drop of sweat even formed on her forehead until she reached the loop road. Once she had come out on the familiar highway, Galina said, "Oof. We made it out." After that she drove more freely and started telling me quickly about her worries, mixing Ukrainian and Russian:</p><p>"He was so peaceful. He sat for days at a time in his wheelchair, reading his books, thinking. In the morning I'd give him some nice hot buckwheat cereal or oatmeal. I'd feed him and perhaps go to the market, or at least to the forest to gather herbs that are good for your health. I could go with a calm heart, knowing he would think his thoughts in his chair or read a book. Now everything is different. I brought him the letters you sent. He read them. Before two days passed after he'd read them, he said to me, 'Take some money, Galina Nikiforovna, and go buy the books about Anastasia, and then, when you go to the market, don't hurry home. Stay at the market and observe people. When you see someone who is sad or ill, give him a book.' That's what I did, I did it twice, but he still could not calm down. 'Don't hurry for dinnertime, Galina Nikiforovna,' he says. 'I'll feed myself if I get hungry.' But I always got back for dinner anyway.</p><p>"A few days ago I came back from the market and stopped into his book room to give him some broth to drink. I looked, and his wheelchair was empty, and he was lying on the carpet face down. I went to the phone, picked up the receiver to call the doctors, the way his sons told me. They gave me a special number, not one everyone else has. I dialed it. 'Help, help,' I shouted into the phone. And he lifted his head from the carpet and said to me, 'Cancel your call, Galina Nikiforovna. I'm fine. I'm doing physical exercises, pushing up from the floor.' I leapt over to him, lifted him in one try from the floor, and put him in his chair. How could he get up from the floor himself with his sick legs? 'What exercises,' I said to him, 'when a person is lying on the floor and not moving?' And he replied, 'I've already done my exercises and was just resting. You shouldn't have worried.'</p><p>"The next day he climbed out of his chair himself and onto the floor again for his exercises. That's when I bought him weights. No, not weights—it's called an expander. It has handles and elastics. If you want, you attach one elastic to make the exercise easier to do, and if you want, four, when you get the strength. I bought him an expander, and he still would get up from his chair, just like a foolish child. After all, his heart's not so young anymore. And since it's not, you shouldn't do anything hard right away, you need the stamina. But he's like a foolish child. It's nearly five years since I've been working for him, and nothing like it has ever happened before. Even I don't know what's going on inside me now. Talk to him. Tell him to take it easy with his exercises because people love him. Tell him to build up his stamina."</p><p>When I walked into Nikolai Fyodorovich's spacious study, the fireplace was lit. The old philosophy professor was sitting not as usual, in his wheelchair, but at a large desk, writing and drawing something. Even his outward appearance spoke to the changes that had taken place in him. He wasn't wearing his robe as usual but a shirt and tie. He greeted me more energetically than usual, quickly offered me a chair, and immediately, without any introductory "how are you" and so on, began speaking. This time Nikolai Fyodorovich spoke heatedly and energetically:</p><p>"Do you know what beautiful times are coming on Earth, Vladimir? I would like to live on an Earth like that, not die. I read the correspondence with the swearing at Anastasia. Thank you for sending it to me. I realized a great deal thanks to it. They called the taiga hermit Anastasia a sorceress and a witch, but she is the greatest warrior. Yes, yes, imagine, Anastasia is the greatest warrior of the forces of light. It will be up to our descendants to understand her importance and magnitude. The human consciousness, the intellect and emotions in the tales, epics, and legends that have come down to us, could not even imagine the greatness of this warrior. Just don't be surprised, please, Vladimir, don't put yourself on your guard, as is your habit, regarding Anastasia. She is a human being as well, a woman with the entire—absolutely the entire—human essence, with all the feminine weaknesses and virtues, and the maternal predestination, but she is simultaneously a great warrior. Just a second! I'll try to explain myself in a less muddled fashion. It's all contained in her philosophical conception. On the shelf of my study, you see many books, Vladimir. These are the philosophical works of thinkers of various eras and various parts of the world."</p><p>Gesturing to his bookshelves, Nikolai Fyodorovich, enumerated them:</p><p>"Classical rhetoric that speaks about the vital, animated body of the cosmos. Next to it, what was written about Socrates, since he himself wrote nothing. Here to the right, Lucretius, Plutarch, and Marcus Aurelius. A little lower on the shelves, the five long poems by Nezâmi Ganjevi. After that, Arani, Descartes, Franklin, Kant, Laplace, Hegel, and Stendhal. Everyone was attempting to learn the essence of things, to touch the laws of the Universe. This is what Durant said about them: 'The history of philosophy is essentially an account of the efforts great men have made to avert social disintegration by building up natural moral sanctions to take the place of the supernatural sanctions which they themselves have destroyed.'</p><p>"The great thinkers have tried to approach the concept of the Absolute, each in his own way. Philosophical trends that resemble religions have arisen out of their philosophical concepts and died. As a result, having vanquished timid efforts at resistance, the dominant concept in our life has been, to put it briefly, the concept of subordination to some Supreme Intellect. It doesn't matter where it is—in the limitless expanses of the universe or localized in the essence of an individual human soul. What is important is something else. What is important is the predominance over all of the concept of subordination and worship. Then come the particulars—subordination to a teacher, a mentor, a ritual. I have the predictions of Nostradamus on these shelves as well. Taken together they form a philosophical concept: man is transitory, man is immoral and insignificant, he has much to learn. This concept is exactly what has been twisting and destroying the human soul. An adherent to this concept cannot
 be happy. No person on Earth can be happy given the dominance of a concept like this in the human consciousness.</p><p>"It looms over both philosopher and the person who has never had any contact with philosophical works. It looms over the newborn child and the old man. It even looms over the fetus in its mother's womb. There are many adherents of this concept today. They have existed at various times. Today their followers instill the human community with the frailty and insignificance of the human essence. But no! Other times are at hand! For me, the words from God which Anastasia conveyed were like a blaze of light. You wrote them down, Vladimir, and I remember them.</p><p>"When Adam asked God, 'Where is the Universe's edge? What will I do when I come to it? When will I fill everything myself and create what I have imagined?' God answered His son and all of us, 'My son, the Universe is a thought, the dream was born out of a thought, it is partially visible in matter. When you reach the edge of everything, your thought will discover a new beginning and continuation. A beautiful new birth will arise out of nothing, reflecting you and your aspirations, soul, and dream. My son, you are infinite, you are eternal, your creative dreams are in you.'</p><p>"The greatest, all-clarifying, philosophically all-embracing, precise, and laconic answer. It stands above all the philosophical definitions put together. You see, Vladimir, I have many books here on the shelves of my library, but I do not have the main book, the one that is immeasurably more precious than all the philosophical works ever published put together. Many have seen this book, but few have been given to read it. The language of this book cannot be studied, but it can be felt."</p><p>"What language is this?"</p><p>"The language of God, Vladimir. I remember what Anastasia said about it: 'There are so many words with different meanings among earthly nations. So many dissimilar languages and dialects. And there is one language for all. One language of Divine appeals for all. It is woven from the rustling of leaves, the singing of birds, and the waves. The Divine language has smells and color. God gives a prayerful answer in this language to each request and prayer.' Anastasia feels and understands this language, but what about us? How could we have failed to notice it for centuries? Logic! Iron logic speaks to the fact that if God created the Earth and the living nature around us, then the grasses, trees, clouds, water, and stars are nothing but His materialized thought.</p><p>"But not only do we pay no attention to them, we trample, break, and spoil them, all the while speaking about faith. What faith? Who do we in fact worship? 'The succession of secular rulers, no matter what temples they've erected, will be remembered by their descendants only for the dirt they had to take from them. Water is the criterion for everything, but with each passing day the water gets dirtier and dirtier.' That is what Anastasia said. Only the greatest philosopher could speak like that, and it is up to all of us to give it careful thought. Think, Vladimir. Any structure, even if it is religious, is frail, as is religion itself. Religions come and go, and when they go, they take their temples and philosophies with them. Water has existed since the world's creation, as have we. For the most part, we, too, consist of water."</p><p>"Nikolai Fyodorovich, why do you consider Anastasia's definitions the most correct?"</p><p>"Because they are taken from the main book. And their logic, Vladimir, is a philosophical logic. There is the previous phrase in the name of God where to all beings of the universe, to the question, 'What do you desire so ardently?' God answered, 'Joint creation and joy for all from its contemplation.'</p><p>"A brief phrase! Just a few words! God's aspiration and desire is expressed in just a few words. None of the great philosophers were ever able to provide a more precise and accurate definition. 'Reality must define itself,' Anastasia said. Let every parent who loves his children determine whether he isn't dreaming of the same thing. Who of us, the sons and daughters of God, would not want joint creation with our children and joy from its contemplation?</p><p>"Anastasia's philosophical definitions hold the greatest power and wisdom. They are fateful for humanity! They are effective. The horde foretelling the darkness will try to resist them. Nonetheless, they will manifest themselves, and not only in the way they have in the curses aimed at Anastasia. They will manifest themselves variously. Numbers of feeble prophets, having gathered a handful of followers, will trumpet the supposed truth to people too lazy to think independently.</p><p>"Anastasia said about them previously, 'Oh you who call yourselves teachers of human souls, cool your ardor now, and let everyone know that The Creator gives each person everything from the beginning, and each person has the Truth in his soul from the beginning. All he needs to do is shut the great creations off from the darkness of postulates and fictions.' It is they who are attacking Anastasia, because Anastasia is devastating their ideas. Her philosophical conception calls off the end of the world, and this is our present reality. We are witnesses to and participants in the most beautiful accomplishments. We are on the threshold of a new millennium. We are entering a new reality. We are already living in that reality."</p><p>"Wait a minute, Nikolai Fyodorovich. I didn't understand the part about reality and actions. Let's say one philosopher said something, and a second. Anastasia also says it. So what do reality and actions have to do with this? Just the words are the same. Philosophers speak, but life itself takes its own course."</p><p>"The life of any human community has always been built, as it is now, under the influence of philosophical concepts. The Israelites' philosophy is one way of life; the Crusaders' philosophy, another. Hitler had his own philosophy, and here, under Soviet rule, we had ours. A revolution is nothing but the replacement of one philosophical concept by another. But these are all specifics conditioned by the confines of the scope. What Anastasia has already created is more global. It has an effect on the human community as a whole and on each of its members separately. She said, 'I will carry people across the dark forces' span of time.' She did that, Vladimir. She laid a bridge across the abyss for each person, and each is himself free to walk across it or not.</p><p>"I'm a philosopher, Vladimir, I can see this well now, and what is more important, I can feel it. On the threshold of the new millennium, her philosophical concept has blazed up like a vivid ray. Each person acts through his deeds every hour, one way or another, depending on his philosophical convictions. If one's philosophical convictions change, so do one's actions. Here, for example, I was sitting in my study, rereading various philosophical works, and pitying all humanity, which was moving inexorably toward its death. I wondered where my sons and grandsons would bury me, whether they would to my funeral, or whether it would be too much trouble for my grandsons to come to see their grandfather. I pitied all humanity and thought about my own death. Then came Anastasia, with her completely different philosophical concept, and my actions are different."</p><p>"How, for example, are your actions different?"</p><p>"Like this. Right now I'm going to stand up and begin to act thanks to this new philosophical concept."</p><p>Nikolai Fyodorovich leaned on the table and holding onto an armchair and shelf, with difficulty, but nonetheless on his weak legs walked over to one of the bookshelves. He examined the titles on the book spines and then pulled out a book in an expensive binding and headed for the fireplace, holding onto different furniture in his study. He reached the fireplace, tossed the book he'd taken off the shelf into the flame, and announced, "Those were Nostradamus's predictions about all kinds of cataclysms and the end of the world. Do you remember what Anastasia said, Vladimir? You should remember them, as I did: 'Nostradamus, you did not predict the dates of terrible cataclysms for the Earth. You created them through your thought and engaged human thought to embody something terrible. Even now they are hovering over the Earth, frightening people with despair.' Only the greatest philosopher could say that, someone who understands that a prediction is nothing but a modeling of the future. The more people believe in the universal end, the greater the number of human thoughts will begin modeling it—and it will come to pass.</p><p>"It might come to pass because human thought is material and it can create something material. Entire sects at different ends of the world set themselves on fire and do so believing in the end, they live believing in the predictions. However, she, defying despair, destroys the thought of the world's end by saying, 'But it will not come to pass now, so let your thought do battle with mine. I am a human being. I am Anastasia, and I am stronger than you.' She also says, 'All the evil on earth, leave your affairs behind and rush toward me. Do battle with me, just try.' And also: 'With my Ray I will burn up the host of age-old postulates in one instant.' She went out alone to battle the countless hordes. Against the millions of those who are modeling the demise of all humanity, she came out to do battle. At the same time, she does not want to draw us into the battle. She merely wants us to be happy, which is why she says in her prayer to God:</p><p> </p><p>'The coming ages shall all live in Your dream.</p><p>And so it shall be! I want this so! I am Your daughter,</p><p>My Father, who is everywhere.'</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And she will have her way. Her philosophy is unusually powerful. The coming ages will all live in the Divine dream, in beautiful, heavenly
 gardens, and she will not distract anyone with her memory. They will not erect monuments to her and remember her when it becomes clear to everyone where what is truly human lies. People will revel in the Divine condition and will not remember her. But flowers will bloom in different gardens, and among them one beautiful flower will be called Anastasia.</p><p>"I am old, but I want to be her foot soldier today. Vladimir, you say philosophy is nothing but words. But my heart received these words, uttered somewhere far away in the taiga, with delight, and here you have before you concrete, material actions; it is not humanity that is burning in the fire but the predictions of humanity's demise. This is why adherents of that demise have become agitated and closed ranks. Those who have built their own philosophy on this, who have blackmailed people with the supposedly inevitable end of the world, have become agitated."</p><p>"Hasn't anyone spoken out against the end of the world before Anastasia?"</p><p>"There have been timid and thus insignificant attempts. No one paid them any mind. No one has ever spoken the way she has before. Human hearts have never accepted anyone's words with such readiness and joy. No other philosophical concept has ever drawn people to it like this. But hers is drawing people. It is vanquishing a host of ages-old postulates.</p><p>"How she has done this is not for us to sort out yet. There is also an unusual rhythm in her words, and a great logic, and maybe something else as well. Maybe . . . Yes! Undoubtedly! This sentence of hers: 'He who creates shone with some new energy and spoke in a new way about what we see each day.' Undoubtedly, a new energy has appeared in the Universe, and more and more new people of our era have begun to possess it. The fact is that it usually takes decades, perhaps even centuries, to disseminate a significant philosophical concept. But in mere years, she has accomplished this. It's stunning! Vladimir, you thought her words were simply words. But her words are so powerful that these hands here"—he raised one hand, looked at it, and added—"even my old hands are making her words come to life. And the end of the world is burning up in the flame. Life will continue. These very hands might still help life continue, the hands of Anastasia's foot soldier."</p><p>Holding on to furniture, Nikolai Fyodorovich walked over to the table and picked up a water pitcher. Leaning one hand on the wall, he headed for the window, with difficulty, slowly, but he reached the window where there was a handsome pot. A very small green shoot was growing out of the dirt in the pot.</p><p>"There, it's come up at last, my little cedar. And now these hands of mine will water it, making the words close to my heart real."</p><p>Nikolai Fyodorovich leaned sideways toward the windowsill, picked up the water pitcher with both hands and spoke: "I hope the water isn't too cold for you." He thought a moment, took some water into his mouth, held it there briefly, and leaning on the windowsill, released the water from his mouth in a thin stream onto the dirt next to the green shoot. Galina was in the study during our conversation. The whole time she kept inventing something to do in order to stay in the study. First she brought tea, then she started dusting, all the while softly muttering to herself, commenting on what she had heard and seen. She commented more loudly on Nikolai Fyodorovich's last actions.</p><p>"What good are these crazy ideas? Here good people can only wonder. Why are you starting all this bother in your old age? He won't use his wheelchair, his old legs bother him, and he's forcing his weak legs to walk. Why can't people be satisfied with their life? It's warm and comfortable in their house, but they're always lacking something. All this is never enough."</p><p>I remembered Galina, worried about Nikolai Fyodorovich's health, asking me to caution him, only now I didn't understand what from, so I asked, "What have you come up with, Nikolai Fyodorovich?"</p><p>Though excited, he spoke firmly, "I have a big request for you, Vladimir. I just ask you to have some respect for an old man."</p><p>"Tell me, and if I can, I'll carry out your request."</p><p>"I heard you were planning to assemble people wishing to start construction of an ecological settlement. You want to petition the authorities for them each to have a hectare of land to set up a homestead."</p><p>"Yes, I am. The foundation has already written applications and submitted them to administrations in several provinces. But the issue of allocating land has not yet been decided. They're giving out small allotments, for a few families, but there have to be at least 150 at once, otherwise you can't build infrastructure."</p><p>"They will allocate the land, Vladimir. Without fail."</p><p>"That would be good. But what is your request?"</p><p>"When they start allotting land for homesteads—and they definitely will in every region of Russia—I beg of you, Vladimir, not to refuse an old man. Accept me, as well, into this community of people. I, too, want to set up my own piece of homeland before I die."</p><p>Nikolai Fyodorovich was getting very worked up and began speaking heatedly and quickly.</p><p>"Set it up for myself. For my children and grandchildren. I'm growing this little cedar here in a pot so that I can plant the sapling with my own hands on a piece of my homeland. I won't be a burden to people. I'll set up everything on my hectare myself, lay out an orchard, plant a living fence. I will be able to help my neighbors. I have savings, and fees for various articles keep coming in. My sons . . . No matter what, they never refuse me material assistance. I'll build myself a small house there and finance construction for my neighbors."</p><p>"That's all we need"—Galina spoke up even louder than before. "How can anyone think about planting an orchard when his legs don't even go. He's even planning to help his neighbors. Oh, if only good people could hear! What would good people think? His sons built him such a house. Live and rejoice. Thank your sons and God. The man is set on this. Imagine coming up with an idea like this in his old age. What can good people think about someone like that?"</p><p>Nikolai Fyodorovich heard what Galina said but ignored it or pretended to ignore it and went on.</p><p>"Vladimir, I realize my decision might be viewed as excessively emotional, but that's not true. My decision is the fruit of extensive contemplation. Only outwardly might my life seem beautiful—a home with all the conveniences, practically a palace, a housekeeper, sons of some status in society—but in fact I was dead before I became acquainted with Anastasia. Yes, Vladimir, that's right. Imagine, I've been living here more than four years. I spend my time mainly in my study. And no one needs me. I can have absolutely no influence on anything. The same fate awaits both my sons and my grandsons—the fate of sensing one's own death during one's lifetime.</p><p>"A man is considered dead, Vladimir, when he stops breathing, but that is not so. A man dies as soon as no one needs him and nothing depends on him.</p><p>"The neighbors around my house have simpler little houses, but I have no friends among them. My sons even asked me not to give the neighbors my last name. Many jealous people around wonder whose house—more like a palace—this is. When they find out whose it is, the press will start investigating what funds were used to build it. And you won't be able to prove they were earned by your own hard work. Here I am sitting here as if imprisoned, as if I were already dead, sitting in my study on the second floor, and I don't get up because there's no point. I have had many of my works on philosophical topics published, but after getting to know Anastasia. . . . I will tell you right now, Vladimir, and please don't consider what I've said to be the fruit of an old man's imaginings, I will prove the correctness of the following conclusion. You understand, Vladimir, it is right now, at this very moment, that the Divine judgment is being made."</p><p>"Judgment? But where and how? Why doesn't anyone know about it?"</p><p>"You understand, Vladimir, for a very long time we imagined this judgment as some ominous being coming from on high with his terrifying army. This being would tell each person in what ways each person was righteous and which ways he wasn't. Then he would determine a measure of punishment, sending those judged to hell or heaven. We had imagined the Divine judgment so primitively. But God is not primitive. He cannot judge in that way. He gave man eternal freedom, but any judgment is tantamount to violence against the individual and the deprivation of his freedom."</p><p>"Then why did you say then that the Divine judgment is taking place at the present moment?"</p><p>"I repeat what I said. The Divine judgment is taking place at the present moment. But each person must judge himself. I have understood what Anastasia created. Her philosophy, strength, and logic are accelerating processes. Imagine many believing her, Vladimir, and implementing her idea of beautiful, Divine settlements. Those who have believed will find themselves in a heavenly garden. Others will not believe and remain right where they are now. Everything in the world is relative.</p><p>"For now, it does not seem possible that we might compare our life with another, and we think that our life is bearable. But when a different life is nearby, when those who did not believe come to understand, then they will see themselves in hell. Some consider themselves lucky merely because they don't know just how unlucky they are. It is right now that a Divine judgment is underway that is unusual for our understanding. This is not my discovery alone. A psychologist from Novosibirsk who has done research on the reaction of various groups to Anastasia's statements has said basically the same thing. The psychologist and I are acquainted, and I have read her
 published conclusions, and they are similar to mine.</p><p>"People from various cities sense the grandeur of what is happening. Professor Eryomkin, whose poems have been published in a national anthology, speaks in magnificent verse about the Anastasia phenomenon. I will remind you, Vladimir, of the poems dedicated to Anastasia:</p><p> </p><p>In you I saw Man,</p><p>From the end of another era perhaps,</p><p>Where my grandchildren shall stand,</p><p>Among goddesses, your embodiment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I memorized these beautiful lines. I want my grandchildren to live among goddesses, too, and so I want to provide them with this opportunity and begin to set up a small piece of our beautiful homeland for them. Buying land, and not just one hectare, is not the problem for me, but who will live in the vicinity is of great importance. This is why I want to set up my land among people of like mind. Set it up for my grandchildren. One of them will certainly want to live there. And my sons will want to come to their father's beautiful garden to relax from the hustle and bustle. Right now they visit me very rarely. But they would come to a garden I laid out. I will ask to be buried in this garden. My sons will come.</p><p>"I am speaking about my grandchildren and my sons, but above all it is I who needs to create what is inherent in the human essence, otherwise . . . Understand, Vladimir. . . . Suddenly I wanted to live and act. I will be able to. I will be a foot soldier lined up for Anastasia."</p><p>"You could very well live right here, too. Why not live here nice and quietly?" Galina said.</p><p>This time Nikolai Fyodorovich decided to respond to what she said. He turned and addressed her.</p><p>"I understand your concern, Galina Nikiforovna. You're afraid of losing your job and your roof. Please don't worry. I will help you build a small house nearby, and you will have your own little house and your own land. You'll get married, you'll find your intended."</p><p>Suddenly straightening to her full height, Galina threw down on the magazine table the white rag she had been supposedly dusting that table with during our entire conversation, put her hands on her ample hips, and was about to say something but couldn't. It was as if her indignation had taken the breath from her, and then she gathered her forces and spoke very softly:</p><p>"Maybe I don't want to be a neighbor to a neighbor like that. . . . I can build my own house for myself when I get my land. I used to help my father deal with the felling when I was a girl. And I've tucked away a tidy little sum. But this job here is not to my liking. Who do I keep house for day in and day out on these floors? No one is ever there, and I'm keeping house like a fool. I don't want to be neighbors with slow-witted neighbors."</p><p>Galina suddenly turned sharply and walked quickly to her room. But soon after, the door to her room opened wide. Galina was holding two small pots in which there were green shoots like the one in Nikolai Fyodorovich's handsome pot. She walked over to the window and put her little pots next to it on the windowsill. Then she returned to her room and brought back a large basket filled with many small rag bundles.</p><p>She placed the basket at Nikolai Fyodorovich's feet and said, "These are seeds. They're real because I spent a whole fall and summer collecting them in the forest from all kinds of real healing herbs. The ones they sow in fields to sell in pharmacies don't have the same strength. Scatter them with your own hand on your land; they will multiply your health and strength. Both when they grow and when you drink an infusion of them in winter. But your little cedar is going to be bored alone, it shouldn't be alone, there are its friends and brothers"—Galina pointed to the window where three pots of shoots now stood and walked slowly to the door, tossing out as she went: "Goodbye and good luck, philosophers. You may know the philosophy of death. But you still need to study the philosophy of life."</p><p>It was clear from everything that Galina had been terribly hurt by something, and she was leaving for good. Nikolai Fyodorovich took a step after her and swayed. Because he had taken a step without holding onto anything. He swayed and tried to lean on the back of a chair, but the chair fell. Nikolai Fyodorovich tottered, his arms held out to the sides. I jumped up to support him but was too late. Galina, who had nearly reached the door, quickly turned toward the noise of the falling chair, saw Nikolai Fyodorovich tottering, and was by his side in a flash. She managed to grab the old man, who was already sinking on his buckling legs, with her strong arms and hold him up, pressing him to her ample bosom. Then she let go one hand, got a better grip on Nikolai Fyodorovich's legs, and carried him like a child to the rocking chair, sat him in it, took his lap rug, and began wrapping his legs, murmuring as she did this.</p><p>"Well, looks to me like Anastasia has a pretty fragile soldier here. Not even a soldier, just a recruit."</p><p>Nikolai Fyodorovich put his hand on Galina's and, looking closely at the woman sitting by his feet with downcast eyes, suddenly switched to the familiar "you."</p><p>"Forgive me, Galya. I thought you were laughing at my aspirations, but you . . ."</p><p>"I'm the one laughing? Have I really lost my mind altogether?" Galina began speaking quickly. "Every night I do nothing but think my sincerest thought. How can I plant herbs, real healing herbs, I think, how can I give them to my bright falcon to drink and bring back his strength. I make real cabbage soup from the freshest cabbage that doesn't have the slightest whiff of chemicals. I give you steamed milk, not skim. And when my bright falcon comes to rights, maybe I'll bear him a little baby. I wasn't laughing at all. I just talked like that to see how firm your decision was and whether you would change your mind halfway there."</p><p>"It's firm, Galina, it won't change."</p><p>"Well, if that's so, if that's so, don't drive me out to be your neighbor. Don't predict for me another intended."</p><p>"I wasn't driving you out, Galya. I simply wasn't assuming your consent to be by my side not only in a well-equipped house. I'm pleased at your wish, Galya. Thank you so very much for it. I never thought . . ."</p><p>"What is there not to think here? What woman worth her salt would ever let her eye stray from such a determined soldier? I read and read about Anastasia. . . . Reading it took me a long time, syllable by syllable, but I understood her right away. All us women nowadays would do well to be like Anastasia. So I've decided to be a little bit of an Anastasia for you. All us women should be a little bit like Anastasia. She doesn't have her soldier boys yet, just green recruits. We women will beef them up and marry them."</p><p>"Thank you, Galina. This means that you, Galina Nikiforovna, have read . . . And made sense of in the evenings . . ."</p><p>"Yes, I've read them. I've read all the books about Anastasia and thought about them in the evenings. Only there's no sense calling me by my formal name anymore. I've long been meaning to ask you. I'd rather be Galya."</p><p>"Fine, Galya. You said something very interesting when you were angry, yes very interesting: 'You know the philosophy of death, but you still need to study the philosophy of life.' What a full definition of the two opposite philosophical trends! A very precise definition: the philosophy of death and the philosophy of life. It's stunning! Anastasia is the philosophy of life. Yes! Of course, that's right, stunning!"</p><p>Agitated and tenderly stroking Galina's hand, Nikolai Fyodorovich added admiringly: "You're a philosopher, Galina, and I had no idea."</p><p>Then he said to me, "Undoubtedly, there is still a lot for us to understand both from the philosophical standpoint and with the help of esoteric definitions. I have been trying to evaluate Anastasia as a person, a person such as we all should be. But the full perception of her as a person similar to us is hindered by certain inexplicable abilities of hers.</p><p>"Vladimir, you described an episode when she saved people from torture at a distance. She saved them, but she herself fainted, you will remember, she turned white and the green grass around her turned white. What kind of mechanism is this and why did she herself and the grass around her turn white? I have never encountered the like anywhere, although I've attempted to speak with esoterics. Philosophers, physicists, and esoterics know of no phenomenon like this."</p><p>"How could they not?" Galina, still sitting on the floor at the professor's feet, broke into the conversation. "What is there to think about here when their eyes should be scratched out?"</p><p>"Whose eyes, Galya? You mean you have your own opinion concerning this phenomenon as well?" Nikolai Fyodorovich asked in amazement, turning to Galina.</p><p>She readily answered.</p><p>"It's as clear as God's day. Whenever evil spirits fall upon a person with any foul news or threats or attack him with spite, man turns white. Pale, I mean. He turns pale when he doesn't reflect that spite. He sets it burning inside him. He suffers it, it burns inside him, and he turns white. There's lots of examples of that in life. Anastasia is burning those evil spirits inside her, and the grass gets whiter because it's trying to help. As far as I'm concerned, every kind of evil spirit should have its eyes scratched out."</p><p>"Indeed, truly. Lots of people do turn white," Nikolai Fyodorovich spoke with amazement, looking closely at Galina, and added, "and it is true, after all, that a person turns white when, rather than reflecting unpleasantness, he just tries to suffer through it inside. So he burns it inside him, it turns out. That's true, you see! How simple it all turns out to be. Anastasia is burning the energy of aggression aimed at her inside her. If it's reflected, it doesn't diminish in space, and it affects someone else. Anastasia doesn't want anyone to be
 affected. But a lot is going to be aimed at her—all that has accumulated over the ages, as well as what is being produced now by followers of the philosophy of death. Who has the strength to withstand that kind of onslaught? Who? Hold on, Anastasia! Hold on, great warrior!"</p><p>"And she will hold on. Now we will help her. Since I started giving away her books at the market, the women there who read them have started clustering on the corner. I gave them cedar seeds, too. They planted them. I told them about healing herbs. The women say, "We should do something. Naturally, we aren't going to beat our muzhiks, as one on the corner there suggested, but we have to think about who we want to have children by."</p><p>"How is that, Galina?" Nikolai Fyodorovich was amazed. "You already have your own little party cell?"</p><p>"Oh, no. What cell could it be? We just stand a bit on the corner and we chew the fat about life."</p><p>"But why were you planning to beat men? What kind of arguments were you guided by?"</p><p>"What kind? What good are they? Go on, give them a child, and we give birth. But we don't have a nest for our fledglings, and when you can't make a nest, how can you ask for a child? How can a woman be content with a muzhik when she sees her forsaken child languishing? A teacher's joined us twice already. The teacher says there's some psychological factor that's keeping them from believing in themselves, and she's waiting for a loan from some foundation overseas. It's a syndrome, she says. Lack of faith in yourself. This psychic business comes up with all kinds of reasons for not building a nest.</p><p>"The teacher also told us women that this loan will have to be repaid after some years. Maybe twenty, maybe thirty, I don't remember. Only I do remember that a little more has to be repaid than they gave. So is this how it works out, that the muzhik nowadays has sold his children?"</p><p>"Why that comparison, Galina?"</p><p>"What do you mean 'why'? Muzhiks now have so messed themselves up, all they care about is money. But who will have to repay that money? Children who are teeny tiny right now are going to have to repay that loan, as well as children who aren't even born yet. And a little more, even, then was given—our children are going to have to repay that. We women have started seeing the picture of the future like this and that's why we're so fierce over our children. They wanted to beat up the muzhiks. And I thought we oughtn't expect help from anywhere, it's time for us to help the poor things ourselves.</p><p>"One time I tried some sausage from overseas, and it filled my heart with tears, and I so wanted to send a piece of Ukrainian salt pork to whoever made that sausage and some homemade sausage. Dear God! People in those countries have no idea what sausage should taste like. We can't take a loan from people like that. It will be bad money. It will bring no good, nothing but harm. And I'm telling you, it was just one who suggested we thrash all the muzhiks. The other women didn't agree. Why should they? You could knock the last sense from them that way. And so the women tell each other stories of the bad life the muzhiks have made for them. But I boast, I say mine's already got down to brass tacks. He's getting ready to build a nest."</p><p>"Yours? Who is he?"</p><p>"What do you mean who? I was telling them about you. How you're growing a little cedar and how you asked me to bring you a board with a big ruler. That one over there, on the stand"—Galina pointed to a drafting table by his desk. "I told them how you asked me which trees were best to plant around your hectare, and you made drawings on paper on your desk, you drew a fine settlement where good people would live. You didn't have enough room on your papers, so you asked me to bring bigger sheets and a board and a ruler.</p><p>"When I told the women, we all went together to choose the board. We chose the biggest and best—it was expensive. The women say, 'Don't be stingy, Galina.' They were helping me, but their eyes were envious. Those witches are envious that my child is going to be born in a wonderful garden on his own land and among good people. But I'm not angry at those who envy me behind my back. I wish everyone happiness. They pitched in together to buy me a camera and asked me to take a picture of the drawing. I took the camera, and they explained where to press the button and which window to look through. Only I just couldn't bring myself to ask your permission and I didn't press the button."</p><p>"You did the right thing, Galina, not taking a picture of the plans without permission. When I finish, then maybe I will publish it as one of the options for a future settlement."</p><p>"This way you won't finish soon, and the women aren't going to be able to hold out from peeking at your fine, beautiful future. You drew a beautiful picture on a big piece of paper."</p><p>"Why don't you think I'll finish soon? Everything is nearly ready for publication, both the blueprints and the color drawing.</p><p>"I'm telling you, you drew a beautiful picture. Only you shouldn't publish it so that people can do the same, but you can show it to the women, the women I meet with, and I'll explain that it's not quite right."</p><p>Nikolai Fyodorovich quickly wheeled over to the drafting table, and I joined him. There, several parcels of a future settlement had been drawn schematically in color. In the drawing were the houses, the orchards, the living fence made of various trees, the ponds . . . Basically, everything was laid out wonderfully, handsomely.</p><p>"Where did you see a mistake or imprecision?" Nikolai Fyodorovich asked Galina when she came over.</p><p>"You didn't draw the sun in your picture. But if you draw the Sun, then you need to draw the shadows, too. And when you've drawn the shadow, you'll realize that you shouldn't plant tall trees from the direction of the sunrise because they will block the gardens. They need to be moved to the other side."</p><p>"Yes? Possibly. You might have said something before. So far, though, I've only laid things out schematically. Galina, so you do mean to have a child?"</p><p>"Naturally. You do your exercises for now, and when you stand on your native land, you'll come out of your catacombs. I'll feed you what we grow on our native land and give you healing infusions to drink. And when spring comes, you'll see how everything comes to life and flourishes on its native land. You'll feel your strength. Then I will give birth."</p><p>Galina sat back down on the rug at Nikolai Fyodorovich's feet, placing her palms on the old philosophy professor's hand, which was resting on the armrest. Galina was far from young, but she was sturdy, amply built, and strong, and she even seemed tender and beautiful. Their conversation became more and more good-natured. They seemed to have plunged into a philosophy of life, and I stood there like a fifth wheel in a state of incomprehension, and so I wedged into their conversation.</p><p>"It's time, Nikolai Fyodorovich. I have to go. Otherwise I'll be late for my plane."</p><p>"Oh, I'll quick go get some pies"—Galina stood up—"jam pies for the road, I'll quick go bring them to you."</p><p>Nikolai Fyodorovich slowly rose from his chair, leaning with one hand on his desk and holding out the other in parting. His handshake was no longer an old man's.</p><p>"Give Anastasia my respects, Vladimir, and, please, tell her, the philosophy of life will certainly win out here. My thanks to her."</p><p>"I'll tell her."</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0519>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>19. Who Controls Chance Incidents?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>From the moment the first printing of the book about Anastasia appeared, scientists have written quite a few articles characterizing the "Anastasia phenomenon." Many of them spoke about me as well. As a rule, when I heard or read unflattering reviews about myself, if they did unsettle me, it was not for long—a day or two, a week maximum. I rebel inside for a while and forget it.</p><p>However, during a gathering in Moscow, one reader gave me an audiocassette of a lecture made at a theory and practice conference by the director of a group of scientists researching the Anastasia phenomenon.</p><p>I listened to the audio recording a few days later. After I understood what I had heard, it not only unsettled me, but seemed to destroy me for good—destroyed me to myself, above all. Before listening to the tape, I had planned to go to the taiga to see Anastasia and my son, but after I heard the recording, I decided not to. I will briefly recap the content of the tape.</p><p>"Esteemed colleagues, I am going to present to you a few findings and conclusions made by the group of scientific researchers I head up on the basis of more than three years' research into the phenomenon conventionally called 'Anastasia.'</p><p>"In my report, I will use the name 'Anastasia' not only for shorthand clarification, but also because the phenomenon has itself been presented under this name. At the same time, I am not ruling out the possibility in the future of giving it a more precise and typical scientific definition. Today this is difficult to do, for I am convinced that we have come into contact with something that goes beyond the framework of traditional scientific trends and possibly modern science as a whole. As a preliminary, we defined three aspects of the research: the authenticity of the events set forth in author V. Megre's books, V. Megre's books themselves, and society's reaction to V. Megre's books.</p><p>"Six months later, it was clear that the authenticity or lack thereof of the events set forth in the books is of no importance. The stormy emotional reaction of most readers who come in contact with V. Megre's books comes about regardless of the reality of the events described. Society's reaction is evoked by completely different factors. However, the time, money, and intellectual potential we spent
 nonetheless did lead to one other finding that is in my opinion interesting: the desire of individual people, including sociologists and scientific circles, to cast doubt on Anastasia's existence is in fact essential to the phenomenon.</p><p>"It is the discussion of the 'does she or doesn't she exist' question that has allowed the phenomenon to penetrate unimpeded into every stratum of present-day society. Rejection of Anastasia's existence basically neutralizes the resistance to her intentions. If she does not exist, then, accordingly, there is no subject of research and nothing to resist. However, the reaction in society to Anastasia's statements attests to the necessity of conducting research and determining her significance and intellectual resources.</p><p>"With respect to the authenticity of the events set forth in the books, one can conclude the following:</p><p>"In setting out what happens, the author not only presents himself under his own name, but does not spare those around him during the events described. He does not alter their names or change the place of action or the impartiality of certain situations. Thus, for example, the episode described in the first book, in which V. Megre, in the presence of the ship's captain, flirted during one of his recreational voyages with the village girls who had come to the ship, has been fully confirmed. The ship's crew members confirm the fact of the appearance that same evening of a calm and taciturn young woman wrapped in a scarf. V. Megre showed this woman the ship and then secluded himself with her. From the book, we learn that this was the first appearance of the Siberian hermit Anastasia on V. Megre's flagship, the first meeting between entrepreneur Vladimir Megre and the Siberian hermit Anastasia, their first dialog.</p><p>"Witnesses' testimony and documents confirm the chronology of many events described in the book. Not only that, even more unusual situations are sketched out that were either unintentionally or for unknown reasons left out by V. Megre. Meriting special attention, for instance, is the fact of V. Megre's hospital stay in Novosibirsk. The history of his prolonged illness, diagnoses, and sudden recovery are in his medical record.</p><p>"We have established that his recovery occurred immediately after the doctors used the cedar oil brought to the hospital by an unknown woman.</p><p>"I won't hide the fact that once we were deep into our inquiry as to the authenticity of the events described in the book, and having the opportunity to make use of forensic services, among others, we could have confirmed or refuted a great deal. We were stopped by the fact of the appearance in our society of a stormy and unusual reaction to V. Megre's books, or rather, to the statements by Anastasia set forth in them. The majority did not care about the details of Megre's intimate relations; people were excited by Anastasia's monologues.</p><p>"The very first research into this reaction, and especially its present-day manifestations, reliably shows that the 'something' that calls itself Anastasia is obviously having an impact on present-day society.</p><p>"Its zone of influence continues to spread even at the present time. We must pay even closer attention to the most incredible conclusions and attempt to understand and research them. In all likelihood, the 'Anastasia' phenomenon possesses a force and possibilities that our consciousness and intellect are incapable of fully understanding.</p><p>"In the chapter, 'Across the Dark Forces' Span of Time,' published in V. Megre's very first book, the phenomenon predicts not only the book's appearance, but also how, at what expense, it will take hold of people's minds and consciousness. In her monologue, Anastasia asserts that she has collected from various times the best combinations of sounds in the Universe and that they will have a positive effect on people. She asserts that this is a simple action: 'As you see, this is simply a translation of the combinations of signs from the depths of eternity and the infinity of the Cosmos, precise in meaning, significance, and purpose.'</p><p>"All the members of our group arrived at a single conviction: this statement is a fiction. Our conviction was based on the following logical and, as we believed, indisputable finding. If certain unusual combinations do exist in the book, then they cannot affect those reading it since there is no instrument reproducing them. The book cannot emit sounds, and consequently they cannot bring the 'sounds of the Universe' supposedly collected by Anastasia to our hearing.</p><p>"Later, though, Anastasia gave the following answer: 'Yes, the book does not make sounds, it serves as sheet music. Inside himself, the reader involuntarily pronounces the sounds he reads. And so the combinations hidden in the text sound in the soul in their undistorted, primordial form. They bear both the Truth and healing. An artificial instrument cannot reproduce what is sounded in the soul.'</p><p>"In his third book, 'The Dimension of Love,' V. Megre himself cites this dialogue between Anastasia and scientists. For unknown reasons, however, he gives it in abbreviated form. Or, if you consider that the phenomenon itself participates in the books' appearance, then it is that phenomenon, possibly, that intentionally omits the continuation of Anastasia's response to scientists. Why? Perhaps in order to leave unbelievers in their state of inaction? The fact consists merely in that proofs do exist for Anastasia's incredible statement. I will cite here the continuation of the dialogue between Anastasia and scientists. To the opponent's assertion: the fact of any sounds not inherent in the speech organs converging inside a person has never been recorded anywhere, the following response was heard from Anastasia:</p><p>"'It has been recorded. And I can cite an example.'</p><p>"'But this example has to be known to many people.'</p><p>'"Fine. Ludwig von Beethoven.'</p><p>'"What does this name speak to?'</p><p>"'The "Ode to Joy," as Ludwig von Beethoven's ninth symphony is called. It was written for symphonic orchestra and large chorus.'</p><p>"'Let's say that it's true, but how can this confirm your assertion about the rise of sounds inside a reader? No one hears these sounds.'</p><p>"'The sounds that arise inside the book's reader are heard only by the reader himself.'</p><p>"'There, you see? Only by him. Consequently, there is no proof. And your example with Beethoven's symphony is unconvincing.'</p><p>"'Ludwig von Beethoven, who wrote the "Ode to Joy," his ninth symphony, was deaf," Anastasia replied.</p><p>"Beethoven's biography has confirmed this fact. Not only that, the deaf composer also took the conductor's stand during the first performance of his symphony.</p><p>"After becoming acquainted with this historical fact, Anastasia's following statement no longer raises doubts: 'Each pronounced letter or combination of letters from any text can be transferred into a sound. Any page of text can be compared to a sheet of music. The only question is who will be able to set out the letter-notes and how. Will it amount to a great symphony or audible chaos? And another question: does everyone have a sufficiently perfected instrument capable of reproducing the full orchestration inside himself?'</p><p>"Subsequently, our group's researchers arrived at this conclusion: 'Anastasia's statements regarding the derivatives of the burst, the means of moving with the help of the formation of a vacuum, the cleaning of the air, the agro-technical devices, the significance of cedar oil in healing many illnesses, the energy of the thoughts man produces, and many others merit the closest attention from scientific circles.'</p><p>"In drawing this inference, our group lays no claims to being first with the discovery. Simultaneously, or a slightly before us, it was drawn by Novosibirsk scientists. Attesting to this is the speech by Speransky, director of the Club of Novosibirsk Scientists. In a published work, 'Healthier to Believe,' by Novosibirsk psychologist Zhutikova, the following conclusion was drawn from the sociological research she had conducted.</p><p>"'The attitude toward Anastasia itself does not depend on the presence or absence of higher education and scientific degrees, but rather a great deal on the character of the person, on the hierarchy of his values, on his conscious and unconscious attitudes—i.e., on the person's personality and all its constituent parts. It depends on whether the person wants Anastasia to be a reality. It depends on how open the person's consciousness is and how prepared it is to accept something astounding that goes beyond the conventional framework. That which is revealed to us (and how it is revealed) depends on the specifics of our era and corresponds to the level of our self-awareness.'</p><p>"The research by Novosibirsk scientists may have advanced significantly ahead of ours, but the Siberian branch of the Academy of Sciences did not finance it. Our group, having received a contract and, consequently, certain financial resources, already today is capable of stating conclusively with confidence the following fact: our civilization has come in contact with a phenomenon that has not been subjected to research before and, as a consequence, has no scientific definition as of the present day. Research must be done that brings in both modern scientific approaches and, above all, physicists and psychologists, but also esoterics. The processes taking place today in our society under the influence of the "Anastasia" phenomenon are obvious and real, and we cannot, we do not have the right, to ignore them.</p><p>"Some of the events described in V. Megre's books at first glance look like a fiction, and we have attempted to cast doubt on them. Meanwhile, subsequent events that happened to the author and that are not cited in the books are more incredible. But the incredible does happen. And it is up to us to draw conclusions that are
 hard for us to believe ourselves.</p><p>"One such conclusion is that Vladimir Megre does not exist. It is pointless to study his biography to clarify what is happening.</p><p>"At first glance, the incredible conclusion in fact removes and clarifies a number of incredible things, specifically, how an ordinary Siberian entrepreneur could suddenly write a book (more than one now), and how these books could become some of the most popular in Russia. Upon closer examination, the explanations advanced in the press become flimsy: 'The ruined entrepreneur decided to set his affairs to rights at the expense of literary creation.' But we have a lot of ruined entrepreneurs. Not one of them has become a famous writer.</p><p>"'He was able to come up with a sensational topic'—but the topic is irrelevant here. Every week esoteric publications do nothing but publish sensational articles about unusual phenomena—super healers, flying saucers, extraterrestrials—and society barely reacts to them. But after all, professional journalists and writers are preparing these articles.</p><p>"'Megre's books have been heavily promoted.' Quite the contrary, many publications now are attempting to promote themselves at the expense of V. Megre's books. We have established for a certainty that the first books really did sell by bypassing even bookstores. All three books by V. Megre were published not through a publishing house with a solid distribution network, but by Moscow Printing Press No. 11, which is not engaged in the book trade at all. Yet lines formed for Megre's books, and the wholesalers invested their money before the books' appearance.</p><p>"In the opinion of many booksellers, Megre's books were distributed in spite of the generally recognized canons of the book business and shattered specialists' notions about current consumer demand.</p><p>"So what does this imply? Suddenly, out of nowhere, Vladimir Megre became a genius? Not suddenly. I repeat, Vladimir Megre, the entrepreneur who was well known in Siberia, simply does not exist today. Proof for this conclusion can be seen back in the first book by a close reading of Anastasia's statements. Let us recall her words addressed to Vladimir:</p><p>"'You will write the book guided exclusively by your feelings and soul. Otherwise you won't be able to, because you don't have the writing technique. But with feelings you can do everything. These feelings are already inside you. Both mine and yours.'</p><p>"Take note of Anastasia's last words: 'These feelings are already inside you. Both mine and yours.' Consequently, added to Vladimir Megre's perceptional worldview is Anastasia's perceptional worldview. We are not going to consider how or at what expense the addition was achieved. We will accept it as a fact, from which this logical conclusion follows: if to one relative value another is added, then a third independent value is born of the merging of these two values.</p><p>"In this way, the present-day Megre's date of birth cannot be calculated by the date indicated on his official birth certificate. A better basis would be 1994, when V. Megre and Anastasia met.</p><p>"The new individual, outwardly corresponding to the former Megre's appearance, nonetheless could not maintain the striking distinctions to which literary ability pertains or the ability to hold an audience's attention for an extended period of time—five hours and more—as has been recorded twice by witnesses during his speech to a readers conference in Gelendzhik in Krasnodar District. This fact has been confirmed as well in several major periodicals.</p><p>"Based on the description in the book alone, many analysts and journalists, carried away by comparisons of and research into events connected with Vladimir Megre's activities, are trying at a subconscious or even openly aggressive level to conclude, 'This is impossible.'</p><p>"Esteemed colleagues, I am inclined to believe, and not without grounds, just as you can be convinced from subsequent reports, that this assertion is nothing but a defensive mechanism of the organism for those whose consciousness and intellect cannot comprehend the essence of what is going on.</p><p>"Vladimir Megre himself, or to put it more accurately, a part of his own 'I,' is to an even greater extent incapable of comprehending what is happening to him. He has simply grown used to it gradually, beginning to regard the most incredible as ordinary or logical, which has also spared him from a psychological breakdown. I think that he, like many readers, has failed to ascribe any special significance to what Anastasia said at her first meeting with him in the taiga. When Vladimir Megre objected, 'I am not even going to try to write anything,' Anastasia replied, 'Yes, you will. They have clearly composed an entire system of circumstances that will compel you to do it.'</p><p>"This dialog is quoted in the first book, but in Megre's subsequent books there is not even an attempt to return to the question of who these enigmatic 'They' are. After obtaining certain information, associates of our group studied more closely the dialogs quoted in the first book and picked out the references Anastasia made to 'They' scattered through its pages. I will cite for you these mentions in Anastasia's words:</p><p>"'If it hadn't been for Them, and a little for me, your second expedition would have been impossible.'</p><p>"'I want you to be cleansed. That is why I came up with the idea then of a pilgrimage to holy places and the book you will write. They have approved it, but the dark forces are always struggling with them, but they never win on the main thing.'</p><p>"'My plan and awareness were precise and real, and They approved them.'</p><p>"'They are subordinate only to God.'</p><p>"From Anastasia's statements, one can conclude that vague forces are going to compose for Megre a system of life circumstances that force him to commit actions preprogrammed by someone. If this is the case, then the role of Megre as an individual in his creations is reduced to nil or, at least, is highly insignificant. It is all simply offered to him on a platter through a system of supposedly random life circumstances. In this way, blatant violence has been committed against the Megre's old self.</p><p>"We have decided that if we are able to establish certain anomalies in Megre's behavior or, more precisely, the presence of a system of circumstances, so-called random occurrences, then their presence can confirm or refute the reality of what happened in the taiga, the degree of participation of Megre as an individual in the social movements connected with the publication of his books, and the authenticity of the existence of certain forces capable of shaping chance occurrences that influence man's fate.</p><p>"We have been able to ascertain in greatest detail Megre's behavior on Cyprus in June 1999, when he was working on his fourth book, 'Co-Creation,' or, even more precisely, when he comprehended Anastasia's monologues about the creation of the Earth and man that he had already recorded. What we discovered in Cyprus can be characterized by one brief phrase: 'What is this?' I will acquaint you with certain events.</p><p>"In late May 1999, Vladimir Megre took a Transavia flight to Cyprus. He was not part of a tour group. He did not know anyone on Cyprus. He could not communicate in any foreign language spoken on Cyprus. The receiving party, the Leptos firm, lodged the lone tourist from Russia in a single room on the second floor of a small hotel. From the room's balcony, there was a view of a large pool around which tourists, mainly from Germany and England, relaxed and enjoyed themselves. The Russian firm that had sent Vladimir Megre informed the Leptos manager that Megre was a Russian writer. However, for a large tourist company on Cyprus such as Leptos, which is used to receiving world-famous celebrities, this information meant exactly nothing. For them, Megre was an ordinary tourist. However, on the second day of his stay, the company's main manager in charge of the Russian tourist market offered to show him the town and the residential areas built by their firm. The firm's Russian interpreter took part in the trips. I will now familiarize you, esteemed colleagues, with part of the interview given by Leptos interpreter Marina Pavlova.</p><p>"'I accompanied Nikos, the Leptos manager, and Megre. I interpreted their conversations. Megre differed from many Russian tourists who come to Cyprus because of his unwillingness to compromise, which bordered on tactlessness. For instance, we're standing on a hill. Before is a beautiful view of the sea and Pafos.</p><p>"'Nikos is saying the standard thing: "Look at how beautiful the nature around us is. What a magnificent view."</p><p>"'I interpret the sentence, and in reply Megre says, "It's an oppressive view. It's warm. . . . The sea. . . . But the vegetation is quite stunted, just sparse bushes. This is unnatural for a climate like this."</p><p>"'Nikos began to explain: "There used to be solid cedar forests here, but when the Romans captured the island, they built their ships here and chopped down the forest. Not only that, but it rains very rarely on the island."</p><p>"'Megre says again, "The Romans were here many centuries ago, and in that time a new forest could have grown up, but you aren't planting one."</p><p>"'Nikos attempts to explain that it rains very rarely on the island, and even drinking water has to be collected in special reservoirs.</p><p>"'But Megre replies curtly, "There isn't any water because there isn't any forest, and the wind carries the clouds across. If there were a forest, the forest would slow the movement of the lower air streams and, consequently, the movement of the clouds above that. It would rain more often on the island, but I think people haven't planted a forest here because they're trying to sell all the land for construction."</p><p>"'Having said this, he turned away and fell into thoughtful silence, and we were silent as well. It was
 an oppressive pause. There was nothing to say.</p><p>"'The next day, when we were eating at a café, when Nikos asked how he could make Vladimir's vacation better, Megre replied seriously, "People should speak more Russian on the island. The restaurants should serve good fish, not some carp. The room should be quiet. There should be forest nearby, and I don't need the fake smiles."</p><p>"'Then Megre had a meeting with the head of Leptos. How it came about, I have no idea. The head of the firm never met with tourists, and not even all the firm's employees know him by sight. I was present at the meeting as interpreter. But at this meeting, too, Megre said that the firm should change its plan for the residential parcels under construction. Each should be at least a hectare where people could plant trees and look after them, and then the entire island would be transformed. If they don't do that, the island will become unattractive to visitors in the near future and Leptos might not have any commercial prospects.</p><p>"'The firm's head was silent for a while and began talking with some aplomb about the island's legendary attraction and the main one: the pool of the goddess Aphrodite. In the end, he proposed that Megre express his request for improving the comfort of his stay. Leptos's head might have satisfied the desires of many Western millionaires, but what Megre told him was unexpected and seemed more a mockery or a joke. Without smiling, Megre said, "I need to meet with Aphrodite's granddaughter.'</p><p>"'I tried to interpret this as a joke, but no one was laughing, and everyone was so surprised, they were silent for a while.</p><p>"'As it turned out, the news of the Russian tourists oddities reached the employees of the hotel where Megre was staying, and they started laughing at him. In a conversation with me, Nikos said that elements of abnormality were obvious in Megre's behavior.</p><p>"'Every morning, Nikos and I would come to the hotel on official business, and each time Nikos would ask the receptionist with a smile whether Aphrodite's granddaughter was staying at the hotel. Laughing, the receptionist would answer that she wasn't yet but a room was always ready for her.</p><p>"'Megre must have felt the employees' mocking looks when he came down to the bar in the evening or for breakfast in the morning, and I think he found it unpleasant. As a Russian, I also found it unpleasant to see my fellow countryman being mocked, but there was nothing to be done for it.</p><p>"'On the morning of the last day of Megre's stay on Cyprus, Nikos and I went by the hotel as always. Nikos wanted to say goodbye to Megre. As always, he immediately walked up to the receptionist with his now traditional joke, but the receptionist gave Nikos a nontraditional answer. Rather agitated, the reception informed Nikos that Megre had not spent the night in his room and was not in the hotel now. The receptionist went on to add seriously, without a smile or hint at a joke, that the night before, Aphrodite's granddaughter had driven up to the hotel and picked up Megre and his things. She told the receptionist in Greek that they shouldn't worry, the room was at their disposal since Megre would not be coming back to the hotel, he had not reserved a seat for a return flight, and they should tell Nikos that she would bring Megre back by ten in the morning so that he could say goodbye. The receptionist repeated that Aphrodite's granddaughter had spoken to the hotel employees in Greek but to Megre in Russian. Understanding nothing, Nikos and I sat down in armchairs in the hotel lobby and started waiting for ten o'clock in silence.</p><p>"'At exactly ten, the hotel's glass doors opened wide, and we saw Vladimir Megre and a beautiful young woman next to him. I had seen her before. She was the Russian Elena Fadeyeva, and she lived and worked on Cyprus as the representative of a Moscow tourist firm. I said I recognized her, but that did not happen right away. That morning Elena Fadeyeva was unusually beautiful. She was wearing a light long dress, her hair was beautifully done, and her eyes sparkled with happiness. The hotel employees in the lobby immediately noticed the slender young woman walking alongside Megre. The bartenders, maids, and receptionist froze, staring at the people walking toward us. From our conversation with them, Nikos and I learned that Megre had decided to remain on Cyprus another month. When Megre stepped away to the bar for something, to Nikos's comment that Megre was very fastidious and neither he nor the head of Leptos had been able to meet his demands, Elena replied,</p><p>"'"I have carried out all his wishes. I think I will be able to carry out others as well, should they arise."</p><p>"'Nikos kept trying to elicit answers from Elena as to how she could carry out the impossible in just twelve hours. How could Megre's favorite fish from Siberian rivers appear on Cyprus? How could cedars grow up on Cyprus in twelve hours? And how could Cypriots suddenly start to understand the Russian-speaking Megre? Where could she put him up so that no one disturbed his solitude when he wanted that?</p><p>"'Elena replied that she happened to have everything Megre needed. She had settled Vladimir in her own house, which happened to be empty at the moment, not far from Pafos, on the edge of the village of Peyia, and no one could disturb him there. She had provided transport by renting a motor scooter especially for him. Her friend Alla, who was also from Russia and worked on Cyprus, also happened to have the freshwater fish from Siberia. Cedars grow on the hill near her house, and Megre had brought two little Siberian cedars with him, and she had put them in pots right at the front door. There would not be a language barrier for Megre now either since there were telephones in every institution, store, and café and she always had her cell phone turned on and, if necessary, she could interpret anything Megre might want to tell anyone.</p><p>"'When Elena and Vladimir were already walking toward the door under the steady gazes of those present, I reminded Nikos that he had forgotten to ask how Elena could grant Megre's request regarding Aphrodite's granddaughter. Nikos looked at me in amazement and replied, "If this Russian woman is not the living embodiment of Aphrodite or her granddaughter, then the spirit of Aphrodite is definitely present in her now."'</p><p>"Esteemed colleagues, after we learned of these incidents events from Vladimir Megre's stay on Cyprus, a question arose of its own accord: Is the chain of chance incidents that immediately met all Megre's previously expressed demands itself coincidental or is someone—Anastasia or the enigmatic "They" whom Anastasia mentions—shaping these chance incidents? Note, as soon as the people around Megre during his stay at the hotel were amazed at what had happened, a situation took shape in which Megre was removed from the field of vision of those who had been watching him. He moved to Elena Fadeyeva's house. This put an end to the unusual chain of chance incidents for the people around him. But we wondered whether it had in fact come to an end, and we restored further events in as much detail as possible and did so with the help of what was related both by people who knew Elena Fadeyeva and by Elena Fadeyeva herself directly. And what did we find? Not only did the chain of unusual chance incidents turn out not to come to an end, it became even more puzzling. I will cite only separate fragments.</p><p>"So Vladimir Megre is living in solitude in Elena Fadeyeva's small cozy house. More than likely he is making sense of Anastasia's statements about God, the creation of the Earth and man, and man's purpose. It is this part of the book that he wrote then. But he himself did not understand everything. Due to his native caution, before publishing a book, he wants to find somewhere, or in something, at least some confirmation of Anastasia's unusual statements. From time to time, he calls Elena and asks her to come over and take him somewhere in her car. Each time, the young woman immediately carries out Megre's request. She does so even if she has to set aside her own affairs—even to the point of meeting people arriving from Russia. There were two instances when he delegated his affairs to acquaintances, thereby losing out on his own income.</p><p>"Where does Megre go? We established that, apart from the usual spots for tourists to Cyprus, he visited two churches where no traveler had ever been, one might say: a monastery not visited by tourists and a vacant castle in the Troodos Mountains. Several times he climbed a mountain ridge not far from Fadeyeva's house. He walked alone amid the cedars that grew there. Elena waited for him by the road. We also established that all of Megre's trips to churches and monasteries were not planned but spontaneous in nature. Even so, they were part of the same chain of all those chance incidents. Here is how Elena Fadeyeva talks about Vladimir Megre's nighttime visit to a church.</p><p>"'I drove to Vladimir's at about nine o'clock in the evening, right after his call. He said he just wanted to take a ride through town. He got into my car and we started for Pafos. That evening Vladimir was pensive and barely spoke at all. We had been driving for about an hour. When we had driven by a number of cafés on the embankment, I suggested to Vladimir that we have dinner, but he refused. When asked where he'd like to go, he replied, 'I'd like to go to some empty church right now.'</p><p>"'I turned the car around and for some reason drove at high speed to a tiny village. I knew there was a little-visited church there. We drove right up to the entrance and got out of the car. Not a soul around, only the sound of the sea broke the night's silence. We walked up to the front door of the church. In the darkness, below the handle, I felt a large key jutting out of the door. I turned it and
 opened the door to the sanctuary. Vladimir walked in and stood in the middle under the cupola for a long time. I stayed by the door. Then Vladimir walked through the gap where the priests come out and must have lit something there. Something began shining brightly, and the sanctuary began to glow. I stood there a little while and went out to the car. After a while, Vladimir appeared and we left.'</p><p>"Here is the second incident Elena Fadeyeva related.</p><p>"'I wanted to show Vladimir a remote little village so he could see the local daily life. There were lots of different turns off the mountain road we were taking, and I probably made a wrong turn somewhere, because we did not end up at the village and the car was soon directly in front of the gates of a small monastery. Vladimir immediately wanted to go in and asked me to follow him to interpret when he spoke with the monks, but I said I couldn't enter. I was wearing a short skirt and my head was bare, and you can't go into a church or monastery like that. I stayed by the entrance. I watched Vladimir walk through the monastery's courtyard. A young monk appeared before him. They stopped in front of each other and began to talk. Then they walked over to me. I heard the monk speaking Russian to Vladimir, and then an elderly gray-haired man, the monastery's abbot, came out to Vladimir, and they set on a bench for a long time talking about something. The monks and I stood at a distance from them, and we couldn't hear what they were talking about. Then the abbot and monks went to see us off. At the exit from the monastery, Vladimir stopped and so did everyone else. Vladimir turned and walked through the monastery's courtyard toward the sanctuary. No one went after him. We all waited by the entrance for him to come out of the monastery's empty sanctuary.'</p><p>"And so the chain of chance incidents continues. Let me remind you. Vladimir Megre is making sense of what Anastasia said about God. And by chance, at that very moment when he wants to visit an empty church, Elena Fadeyeva, who knows about such a church, chances to turn up? Was it by chance that the key happened to be jutting out of the empty church's door? Was it by chance that Elena turned off the road and brought Megre to a little-visited monastery? Was it by chance that a Russian-speaking monk came out to meet him? We are dealing with a chain of events, life situations, chance incidents logically arranged in practice but leading to some indeterminate goal.</p><p>"Can we, after we have learned of these, speak about the coincidence of the philosophical conclusions drawn in Megre's books? In more than one of the sanctuaries where, as we now know, Megre stood alone under the cupola, the words of God later cited in the fourth book, 'Co-Creation,' were confirmed.</p><p>"We made many attempts, over and over, to track down the details the logic of the chance incidents that occurred to Megre. Among many others, we were interested in the so-called chance meeting between Vladimir Megre and Elena Fadeyeva. We aren't even going to try to guess whether the spirit of Aphrodite had taken up residence in this young woman. Let the esoterics ponder such notions. But do let us think about why this young woman abandoned her own affairs and at his first call ran to Megre, made him borscht, and drove him around Cyprus in her car. Why she suddenly changed so drastically even outwardly after she had met Megre. Why, all of a sudden, as people who know her assert, after her meeting with Megre did Elena's eyes suddenly start to shine? Because she had met a celebrity? But Elena works as the representative of the Moscow Stage tourist firm, and she has had occasion to deal with bigger celebrities than Vladimir Megre. Money? But Megre could not have had a lot of money. Otherwise he would have stayed in a three-star hotel from the beginning. Only one conclusion suggests itself: Elena Fadeyeva fell in love with Megre. And this is confirmed by one thing she told an acquaintance. When asked, "Elena, you haven't fallen in love with this Megre, have you?" she replied, "I don't know. It's such an unfamiliar feeling. . . . But if he wanted. . . ." And so, yet another incredible chance incident occurred. A twenty-three-year-old woman, slender, attractive, independent, and pragmatic, who was not without the attention of many men, suddenly, at first glance, falls in love with a forty-nine-year-old man. You will agree that chance incidents like these are very rare.</p><p>"We tried to analyze, down to the minute, the moment Vladimir Megre and Elena Fadeyeva met. We talked with employees at the Maria Café, who were there when it happened. We reconstructed the day they met from what Elena herself and her acquaintances said. As a result, we have uncovered one more chance incident, but what a chance incident! Thanks to it, Elena was able to start loving Megre a few minutes before she saw him—an incident capable of acting simultaneously on a person's consciousness and subconscious both.</p><p>Imagine Elena Fadeyeva driving behind the wheel of her car through the resort town to the Maria Café. A waitress she knows from the café called her and asked her if she could stop by the café because there was a Russian sitting at a table there and he was nervous. The café sign had a Russian name and Russian dishes, which promised a Russian-speaking waiter, but there wasn't one. Elena first refuses, but soon she happens to have a short break in her work. She gets behind the wheel of her car and rushes to the café where some Russian is sitting at a table. She powders her sunburned nose as she goes, picks up a cassette at random, and puts it in the car's tape player. The acoustic system fills the car with the melody and lyrics of a song popular in Russia. I will now quote these lyrics, and you, esteemed colleagues, can draw your own conclusion. Here are the words that came through Elena's car speakers a few minutes before she met Megre at his café table.</p><p> </p><p>I am a rather young god,</p><p>And I may not have experience,</p><p>But, my little girl, I could help you</p><p>And shed sun-filled light on your life.</p><p> </p><p>You don't have a minute,</p><p>Hardly any break from work,</p><p>But you'll powder your nose, go to dinner,</p><p>And at a café table—meet him.</p><p> </p><p>Trains fly somewhere far away,</p><p>Planes go off the rails,</p><p>If he leaves, it's forever,</p><p>So just don't let him go.</p><p> </p><p>Why are you suddenly silent?</p><p>Look into his eyes, don't be shy:</p><p>I have been closing this circle for so many long years,</p><p>It is I who brought him to meet you.</p><p> </p><p>"And she, or someone through her, did not let him leave. And she, or someone through her, carried out all his wishes and presented more and more new information confirming his philosophical conclusions. He returned to Russia and submitted to the publisher the manuscript of his fourth book, 'Co-Creation.'</p><p>"In this way, V. Megre's life really did resemble the life of Ivan the Fool from the Russian folk tales, the only difference being that the events that occurred to Megre were absolutely real.</p><p>"Having come up against the authenticity of this phenomenon's existence, we cannot fail to assume the existence of certain forces capable of purposefully influencing the fate of an individual person. Questions arise as to whether the possibilities of these forces allow them to influence the fate of all humanity. What was the activity of these forces in the past, or were they activated specifically in our age? What kind of forces are they? The events occurring compel us to be more attentive to Anastasia's statements.</p><p>"Esteemed colleagues, most of the members of our research group are inclined toward the following interpretation: the Siberian hermit Anastasia, while leaving the governments of the different countries in their posts for now, is in fact taking on control of the entire human community. Pay attention: she is not seizing power but is taking on control.</p><p>"Most readers, when they come in contact with V. Megre's books, find a desire to change their way of life. There are already more than a million readers, and their number is growing steadily. When they reach a critical mass, they can influence the decisions of power structures. Even now in power structures, though, there are those who support the books' conclusions.</p><p>"In this way, our society will become just as controllable as V. Megre himself did. I hope that you, esteemed colleagues, now have no doubts that V. Megre is a substance fully under the control of certain forces. I believe we must make a joint effort to sort out who this Siberian hermit Anastasia is. Where, in fact, is she? What are her resources? What forces are helping her? Where is she trying to lead our society? Modern science must answer these questions."</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0520>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>20. Your Desires</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>It was nearly midnight when Anastasia and I reached my apartment. Putting the key into the lock, I felt how terribly tired I was after this event-packed day. Seeing the bed, I told Anastasia that I was terribly tired and went straight to take a shower. When I came out, Anastasia told me, "I made your bed, and I'll lie down on the balcony."</p><p>"It must be stuffy for her in a prefab apartment building," I thought, and I went to see how she had made herself a place to sleep on the balcony. She had spread a runner on the balcony floor and on it the white paper the owners had prepared for wallpapering the walls. Instead of a pillow she had rolled up her top and placed a small branch at the head.</p><p>"How can you get any sleep here? It's going to be harsh and cold. Anastasia, at least take a blanket."</p><p>"Don't worry, Vladimir. This is fine. The air is fresh and I can see the stars. What a starry sky tonight. Look! There's a gentle, warm breeze—I won't freeze. You go to bed, Vladimir. I'll sit at the edge of your bed
 for a little while, and when you fall asleep, I'll go to bed, too."</p><p>I lay down on the bed Anastasia had made up and thought I'd fall right to sleep from exhaustion, but that was not to be. The thought or awareness that all of us are simply toys in the hands of chance was burning me up inside and would not let me rest. Then my irritation began to mount at those who set up these chance incidents, and at Anastasia, too, because I felt she, too, might well be implicated in the shaping of these chance events, at least in my life.</p><p>"Is something bothering you, Vladimir?" Anastasia asked quietly, and I even half-rose up.</p><p>"You're still asking? I believed you. . . . I wanted to believe . . . especially that man, each man, is capable of building a happy life for himself. I especially believed in the eco-villages, where people would live comfortably off their native land. Raising their children to be happy. The schools there would be good ones for children. I believed you that each person is God's beloved child. 'Man is the acme of creation'—didn't you say that? Didn't you?"</p><p>"Yes, Vladimir, I did."</p><p>"Certainly you did. And how convincingly you proved it all to me. I didn't just believe you, but I began to act, to organize a settlement. Papers have already gone to various agencies. The Foundation is collecting applications from people. A plan has been ordered for the orchards and all the different plantings. It would be bad enough if I just believed you, but I began to act with joy. You knew! You knew I would act!"</p><p>"Yes, Vladimir, I did. You're an entrepreneur. You're always prepared to take real actions, to make things real."</p><p>"Always prepared? How simple it all is. Of course. You don't have to be a seer here. Any entrepreneur, if he believes in something, will start to act as, fool that I am, I did."</p><p>I couldn't lie around any longer. I jumped out of bed, went to the window, and opened the hinged pane, because the room felt hot.</p><p>"Why do you consider your actions foolish, Vladimir?" Anastasia asked calmly.</p><p>Her calmness and what I thought was pretence made me even angrier.</p><p>"How can you talk so calmly here? Calmly! As if you didn't know that man is in fact a tiny cog in others' hands. Man is easily controlled through all kinds of circumstances. If they want, they can plunge half of humanity into war and watch the carnage from somewhere up above or on the sidelines. If they want, they can slip in some religion and again watch as people of different religions wage war for their faith. If they want, they can toy with a single person. I'm convinced of this, thanks to people capable of analyzing what is happening, intelligent people."</p><p>"How did these intelligent people manage to convince you that man is merely a toy in the hands of certain forces?"</p><p>"I heard this report. It was talking about me. Intelligent people took an interest in what was happening in society because of my books. They were interested in you and me. They investigated every day of my stay on Cyprus, when I was writing the fourth book. They recorded everything and then analyzed it. Imagine, I'm not offended at them for their investigation. I'm even grateful that they opened my eyes at last. They showed me how man can be toyed with. There are no chance incidents. They're set up. My own experiment has convinced me of this."</p><p>"What experiment? Have you been conducting experiments, Vladimir?"</p><p>"I haven't, but they've conducted experiments on me. When I was on Cyprus, I mentioned a freshwater fish—and the fish appeared. I talked about cedars—and cedars appeared. I wanted to go to a church one night—and a church appeared, whose doors opened at night. A lot more came to pass, and all I had to do was write it down, probably. But the main thing is that Aphrodite's granddaughter appeared. I told a few people on Cyprus that I wanted to meet the granddaughter because I was tired of hearing about their Aphrodite. There are posters hung everywhere about her bath house, and they speak of her arrogantly. Basically, I told them I was going to meet Aphrodite's granddaughter. I said it, and a few days later a young woman with flashing eyes appeared. Basically, circumstances came together, and everyone decided that Aphrodite sent her granddaughter. Miracles happened through this young woman, and she herself was transformed. But who set up these circumstances one after the other? Who? I didn’t set up anything. If only one thing had happened by chance! But here everything was purposeful, not chance at all. That's what the scientists concluded, and I'm convinced that their conclusion is correct. You can't deny it now."</p><p>"I don't intend to deny the purpose in what happens, Vladimir," Anastasia noted calmly.</p><p>At her words, everything turned cold inside me, and instantly an unprecedented apathy poured over me. I hoped—dimly, but nevertheless hoped—that she would be able to allay the awareness that had taken hold inside me, my conviction as to the complete insignificance of all humanity, but she didn't do that. Anyway, who could deny something so obvious? Indifferent to everything, I stood by the window in the room lit only by the moon and looked at the stars.</p><p>Somewhere there, on one of those stars, those running us, toying with us, might live. They do live! How can you call our existence life? A toy obedient to someone's will cannot live independently, and that means we aren't living. We say we don't care to so much."</p><p>Anastasia began again in a quiet and calm voice. But her voice did not rouse any emotions in me whatsoever. It fell on me like some insignificant sound.</p><p>"Vladimir, you and the people who sent you the cassette with the report were right in determining that there really are energies capable, by varying time, to join diverse events into a single chain, or, as happened with you, to set up the chain of circumstances essential for achieving a specific goal. There are no purely chance incidents; this is clear to many by now. Chance incidents, even the seemingly most incredible, are programmed. Everything that happens to every person is programmed. What happened to you on Cyprus was a blatant example for researchers and for you, , naturally, and was also programmed and then brought to pass. Tell me, Vladimir, wouldn't you like to know where the programmer of your immediate chance incidents is right now?"</p><p>"What difference is it where the programmer is? I don't care. On Mars, the Moon . . . I don't care."</p><p>"The programmer is in this room, Vladimir."</p><p>"You mean, it's you? If that's so, nothing changes. I'm not even surprised or angry. I don't care. We're being controlled: that is the tragic despair of all people."</p><p>"I am definitely not the main programmer of your chance incidents, Vladimir. I can have only the slightest influence."</p><p>"Then who? There are only the two of us. Or is there some third, invisible programmer?"</p><p>"Vladimir, this programmer is inside you. It is your desires."</p><p>"How's that?"</p><p>"Only man's desires and aspirations can activate a given program of actions. Such is the law of the Creator. No one ever, no universal force, can violate this law. For man is the master of all universal energies! Man!"</p><p>"But I didn't activate anything on Cyprus, Anastasia. It all happened on its own, by chance, without me."</p><p>"Insignificant things that are nonetheless components of what is more substantive and or leading to the realization of the main goal happened without you, but your desires preceded the main event. Wasn't it you who expressed a desire to meet Aphrodite's granddaughter? You even expressed your desire in front of witnesses and repeated it more than once."</p><p>"Yes, I did."</p><p>"If you remember that, then how can you call the servants carrying out the master's will, the rulers, and the master a toy in their hands?"</p><p>"Yes, that would be foolish. Interesting how that comes out, in general. My goodness.... Desires . . . Why then aren't all desires carried out? Many have all kinds of wishes, but they aren't carried out."</p><p>"A lot depends on the importance of the goal, on the desire's alignment with the light or the dark, on the strength of the desire. The more substantial and lighter the goal, the more the forces of light will be brought in to achieve it."</p><p>"But if the goal is dark—for instance, to get drunk, to fight, to start a war?"</p><p>"Then the dark forces get busy. By his desire, man gives them an opportunity to act. But, as you see, the primary and main factor here is man's desire in either case—your desire, Vladimir."</p><p>I started thinking over what Anastasia had said, and I began feeling better and better. Very pleasant moonlight filled the entire room, and the stars in the sky seemed to shine with a warm rather than a cold light. Anastasia sitting on the edge of the bed seemed to look better.</p><p>"You know, Anastasia, there, on Cyprus, if I'm going to be honest, I nearly started to stray at first. Because I didn't like anything at first. No one spoke Russian. They wouldn't let me work. People all around were partying. I thought, why did I travel here? So I could meet prostitutes? There are lots of women there of, well, easy virtue, from Russia and from Bulgaria."</p><p>"There, you see, Vladimir? You wanted it and there they were. You got drunk on vodka and you agreed to meet with them. A woman from Bulgaria and one from Russia. Only before that you'd wanted to meet Aphrodite's granddaughter, and your first desire was stronger, so she appeared and protected you from everything ruinous. She helped you."</p><p>"Yes, she did. How did you know about the Bulgarian?"</p><p>"From my own worries, Vladimir."</p><p>"I don't understand, but that doesn't matter. Why don't you tell me about that young woman, Elena Fadeyeva? She's not Aphrodite's granddaughter. She's a Russian who just works on Cyprus for a tourist company. But I was talking about Aphrodite's granddaughter. Does that mean the forces of light were too weak to show me Aphrodite's real
 granddaughter?"</p><p>"Not weak at all. They did show her. Aphrodite is now energy. She is capable of joining anyone's energy for a while, if the appropriate meaning of it is foreseen. When Elena Fadeyeva was next to you, she possessed two energies. She could do a great deal during that time. She was able to do a lot and was able to help you."</p><p>"Yes. My thanks to her. And my thanks to Aphrodite."</p><p>All my anxieties and the unpleasant feelings I'd had melted away when I believed that all people were mere toys in the hands of certain forces. Now, after my conversation with Anastasia, confidence and tranquility ensued.</p><p>For a while, I looked silently at Anastasia sitting on the edge of the bed in the moonlight, her hands resting modestly in her lap. Then—to this day I can't understand how this happened—I suddenly said, "I realize who you are, Anastasia. You are a great goddess." I said that and dropped to my knees before her.</p><p>A cry of dismay and pain tore from Anastasia's lips. She quickly rose, tottering back from me, leaned against the wall, and, as if in supplication, pressed her hands to her chest.</p><p>"Vladimir, I beg you, get off your knees. You mustn't worship me. My God, my God, what have I done? I was in too much of a hurry. Forgive me for the incomprehensibility of my explanations to Your sons. Vladimir, all people are equal before God. There should be no worship among them. I am just a woman. I'm a human being!"</p><p>"You're very different from all people, Anastasia, and if you're just a human being, then who are we? Who am I?"</p><p>"You're human, too. But living through the commotion of your age, you have still not been able to think about your purpose."</p><p>"Moses, Jesus Christ, Mohammad, Rama, Buddha—who are they? What do you think of them?"</p><p>"You've named my older brothers, Vladimir. I have no right to judge their deeds, but I will say one thing: none of them received earthly love in full."</p><p>"That can't be. Each of them even now has millions of worshippers."</p><p>"Worship doesn't mean love. It takes the power of thought inherent only to a human from a person who worships someone. Great is the collective psychic consciousness of my brothers. For millions of years, many people have nourished it, while at the same time each worshipper has decreased his own energy. Over the ages quite a few have eagerly condemned my brothers' actions, and I could not understand why they had been feeding their psychic entity so assiduously and accumulating energy for millennia. No one was able to guess their secret until now. The brothers issued a decision to gather what had accumulated into a single whole and pass out their energy to the people now living on Earth. The Earth's new millennium was coming, and in it gods would populate the Earth—the people whose awareness allowed them to receive the energy.</p><p>"Vladimir, I implore you, get off your knees! Any father would be pained to see his enslaved, prostrate son. Only what is dark has tried to demean human significance. Vladimir, get off your knees. Do not betray yourself. Do not turn away from me."</p><p>Anastasia was terribly agitated, so I stood up and said, "I never did turn away. On the contrary, I think I've started to understand you. Only I don't agree that worship interferes with love. On the contrary, they say all believers love God. I was bowing to you as to a goddess, but for some reason you got frightened, agitated."</p><p>"You and I have known each other for more than five years, Vladimir. Quite a few days have passed since the night our son was conceived, but since that time, the desire has never once arisen in you to touch me, to look at me with the look you have given other women. Your lack of understanding and now worship in addition are not allowing love to unfold. Children are not born out of worship."</p><p>"Well, this is because you are no longer like a woman to me, Anastasia, you're more like an information bundle. I am not the only one who thinks so. Others, too, do not immediately understand what you say. What does 'do not betray yourself' mean? Why did you say that of me?"</p><p>"You wrote a letter to the Russian president, Vladimir, but you doubted yourself in doing that and nearly perished. You stopped creating and laid your problems on someone else, and that someone else was just one president."</p><p>"Well, that's because he alone in Russia can actually do something."</p><p>"He alone can't, it takes the will of the majority. Not only that, why did you appeal to only one president? There is a president in Ukraine, in Belarus, in Kazakhstan."</p><p>"Because you only spoke about Russia, and Russia is my homeland."</p><p>"But your passport says you're a Belarusian."</p><p>"Yes, Belarusian. My father was a Belarusian."</p><p>"And you spent your childhood in Ukraine."</p><p>"Well, yes, I did. And this is the best thing I remember about myself from childhood. Our white cottage, the thatched roof, and the levee where the neighbor kids and I would fish for carp. My grandfather and grandmother never once yelled at me and never punished me."</p><p>"Yes, yes, Vladimir, and remember how you and your grandfather planted tiny saplings in your orchard?"</p><p>"I remember. My grandmother watered them from a bucket."</p><p>"Even now in Kuzdnichi, the Ukrainian village where you were born, the orchard remains, and its hardened trees are still bearing fruit. They are waiting for you."</p><p>"So where is my homeland, Anastasia?"</p><p>"It's inside you."</p><p>"Inside me?"</p><p>"Inside you! Materialize it for eternity on earth wherever your soul suggests."</p><p>"Yes, I should sort all this out because now I feel as though I'm smeared over the earth."</p><p>"Vladimir, you're tired. The day just passed brought us many emotions. Lie down, go to sleep. Sleep will build up new strength for you by morning and a new awareness will come."</p><p>I lay down on the bed and felt Anastasia take my hand in hers. A deep sleep would come to me soon. I already knew that she could make sleep deep and peaceful, so that I would feel good in the morning, but before I fell asleep, I managed to say, "You know, Anastasia, please make it so that I can see Russia's beautiful future again."</p><p>"Fine. Go to sleep, Vladimir, and you will see it."</p><p>In a quiet voice, Anastasia sang without words, like a lullaby. "It's great, really, that people can program everything for themselves," I managed to think as I plunged into a pleasant and peaceful dream about Russia's future.</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter id=0521>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>21. Eternity Lies Ahead for You and Me</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br><img class=kumar src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Anastasia-Vladimir-Megre-Ringing-Cedars-of-Russia-vk.com-kumar82.png></div></p></p><p> </p><p>The rising sun shown through the undrawn curtains right on the bed and woke me up. A great night's sleep! Inside I felt unusual forces had appeared, and my mood was excellent. I even felt like doing exercises or something else physical. I heard dishes clattering in the kitchen. "Oh my," I thought, "is Anastasia really trying to cook breakfast? She doesn't know how to use all the devices in the kitchen or how to turn on the gas. Maybe I should help?" I put on a track suit, opened the door to the kitchen, and the moment I saw Anastasia, a wave of heat seemed to run through me.</p><p>For the first time I saw the taiga hermit Anastasia not in the Siberian forest, in her taiga glade, or on the seashore, but in the most ordinary of ordinary situations for an urban woman—in the kitchen. She was leaning over the gas stove and trying to adjust the burner. She kept raising and lowering the gas, but the old gas stove would not adjust smoothly.</p><p>In the kitchen, Anastasia looked a completely normal woman. Why had I frightened her yesterday with my genuflection? I must have had too much to drink and been extremely tired.</p><p>Anastasia felt me looking at her, and she turned toward me. One cheek had a little flour on it, and a lock of hair had escaped her kerchief and was sticking to her lightly perspiring forehead. Anastasia was smiling. And her voice . . . her marvelous voice . . .</p><p>"Good morning and a beautiful day to you, Vladimir. I've almost made everything for breakfast. I have a little more to do. You go wash up and everything will be ready. You go wash up now, don't worry, I won't ruin anything here, I figured it out."</p><p>I didn't go to the bathroom right away. I stood there, entranced, watching Anastasia. For the first time in the five years I'd known her, I saw for real how unusually, indescribably beautiful this woman was. Even with a floury cheek, even without her hair done, simply tied up in a bun, and simple, unstylish clothing, she was still unusually beautiful.</p><p>I went to the bathroom, shaved carefully, and took a shower, but I couldn't get Anastasia and her beauty out of my head. I went from the bathroom to my room and sat down on the already-made bed, still not going to the kitchen but continuing to think about Anastasia with agitation, for some reason.</p><p>I had known this woman—the hermit from the Siberian taiga—for five years, and how everything had changed in my life since we had met. We saw each other rarely, but it was as if she were by my side always. Of course, it was thanks to her that my interaction with my daughter had improved. We now had a beautiful relationship. Furthermore, I would call my wife, even though I had not been home once in five years, and from her voice could tell that she had begun to speak to me without rancor or coldness. She told me that everything was fine in the family.</p><p>It was Anastasia who had cured me, after all. The doctors couldn't, but she could. I myself realized I might die, but she cured me and she made me famous. Now they were offering me large fees for my books, and after all, it was her words there. She always spoke kindly and was never angry. You could be desperately angry at her, and she still would not get mad. Of course, she had significantly changed my life, but changed it for the better. It was she who had given birth to a son for me! Of course, it was an irregular
 situation. My son was living in a glade in the taiga, but he was probably happy with her. She was very good. I should say something nice to her and do something good for her. Only what? She didn't need anything. This was just the way it was; you could own half the world, but she still seemed to have more. Nonetheless, I felt like giving her at least something. I had bought her a pearl necklace long ago. Not artificial but large, natural pearls. I decided I would go right now and give them to her. I got the case out of my suitcase, took the necklace out of it, and instead of going straight into the kitchen, for some reason I changed my clothes. Instead of track pants, I put on a white shirt and even a tie. Then I put the pearls in my trouser pocket. But I couldn't go to the kitchen because I was still so agitated. I stood by the window all dolled up. Then I finally took myself in hand. "What on earth is this," I thought, "this idiotic agitation"—and I went into the kitchen.</p><p>Anastasia rose to meet me, having been sitting, waiting, at the table she had laid for breakfast. She had already tidied her hair. She stood up and looked at me in silence with the kindly gaze of her gray-blue eyes. I stood there not knowing what to say. Then I said, for some reason using the formal "you," "Hello, Anastasia." This formal "you" threw me off completely.</p><p>But as if she hadn't noticed, she replied seriously, "Hello, Vladimir. Sit down, please. Breakfast is waiting for you."</p><p>"I will in a moment. First I wanted to tell you something. . . . This is what I wanted to say . . ." But I couldn't remember the words.</p><p>"Go ahead and tell me, Vladimir."</p><p>But I'd forgotten what I'd wanted to say. I walked right up to Anastasia and kissed her on the cheek. My entire body blazed up as if on fire. Anastasia's cheeks flushed, and she fluttered her eyelashes faster than usual. And I spoke in a constricted voice unlike my own:</p><p>"This is for you from all our readers, Anastasia. Many people are grateful to you."</p><p>"Our readers? Thank you very much to all our readers. Thank you very much," she whispered softly.</p><p>Then I quickly kissed her other cheek and said, "This is from me. You are very fine and good, Anastasia. You are very beautiful, Anastasia. Thank you for being you."</p><p>"Do you think I’m beautiful, Vladimir? Thank you. You really think so?"</p><p>She was on edge as well. I didn't know what to do next. But then I remembered the pearls in my pocket. Very quickly I took them out and began unhooking the clasp.</p><p>"This is a gift for you, Anastasia. These are pearls—real ones, not artificial. I know you don't like anything artificial, but these are real pearls."</p><p>The clasp wouldn't yield, I jerked it, the string broke, and all the pearls strung on it spilled over the kitchen floor and rolled the floor in different directions. I knelt to pick them up, and Anastasia began gathering them, too. She was quicker. I watched her collect the pearls in her palm. She examined each closely, and I admired her movements. I was sitting right on the floor, leaning against the wall, and watching her, enchanted. I was sitting and thinking to myself of the ordinariness of the standard kitchen compared to how extraordinary and beautiful I felt inside. Why? Probably because she was in this kitchen: Anastasia. She was so close, but I didn't have the nerve to put my arms around her. This woman, who then, at first, in the taiga, five years ago now, had not seemed like an entirely normal hermit, now seemed like a star that had descended from the sky for a moment. She was so close but, like a star, unattainable. And the years . . . Oh, my years. . . . I watched steadily as Anastasia stood up and put the pearls she'd gathered in a saucer on the table. Then she turned her head toward me. I, rapt, kept sitting on the kitchen floor, leaning against the wall, and looking into her gray-blue eyes. She did not break her kind glance.</p><p>"You're so close, Anastasia, but I can't touch you now. It feels as though you are a distant star in the sky."</p><p>"A star? That's what you feel? Why? Look! At your feet she, a little star, has become an ordinary woman."</p><p>Anastasia quickly dropped to her knees and sat next to me on the floor. She placed both hands on my shoulder and leaned her head. I heard her heart beating, only mine was thumping much harder. Her hair smelled of the taiga. Her breath, like a warm breeze, intoxicated me with the fragrance of flowers.</p><p>"Anastasia, why didn't I meet you as a young man? You're so young, and I'm so very old. I've lived nearly half a century."</p><p>"And I have been making my way toward your wandering soul for ages. Don't drive me away now."</p><p>"I'll be growing old soon, Anastasia. And my life will end."</p><p>"But while you are growing old, you'll plant your family tree and lay out a city of the beautiful future with others, and a marvelous orchard."</p><p>"I'll try. It's too bad I myself will not be able to live in that orchard. It will take many a year to grow."</p><p>"If you plant it, you will always live in it."</p><p>"Always?"</p><p>"Naturally. Your body will age and die, but your soul will soar."</p><p>"The dead man's soul soars, I know that. The soul soars and all that."</p><p>"Oh, how beautiful today is! Why are you creating such a joyless future, Vladimir? You are creating it for yourself."</p><p>"It's not I who is creating it. That is the objective reality. Old age comes and then death, for everyone. Even you, my dear dreamer, can't come up with anything else."</p><p>Anastasia roused herself, leaned back slightly, and her merry and good eyes looked into mine and shone, joyously confident despite all odds.</p><p>"I don't need to think up anything, the truth is always the same. There is death for the flesh; clearly this is for everyone. As for all the rest, death is a dream, Vladimir."</p><p>"A dream?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Anastasia rose from her knees and began speaking, looking me straight in the eye. But she spoke in such a way that the radio in the kitchen fell silent, and the voices and noise outside quieted down when Anastasia said in a quiet voice, "My beloved! An eternity lies ahead of you and me. Life always asserts itself. The sun's beam will sparkle in spring and the soul will be dressed all in new. But the mortal body will not meekly embrace the earth in vain. Fresh flowers and grass will come up form our bodies in spring. You will hear the singing of birds and drink the raindrops forever. The eternal clouds in the blue sky will delight you with their dance. If you scatter like dust through the vast Universe, maintaining your disbelief, I will assemble you out of the dust in the wandering eternities, my beloved. The tree you plant will help me, and in early spring it will reach its little branch toward where your soul abides in insensible peace. Whoever you have given good to on earth will think about you with love. If all earthly love is not enough for your embodiment, then one love—you know which—will blaze up at every level of the Universe's being with a single desire—"be embodied, beloved"—and for a moment she herself will die.</p><p>"Will this be you, Anastasia? Are you certain you will be able to do that?"</p><p>"Any woman can do that if she can squeeze the Logos into her feelings."</p><p>"And what about you, Anastasia? Who will help you return to earth again?"</p><p>"I can do that myself without putting anyone out."</p><p>"But how will I know you? After all, life will be completely different then."</p><p>"When you are embodied on earth once again, you will be an adolescent. You will see a wimpy little red-headed girl in the garden next to yours. Say a kind word to the little one with the slightly bent legs, and turn your attention to the girl. You will grow up, become a young man, and you will start sending your gaze after beauties. Don't be in any hurry to link your fate to them. In the garden next door the little freckle-faced girl will grow up, still not a beauty. One day you will see her watching you stealthily. Don't laugh, though, don't drive her away when, all shy, she comes up to you to distract you from a mature beauty. Another three springs will pass and the neighbor girl will become a beautiful young woman. One day you will look at her and blaze up with love for her. You will be happy with her, and she will be happy. Vladimir, my soul will live in that happy girl you've chosen."</p><p>"Thank you for the wonderful dream, Anastasia, my dear storyteller."</p><p>I took her cautiously by the shoulders and drew her to me. I wanted to listen to her heart beating so ardently, to breathe in the smell of the hair of the beautiful woman who believed only in the good and in eternity. Maybe I also wanted to hold onto her incredible dreams, like a straw. Her words about the future made everything around me joyous.</p><p>"Even if what you say is only words, Anastasia, still they are beautiful, and when you hear them, you feel joy inside."</p><p>"The words of the dream put great energy in motion. Through his dream and intentions, man himself creates his own future. Believe me, Vladimir, everything will happen exactly as I have drawn it in words for us. But you are free in your own dream, and you can change it all by saying other words. You have free will, and each person is his own creator."</p><p>"I am not going to change anything you said, Anastasia. I am going to try to believe in them."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"What for?"</p><p>"For not destroying eternity for the two of us."</p><p>* * *</p><p>That beautiful sunny day we bathed in the sea and sunned on the deserted shore. That evening, Anastasia left. As always, she asked me not to see her off. I stood on the balcony and watched her walk down the sidewalk along the building, her head covered in a scarf, wearing her very simple clothing, with her homemade canvas bag. She walked, trying not to stand out among the other passersby, a woman who had created a beautiful future for the entire country. It will definitely come, people will materialize her dream, and they themselves will come to live
 in a beautiful world.</p><p>Before turning the corner, Anastasia stopped, turned toward me, and waved. I waved to Anastasia in parting, too. I couldn't see her face anymore, but I was sure she was smiling. She always smiles because she believes in and creates only what is good. Maybe this is the way it should be. I waved to her, too, and whispered to myself, "Thank you, Nastenka!"</p><p> </p><p><p><div class=chapter>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>Addendum</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p></p><p> </p><p>The lands of Rostov Province (almost 50 percent of the Salsk steppes), Altai District (a third of the Kulundin steppes), and thirteen other Russian Federation subjects have been overtaken by desertification. The unstable sands take up 6.5 million hectares. Overall, the greatest portion of them (nearly 10 percent of the total area) is in the Caspian Lowlands. The total area of Russia's soils subject to desertification or potentially threatened in this respect approaches 50 million hectares.</p><p>According to agrochemical indices, Russia's arable lands have an average low productivity, especially outside the Black Earth region. The arable layer lacks sufficient nutrient elements for agricultural crops: nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and trace elements (especially cobalt, molybdenum, and zinc). Acid soils comprise more than a third of arable lands, and soils with a low content of available phosphorous and potassium comprise 30 and 10 percent, respectively.</p><p>More than 43 percent of arable lands are characterized by a low humus content, including a critically low content of 15 percent. In areas outside the Black Earth region, the proportion of the latter rises to 45 percent. More than 75 percent of the low-humus soils are in the arable lands of Kaluga, Smolensk, Astrakhan, and Volgograd provinces and the republics of Kalmykia, Adygeia, Buryatia, and Tuva. Experts believe that, on average, depletion of Russia's soils in connection with the irregular and insufficient application of organic fertilizers and the breakdown in the system of agriculture has led to a reduction in humus content to a minimal level: 1.3-1.5 percent in the arable layer of the zone outside the Black Earth region; 3.-5.0 percent in the central Black Earth areas. Annual losses of humus on arable land are estimated at 0.6-0.7 metric tons per hectare and up to 1.0 metric tons per hectare on Black Earth; or about 80 million metric tons for the country overall.</p><p>It has been proven that there is virtually a linear connection between humus reserves in the main types of soils and the yield of the most important agricultural crops. When the humus reserve is increased by 1 metric ton per hectare, the average multi-year productivity of grain crops on Black Earth lands increases an average of 0.10-0.15 centners per hectare. For a number of crops raised in different soil and climate conditions, this can go up to 0.3 centners of grain units. When the capacity of Black Earth humus horizons decreases by 1 centimeter under the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors (especially erosion), crop yields drop by 1 centner per hectare.</p><p>For many years, Russia's land resources have been extensively exploited, and the extraction of nutritive elements with the harvest frequently outpaced their addition to the soil.</p><p>Agricultural scientists warn that the extensive exploitation of soils' fertility will lead to irreversible decline. The dynamic of gross crop harvest confirms this warning. Annually, the dose of manure for supporting a nondeficit humus balance should be 7-15 metric tons per hectare. This requires introducing into the soil annually at least 1 billion metric tons of organic fertilizers. Currently, about 100-120 million metric tons are being applied in Russia, or virtually one tenth of what is required.</p><p>What is happening right now with the renewal of land resources?</p><p>Centralized financing for cultivating lands has halted entirely, and their volumes have dropped catastrophically. Financing is being cut from local budgets. Instead, since 1993, it comes from a land tax and 30 percent of this at the landowner's expense. As a result, from 1994 to the present, all work to introduce peat and manure composts in the zone outside the Black Earth region, as well as the liming of acid soils and the supply of lime and phosphates, have stopped, as has the adding of phosphates over a large territory of Russia because of local administrations' lack of funds to carry out agrochemical enrichment.</p><p>Virtually all the Agricultural Ministry and Russian government's complex federal programs to improve soil fertility and develop agricultural production remain unimplemented.</p><p>Taking into account the above, we can talk about the continuing degradation of Russia's soil cover, which constitutes a threat to the country's ecology, food supply, and national security.</p><p class=tbc></p><p>

</br></div>
</p><p>
In a private clinic, a large plaque on the office door announced that visitors would be seen by a medical doctor, a specialist in child psychology. The plaque indicated the full name of the doctor who had been recommended to me as one of the best scientific luminaries on the parent-child relationship. I signed up for the last appointment so as not to limit myself or him regarding time. If the conversation proved useful, I could offer to pay the doctor an additional fee to continue this conversation, which was important to me.</p><p>
Sitting at his desk in the office was a sad-faced man of retirement age. He was wearily putting written pages into a file.</p><p>
After suggesting that I sit down, the doctor put a blank piece of paper in front of himself and said, "I'm listening. What are your problems?"</p><p>
In order not to tell the long story of my taiga encounter with Anastasia, I tried to set forth the matter as briefly as possible.</p><p>
"Alexander Sergeyevich, I need to establish contact with a child, my son, who will soon turn five."</p><p>
"You believe you have lost contact with your son?" the psychologist asked wearily and apathetically.</p><p>
"There hasn't been any conscious contact as such. As it turned out, the child and I have almost never interacted since his birth. I saw him in his infancy, but then. . . . I've never once spoken to him, and basically, he began making sense of life without me. We lived apart, but now I am about to have a meeting with my five-year-old son and a conversation with him. Are there any methods that can help me make the child like me? There are instances when a man marries a woman who already has a child and somehow he establishes a connection with him and becomes a father and friend to him."</p><p>
"There are methods, of course, but they aren't always equally effective. Much in the parent-child relationship depends on the individuals and their personalities."</p><p>
"I realize that, but I still would like to know those specific methods."</p><p>
"Specific. . . Well . . . When you appear in the family—and you have to realize that even one woman and her child is a family—try to disturb their existing way of life as little as possible. For a while, you'll be an outsider for your son, and you have to reconcile yourself to that. In the beginning, you have to take a close look at everything and let them take a close look at you. Try to link your appearance with the fulfillment of the child's previously unfulfilled wishes and dreams. Find out from his mother what kind of toy he's dreamed of but she couldn't buy for him. You yourself should not buy that toy. Somehow start a conversation with the child about your own childhood, your own toys, and tell him that you were dreaming about it. If he picks up the conversation and tells you his own desire to have the same toy, suggest that you go to the store together and acquire the desired toy. What is important is the actual process of the conversation and the trip together. The boy has to trust you with his dream and allow you to help make it come true."</p><p>
"The example with toys doesn't suit me very well. My son has never seen the toys they sell in stores."</p><p>
"That's odd. . . . I guess that means it won't do. . . . Be a good boy and come clean. If you want to hear advice you can use, then tell me in detail about your relationship with the woman who bore you a son. Who is she? Where does she work? Where does she live? How well off is her family? What do you see as the reason for your falling out?"</p><p>
I realized that if I was to hear more specific advice from the psychologist, I was going to have to tell him about my relationship with Anastasia, something I hadn't sorted out for myself very well yet, so I couldn't imagine how to set it out for the psychologist. Without giving her name, I told him the following:</p><p>
"She lives in a very remote location, in Siberia. I met her by chance when I was there on a trading expedition. Since the beginning of perestroika I'd been doing business in Siberia. I would take a ship with various goods into remote areas on the Ob River and bring back fish, furs, and wild plants."</p><p>
"I see. So it's like Paratov: the merchant made merry along the Siberian river to the envy of all."</p><p>
"I didn't make merry, I worked. Entrepreneurs always have plenty of cares."</p><p>
"Let's say they do, but you entrepreneurs also find time to enjoy yourselves."</p><p>
"What happened between this woman and me was anything but enjoyment. I wanted to have a son by this woman. I'd wanted a son before, and then seemed to forget my desire. The years passed . . . and when I saw her . . . She is so healthy, young, and beautiful. . . . These days almost all the woman are so puny and sickly, but she is healthy and blooming. So I thought that a child would be handsome and healthy, too. She bore me a son. I went to see them when my son was very little, before he could walk or talk. I held him in my arms. I've had no contact with him since."</p><p>
"Why haven't you had contact with him?"</p><p>
How was I supposed to explain to this person in a short conversation everything I'd written about in several books? How was I supposed to tell him that Anastasia had refused to leave her taiga glade and move to town with her son, while I was unsuited to life in the taiga? And that it was she who had not given me the opportunity not only to give him traditional toys but simply to interact with him. Every summer I went to the Siberian taiga, to the glade where Anastasia and my son lived, but I never did manage to see my son. Each time, he was away from Anastasia and with her grandfather and great-grandfather, who lived nearby, in the depths of the trackless Siberian taiga. Anastasia refused to take me to see them, and moreover, each time she insisted that I first had to prepare myself for my conversation with my son.</p><p>
Trying to touch on the topic of raising children, I asked many of my friends the same question, which always elicited perplexity and bafflement, though it was quite simple:</p><p>
"Have you ever had a serious conversation with your child?"</p><p>
In the end, it always turned out that everyone's conversation topics were identical: "Go eat . . . It's time for bed . . . Don't misbehave . . . Pick up your toys . . . Have you done your homework?"</p><p>
The child grows up and goes to school, but many either don't have the time to talk with him about the meaning of life, man's purpose, or even simply about what kind of life awaits him, or else they don't consider a conversation like that important. Perhaps they think the time hasn't yet come, that they'll still have time. But they don't. The child grows up. . . .</p><p>
But what if we ourselves don't even try to talk seriously with our children? Then who is raising them?</p><p>
Why wouldn't Anastasia let me interact with my own son all these years? I don't know what she was afraid of or fending off.</p><p>
Finally, the day came when she suddenly asked, "Vladimir, do you feel ready to meet your son and talk?" I told her I wanted to meet him, but I couldn't say the word 'ready.'"</p><p>
All these years I'd read everything I could find on the relationship between parents and children. I'd written books and spoken at conferences in various countries, but I had almost never written or spoken about the main thing that had interested me all these years: raising children and the relationship between them and the older generation.</p><p>
I had given thought to many pieces of advice from the childrearing literature. However, most often I recalled what Anastasia had said: "Raising children means raising yourself." For a long time I couldn't quite understand the meaning of this, but ultimately I drew a firm conclusion: our children are raised not by parental lectures, or kindergarten, school, and college. Our children are raised by our way of life: our way of life, the way of life of society as a whole. And no matter what is said by parents or by teachers in schools, no matter what wise educational systems have been applied, children will follow the way of life of the majority of people around them.</p><p>
</p><p>Consequently, the raising of children turns out to depend wholly on your own worldview, on how you yourself, your parents, and society as a whole live. A sick, unhappy society gives birth to sick, unhappy children.</p><p>
"If you don't tell me in detail about your relationship with the mother of your son, it's going to be hard for me to give you effective advice," the psychologist interrupted the extended pause.</p><p>
"It would take me a long time to tell you about that. But in a nutshell, life took shape in such a way that I haven't interacted with my son for several years, that's all there is to it."</p><p>
"Fine, then tell me. All those years, did you give your child's mother material assistance? I think, for an entrepreneur, material assistance is the simplest sign of attention to his family."</p><p>
"No, I didn't. She believes she has everything she needs."</p><p>
"You mean she's very rich?"</p><p>
"Just that she has everything."</p><p>
Alexander Sergeyevich rose abruptly from behind his desk and spoke rapidly:</p><p>
"She's living in the Siberian taiga. She leads a hermit's life. Her name is Anastasia, your son is Volodya, and you yourself are Vladimir Nikolaevich. I recognized you. I've read your books, and more than once."</p><p>
"Yes. . . ."</p><p>
Agitated, Alexander Sergeyevich began pacing around his office, and then he spoke again.</p><p>
"Yes . . . Yes . . . Have I really found it? I've figured it out. Answer one question for me, please. Answer! This is very important for me, for science. Although no, don't answer. I'll tell you myself. I'm beginning to see. I'm certain that all these years since meeting Anastasia you have been intensively studying psychology and philosophy. You've been thinking constantly about raising children. Isn't that so?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"But the conclusions you made after reading those 'smart' books and articles didn't satisfy you. Then you started searching for answers inside yourself or, in other words, to ponder the rising generation and how to raise children, right?</p><p>
"That's right, probably. But mostly about my son."</p><p>
"It's inseparably linked. You came to see me when you had despaired and lost most hope of obtaining answers to the questions that had arisen for you. If you don't get them from me, you'll continue your search."</p><p>
"Probably."</p><p>
"So. . . . It's stunning. . . . I'll give you the name of someone who is incomparably more powerful and wise than me."</p><p>
"Who is this person and how can I get an appointment?"</p><p>
"This person is your Anastasia, Vladimir Nikolaevich."</p><p>
"Anastasia? But lately she has said very little about raising children. And she's the one who would not allow me to interact with my son."</p><p>
"That's it exactly. Anastasia. Up until this moment, I too could not find a logical explanation for this conduct on her part. It's an incredible act. A loving woman suddenly tells a future father that he should not interact with his own son. It's an irregular situation, one never before encountered. But the result! . . . The result is stunning! After all, she was able to compel . . . No, that word doesn't suit this situation. Anastasia was able to entice . . . Who? Excuse me, to compel a not very well-educated entrepreneur to take an interest in psychology, philosophy, and childrearing issues. You've been thinking about this all these years, and the very fact that you came to see me attests to this. All these years, she's been raising your son alone, but simultaneously she's been raising you, too. She's been preparing for the meeting between father and son."</p><p>
"She truly has raised our son alone. As for me, I don't think so. She and I have seen each other so rarely. And the visits have been brief."</p><p>
"But the information she gives you during these, as you say, brief visits, still needs to be comprehended. Stunning information. Vladimir Nikolaevich, you say that Anastasia has been talking very little about raising children, but that's not true."</p><p>
Alexander Sergeyevich quickly walked over to his desk and took a fat gray notebook out of the drawer, carefully stroked it, and continued.</p><p>
"From your books I've taken down, in a specific order, all of Anastasia's statements about bearing and raising children, omitting the plot details, although I may have been wrong to take the quotations out of context. The story line is undoubtedly important for easing perception. Anastasia's statements conceal the very great and, I would say, philosophical meaning and wisdom of a most ancient culture. I'm inclined to surmise—and I'm not the only one—that these postulates are set forth in a very ancient book whose age is calculated in the millions of years. Anastasia's speeches are distinguished for their depth and for the accuracy of expression of what we view to be the most important thoughts set forth in very ancient manuscripts and modern scholarly works. When I was writing down separately everything that concerned bearing and raising children, the result was a treatise that has no equals in the world. I am certain that on its basis many dissertations will be defended, quite a few academic degrees awarded, and stunning discoveries made, but the main thing lies elsewhere: a new race will appear on Earth, and its name will be 'Man!'"</p><p>
"Man exists now as it is."</p><p>
"I think, from the standpoint of the future, the fact of man's existence could be placed in doubt."</p><p>
"How's that? You and I exist. How can anyone doubt our existence?"</p><p>
"Our bodies exist, and we call them 'people.' But the content and psychological state of human individuals in the future will differ significantly from our own, and consequently, emphasizing the difference, the name must be changed. It may be that today's people will be called 'man of that period' or people born in the future will be called something different."</p><p>
"Is it all really so serious?"</p><p>
"Both serious and indisputable. Here you've read many books written by scholars about rearing children. Now tell me, at what period does a child's education begin?"</p><p>
"Some authors believe you have to start at one."</p><p>
"That's it exactly. At best, one. But Anastasia has shown how a person is shaped even before. I'm sure you just thought: 'In the mother's womb.' But she proved that parents can shape their future child even before the spermatozoa and ovum meet. And this can be explained scientifically. Anastasia stands above all psychologists who now exist or have ever existed on Earth. Her statements are weighty. They encompass all periods of a child's development and upbringing: pre-conception, conception, in utero, and so forth.</p><p>
"She touches upon topics that neither the sages of the past nor modern scholars have been able to comprehend. She has stressed something without which a sound human being cannot be born or raised."</p><p>
"I don't remember anything like that. I didn't write about periods."</p><p>
"You wrote books testifying to events. Anastasia realized you would write in precisely this way. And then came the next move: she herself began shaping these events, basically fitting the greatest scientific work into an attractive narrative form. She used her life to create your book, bringing people priceless knowledge.</p><p>
"Most readers sense this intuitively. Many are ecstatic from the books but cannot completely understand the reason for their admiration, and they consider the information previously unknown to them on a subconscious level. But it can be perceived consciously as well. I'll prove this to you right now. We have before us a synopsis of Anastasia's statements on man's birth. A colleague and I have painstakingly worked through and commented on them. He has a doctorate in medical sciences, he's a sexual pathologist, and he sees patients in the next office. We've conducted experiments and analyzed the situation."</p><p>
Alexander Sergeyevich opened his notebook and began reading with some agitation and solemnity.</p><p>
"And so, the beginning. . . . The period of preconception. In the past and present visible to modern society, it has barely been considered as an aspect of childrearing. But today it is perfectly clear that on Earth or somewhere in the vast expanses of the Universe there existed or exists a culture under which relations between a man and a woman lie incomparably closer to perfection than today's. Furthermore, the period of preconception was an important component, if not the foundation, of raising a human being.</p><p>
"Following the cultural ways of a civilization unknown to us, Anastasia carries out certain preparations before conceiving a child. She blunted your sexual attraction. As a psychologist, I can see this clearly from the events described in your first book. I will remind you of them.</p><p>
"You and Anastasia are resting in the taiga. You're drinking brandy and snacking, and Anastasia doesn't touch the food and drink you offer her. She takes off her outer clothing and lies down on the grass. You're stunned by her natural beauty and a natural desire arises in you to possess this beautiful female body. In a sexual burst, you make an attempt at intimacy and touching her body, you lose consciousness.</p><p>
"We won't go into the details of how she made you lose consciousness. What is important is something else. As a result you ceased to perceive Anastasia as an object for the satisfaction of your sexual need. You yourself tell about this. I wrote down what you said: 'I never even had the thought. . . .'</p><p>
"Yes. It's true, after the incident at the resting stop I never felt sexual desires toward Anastasia again."</p><p>
"Now the second event—conception—the story about the culture of the child's conception.</p><p>
"Your overnight in the cozy den, the fragrance of dry herbs and flowers. But you're not used to sleeping alone in the taiga, and you ask Anastasia to lie down beside you. You already realize that if she's beside you nothing bad will happen to you. She lies down beside you.</p><p>
"In this way, in the most intimate situation, you find yourself next to a very beautiful young female body that stands out for one other characteristic: it radiates health. Unlike most of the women's bodies you've seen before, it truly does exude health. You smell the aroma of Anastasia's breath, but at the same time, no sexual attraction arises in you. It's been driven out of you. The space has been cleansed for another psychological state—the desire to continue the line. You're thinking about a son! A son who does not yet exist. Here is what you said in the book: 'It would be wonderful if I had a son by Anastasia. She's so healthy. That means my son would be healthy and handsome, too.' You involuntarily put your hand on Anastasia's breast and caress her, but these are different caresses now. They're not sexual. It's as if you're caressing your son. Then you write about your lips touching, about Anastasia's light breath, and then . . . a total absence of any details whatsoever. You go on immediately to describe the morning, your wonderful mood, your feeling of unusual accomplishment. I'm certain your publishers suggested that you describe that night in more detail, to make the book more popular."</p><p>
"Yes, people did suggest more than once that I do that."</p><p>
"Nevertheless, you did not describe that night in any of the book's new editions. Why?"</p><p>
"Because . . ."</p><p>
"Stop! Please, don't say. I want to check myself and the accuracy of my conclusions. You didn't describe the sexual details of that night because you remember absolutely nothing after your lips touched Anastasia's."</p><p>
"Yes, I don't remember and can't recall anything other than that unusual feeling in the morning."</p><p>
"You'll think what I'm going to tell you now is incredible. That beautiful night with Anastasia, there was no sex."</p><p>
"There wasn't? But what about my son? I saw my son myself."</p><p>
"That night you did have physical intimacy. There were spermatozoa . . . basically, everything that goes along with conceiving children, but there wasn't any sex. My colleagues and I have analyzed what happened to you more than once. They are convinced, as am I, that you and Anastasia did not have sex.</p><p>
"In our era, the very word 'sex' assumes the satisfaction of carnal needs, the desire to obtain carnal pleasures. But in the context of the events of that taiga night that goal is absent, by which I mean that you were not trying to obtain carnal satisfaction. There was another desire and goal: a child. Consequently, the event should be called something different. This is not merely a matter of terminology here but of a qualitatively different means of bearing a human being.</p><p>
"I want to repeat this again: this is a qualitatively different means of bearing a human being. My assertion is not abstract and can be easily proven by scientific comparisons. Judge for yourself. No psychologist or physiologist today would deny the effect of external psychological factors on the formation of the embryo in the mother's uterus. Among other things, of great and often dominant importance is the relationship between the man and the pregnant woman. Nor can we deny the effect on the formation of the future human being of the relationship between the man and woman at the moment of their sexual intimacy. In one instance, it is a relationship as toward an object of gratification of carnal desire; in the other, as toward a co-creator. Consequently, the result is going to be different, too. A child conceived under such conditions may differ as strikingly in level of intellect as modern man does from the ape.</p><p>
</p><p>"Sex and the pleasure connected with it during co-creation are not goals in themselves, but merely a means. Other psychological energies will guide the bodies and shape the child's condition otherwise.</p><p>
"The above implies the first rule: a woman wishing to give birth to a full-fledged human being–to create a stable, happy family–must be able to catch the moment when the man wants to be intimate with her for the purpose of giving birth and can imagine his future child and desire his birth.</p><p>
"Under this condition, the man and woman achieve a psychological state that allows them to obtain supreme pleasure from intimacy, and the future child receives energies lacking in those born the traditional or, rather, random way."</p><p>
"But how does the woman sense that moment? How does she learn the man's thoughts? Thoughts are invisible, after all."</p><p>
"His caresses! You can tell a lot from them. The psychological state is always expressed in outward signs. Joy—laughter, a smile. Sadness—the corresponding expression of the eyes, posture, and so forth. In this case, I don't think it will be especially hard to distinguish purely sexual caresses from those of a man touching a woman as he would his future child. Only given an approach like this can that 'something' occur which, of all beings living on Earth, man alone can experience. No one could ever describe or give a scientific explanation of this 'something.' At the moment it happens, it is impossible to analyze. As a psychologist, I can only suppose that the main thing in this event would be not the merging of two physical bodies, but something immeasurably greater: the merging of two thoughts into one. Or, more precisely, the merging of two sets of feelings into one. The pleasure and contentment experienced during this would significantly surpass mere sexual pleasure. Its duration is not short, as in ordinary sex. The incomprehensible, pleasant state can last for months, years even. This is what shapes a solid, loving family. This is what Anastasia is talking about.</p><p>
"This means that a man who has once experienced this cannot exchange the feeling obtained for mere sexual pleasure. He cannot, he will not want to betray his wife, his beloved. It is from this moment that a family begins to take shape. A happy family!</p><p>
"There's an expression: 'Marriages are made in heaven.' In this case, it wholly corresponds to the event. Judge for yourself. What is the generally accepted testimony of a heavenly marriage today? A piece of paper issued by the registry office and all kinds of church rituals. It's funny, isn't it? Funny and sad.</p><p>
"Anastasia defines it precisely: only the unusual, beautiful state of a man and a woman–the result of which is the birth of a new, fully-fledged human being–can be testimony to a marriage made in heaven.</p><p>
"From my own experience I can add that the majority of children born nowadays are illegitimate. But now . . . Now I'll read the commentaries from my colleague, the sexual pathologist:</p><p>
"'The sexual relations between a man and a woman described in Anastasia give sex a completely new meaning. All the textbooks that have ever existed on this subject, beginning with the ancient Greek and Indian and ending with the modern, become simply naïve and silly compared with the significance of what Anastasia has expressed. In every ancient and modern opus on sex that has come down to us, all the investigations amount to a search for every possible position, technique of caress, and outward attribute. Meanwhile, people's physiological and psychological abilities and resources are different.</p><p>
"'For each individual person just one position, inherent in his character and temperament alone, one specific outward attribute, may be the most effective and acceptable.</p><p>
"'There is unlikely to be in this world a specialist capable of precisely determining from among all the many methods the one most effective for each specific person.</p><p>
"'In order to complete such a task, the specialist must know thousands of existing methods and all their nuances and study the physical and psychological abilities of the specific person. This is impossible.</p><p>
"'Proof of the fact that modern science has not solved the problem of the theory of sexual relations between a man and a woman lies in the increasing loss of potency among the majority of modern men and women. The number of family pairs sexually dissatisfied with each other is mounting. We can change this dismal picture.</p><p>
"'What Anastasia showed attests to the fact that there is a mechanism in nature, certain higher forces capable of resolving the seemingly irresolvable problem in one instant. This mechanism, these forces, find—through the specific condition of two people, a man and a woman—a state and methods of sexual relations exclusive to and inherent in them exclusively.</p><p>
"'Without a doubt, the pleasure obtained in this instance will attain the highest level. It is quite possible that the man and woman who experience this kind of pleasure will maintain their spousal fidelity, regardless of how it is stipulated by laws or rituals.'"</p><p>
Marital fidelity! Marital infidelity! Betrayal.</p><p>
Alexander Sergeyevich rose from behind his desk and continued to speak standing:</p><p>
"Anastasia showed the nature of this phenomenon for the first time, and I remember by heart both her individual sentences and entire monologues. She said: 'They try every possible way to suggest that satisfaction is easily obtained, thinking only of carnal satisfaction, and thereby lead man away from the truth. Poor deceived women who don't know this accept nothing but suffering their whole life, searching for that lost grace. They're looking in the wrong place. No woman can keep a man from straying if she lets herself surrender to him for the sake of satisfying merely carnal needs.' And there's more. . . . Wait . . . Yes . . . 'Later they'll try to take more and more new bodies or use just their own bodies in a trivial and doomed way, aware only intuitively that the grace of a true union keeps moving further away.'</p><p>
"The reason for spousal infidelity indicated is absolutely correct. I can explain this as a psychologist, too. It's all logical. The man and woman, the so-called husband and wife, engage in sex for the sake of sex. They sense intuitively that they are not obtaining sufficient pleasure. They see a specialist; they read additional literature. They're advised to vary their positions and caresses, in short, to engage in a search for greater pleasure through a change of sexual technique.</p><p>
"Note: engage in a search. This might not even be expressed, but they themselves, as Anastasia accurately noted, intuitively sensing the existence of a higher grace, will engage in a search. But where are the boundaries of this search? Is it really limited to a change of positions alone? A change of bodies is its absolutely logical continuation.</p><p>
"'Oh!' society exclaims. 'That is spousal betrayal.' But there is no betrayal here whatsoever, because there are no spouses.</p><p>
"A marriage stipulated by a piece of paper is not a marital union. It is nothing but conventions invented by society.</p><p>
"The marital union must be concluded by a man and a woman through their attainment of that supreme state Anastasia tells us about. She not only talked about it, but showed the means for achieving it. This is a new culture of relations between man and woman."</p><p>
"Alexander Sergeyevich, are you proposing that young people engage in intimate relations with each other before they are officially married?"</p><p>
"That is exactly what most people do anyway, but we're embarrassed to speak about it openly. However, I am not proposing having sex for the sake of sex either before or after the marital union is registered.</p><p>
"We consider ourselves a free society. We have the opportunity to engage freely in depravity. And we do!</p><p>
"Depravity has become an industry. Movies and every kind of pornography, prostitution, rubber women from sex shops—here is the confirmation.</p><p>
"Amid this bacchanalia, which attests to the total helplessness of modern science to understand the nature and purpose of the mechanisms that secure the union of two people, a discovery has appeared like a flash of light.</p><p>
"As a psychologist, I have understood the grandiosity of Anastasia's discovery. She has shown a new culture of relations between man and woman.</p><p>
"The main role in these relations belongs to the woman. Anastasia was able to lead you as well to an understanding of this culture. She was able to do this by using, possibly intuitively, knowledge of some ancient civilization. But we–or rather, my colleague—has proven in practice that a man, too, can . . .</p><p>
"He is a sexual pathologist. He and I have analyzed Anastasia's statements. It was he who was the first to talk about a new culture of relations unknown to us. He was most struck by Anastasia's statement–you must remember it: 'What person would want to appear on earth as a result of merely carnal pleasures? Every person would like to have been created in a great surge of love, the desire to create, rather than appear in the world as the result of merely carnal pleasures.' However, our children appeared in the world purely as a consequence of carnal pleasure. My wife and I wanted a child, so we had sex. I don't even know which day my wife conceived. We started thinking more specifically about the child when she got pregnant. But Anastasia says that a specific state and desire are needed at precisely the moment preceding intimacy. In general, my colleague has more than likely understood more from her statements than I have–or sensed more. He wanted to experience this state. He wanted to have a child, a son. My colleague is already over forty, his wife two years younger. They have two children. As he himself admitted, they have rarely had sex in the last few years. But he brought up the question of a child with his wife. At first she was very surprised at his desire. She said it was too late for her to give birth, but her attitude toward her husband improved. He gave her the book with Anastasia's statements to read. His wife herself began to bring up, not her desire to have a child, but the accuracy of what the book said. One night, my colleague began to caress his wife, thinking not about sex but about his future son. He was probably able to do this the way you did. The only difference is that while Anastasia led you to that state, he achieved it himself. Whether this happened by accident is hard to say, but he did achieve this state, in all likelihood. His wife responded to him with the same caresses. They aren't young, of course, and they didn't experience as strong a sexual attraction as in their youth. Thoughts of a future child probably pushed thoughts about sexual technique into the background. As a result . . . 'something' happened. Neither my colleague nor his wife could recall the details of their intimacy. Like you, they don't remember them. But like you, they talk about their unforgettable, marvelous feelings come morning. My colleague says that he had never experienced anything like it his whole life from intimacy with his wife or other women, of which he had had quite a few.</p><p>
"His forty-year-old wife is now pregnant, in her seventh month. But this is not the main thing. The main thing lies elsewhere: his wife fell in love."</p><p>
"With whom?"</p><p>
"Her husband, Vladimir Nikolaevich. Just imagine, this woman, who had been grumpy and somewhat irritable before, now comes to our clinic sometimes and waits for her husband to finish seeing patients. She sits in the waiting room and waits, like a girl in love. I have often stolen a glance at the expression on her face. That, too, has changed. There is now a faint, secret smile. I have known this family for a long time. About eight years. A despondent, stout woman suddenly looked ten years younger. She became beautiful, despite her obvious pregnancy."</p><p>
"Did your colleague's attitude toward his wife change as well, or did it remain unchanged?"</p><p>
"He himself changed. He completely gave up drinking, though he had been badly abusing it, and he quit smoking. He and his wife's favorite hobby now is drawing."</p><p>
"Drawing? What do they draw?"</p><p>
"They draw their future homestead, the one Anastasia spoke about. They want to acquire land and build on it. I shouldn't have said it that way–not build a house but lay the foundations for a heavenly corner for their future children."</p><p>
"Future children?"</p><p>
"Yes. His wife now regrets only that the conception occurred in their apartment rather than on their own homestead, as Anastasia says, in a dimension of Love created by their own hands, where the woman should be during her pregnancy and where births should take place.</p><p>
"My colleague's wife is convinced that she can have another child. My colleague is, too.</p><p>
"I'm convinced that the instinct to continue the line, inherent in animals, differs from the human instinct in that animals copulate guided only by the call of nature. When man engages in so-called sex, he resembles the animals. A child who appears in the world as a result of that process will be half-man and half-animal.</p><p>
"The true human being can be born only when energies and emotions inherent in man alone have a part: love, the ability to see the future, the awareness of what is being created. The word 'sex' isn't appropriate here. It demeans the act. More precise would be the word 'co-creation.' When a man and a woman achieve a state in which co-creation occurs, then they have a union made in heaven. This union is secured not by a piece of paper or a ritual, but by something incomparably greater and more significant, which is why it will be stable and happy. And don't think that only the young can enter into such a union. My colleague's example proves that this is accessible to people of any age. Such a union is possible only if they can understand the significance of what Anastasia set forth."</p><p>
"So what happens then? All those who have a marriage registration stamp in their passport aren't in fact married people?"</p><p>
"A passport stamp is nothing but a convention invented by society. Documents and all the various rituals among different peoples at different times have differed outwardly, but their essence is the same: to influence the psyche, to attempt by artificial means to create at least the semblance of the union of two people. Anastasia notes this exactly in talking about it: 'A false union is terrible. The children! Understand, Vladimir, the children! They sense the artificiality and falseness of that kind of union. The children come to doubt everything their parents say. The children subconsciously sense the lie in their conception, and this makes them feel bad.'</p><p>
</p><p>"There turns out to exist in nature not an artificial union, but a natural, divine union. Today, people have been shown how to achieve it."</p><p>
"That means even married people, meaning people with the passport stamp, should basically enter into marriage with their spouse again?"</p><p>
"It would be more accurate to say 'for real' rather than 'again.'"</p><p>
"This is going to be hard for many people to understand. In all countries, people are used to the idea that sex is the supreme pleasure, and they engage in it over and over for pleasure's sake."</p><p>
"It's all a lie, Vladimir Nikolaevich. Ninety percent of men are incapable of satisfying women.</p><p>
"The myth that many people achieve supreme pleasure from sex is nothing more than a psychological suggestion. Man's sexual attractions are exploited by commercial interests. The mass of legal and underground porn magazines mean money streams. They are pulling the wool over people's eyes. The movies in which supermen of all stripes fully satisfying their various partners are a business, too.</p><p>
"We're simply afraid, embarrassed to admit to each other that we don't have suitable partners. But the indisputable fact remains. Sixty percent of marital unions fall apart. The remaining forty percent of families are far from perfect. The constant spousal infidelities and the flourishing of prostitution attest to this.</p><p>
"The pleasure we experience today from sex is far from full or satisfactory. It is merely a small part of the pleasure accessible to man from the genuine co-creation by two people of the divine purpose we search for in vain all our lives.</p><p>
"'We're looking in the wrong place.' Life itself indisputably confirms the truth of her statements.</p><p>
</p><p>"Anastasia—the representative of a culture of some very ancient civilization of which our historians probably have no notion—is destroying stereotypes. The perfection of this culture can also be judged by its attitude toward the pregnant woman.</p><p>
"An essential condition of this culture is the fact that the pregnant woman should spend the nine months where she conceived and give birth there."</p><p>
"How important is this?"</p><p>
"With the help of information at the disposal of modern science and comparative analysis, we can prove the advantage of this assertion. The place where the conception and bringing to term by the mother of her future child is supposed to take place is called the homestead. On it, the man and woman have made a garden with all kinds of plants with their own hands. Physiologists would not deny the importance of correct nourishment for the pregnant woman. Many scientific and popular scientific works have been written about this. And so? Must every pregnant woman study them? Forget everything and intensively study the literature on what food to grow and how to cook it? That's hard to imagine.</p><p>
"Even if every pregnant woman did study these treatises, she would inevitably be faced with another insoluble problem: where to get the recommended food.</p><p>
"Let's imagine a very rich modern couple. They have the material resources to buy anything they like. An illusion! There is not and cannot be the money to allow a pregnant woman to buy what she wants precisely when she wants it. I mean that no money will buy, for instance, an apple close in quality to the apple a woman picks from the apple tree in her own orchard and uses for food then and there.</p><p>
"Next comes the psychological aspect, which is no less important than the physiological one. Let us imagine and compare two situations.</p><p>
"First is the standard one that occurs to most people. Let's take a young family with average or slightly above average wealth. The pregnant woman lives in an apartment with her husband. Can she feed herself sufficiently high-quality food? No! Modern supermarkets, even expensive ones, cannot offer us high-quality food. Preserved and frozen foods are unnatural for man. The farmers markets? Even there the food is of dubious quality, to put it mildly. Even private farmers have learned to use all kinds of chemical additives in growing food. When they grow it for themselves, it's one thing, but when it's for sale, then the desire for income pushes them to use stimulants. Everyone understands this, and naturally alarm arises at accepting food of unknown origin.</p><p>
"Alarm! It is modern man's constant companion.</p><p>
"The pregnant woman is inundated by an endless stream of information about constant social cataclysms and ecological disasters. Alarm mounts in her consciousness and subconscious over her future child's fate. Where are the positive factors? There simply cannot be any in the monstrous conditions of the daily life we have doomed ourselves to.</p><p>
"Even in a well-furnished apartment, we are used to the situation, and our surroundings have become stale to us. We are also used to the fact that all the things in the apartment get old and break, just as we are used to tap water unfit to drink. But the pregnant woman suddenly begins to sense all this clearly. She has no choice left but to rely on chance. This is the only thing she can count on when she is under the pressure of despair.</p><p>
"In the second instance, the woman, surrounded by a dimension of Love, as Anastasia calls it, besides satisfying her physiological needs, receives very powerful psychological nourishment.</p><p>
"Modern science can clarify and prove the accuracy of nearly all Anastasia's assertions. They are quite simple and logical. One can only wonder why we, delivering so many abstruse speeches, have not focused our attention on them.</p><p>
"However, Anastasia also talks about phenomena inexplicable to modern science.</p><p>
"'Parents should present the three main points, the three first planes of being, to their co-creation.'</p><p>
"She goes on to say that in order for the three mysterious points of being to merge into one in one place–specifically, the homestead–the following must occur: 'First, the thoughts of the two people in love must merge into one. . . . This is the first point, and it is called the parental idea. The second point, or rather, another human plane is born and lights a new star in the sky, when in love and in thoughts of beautiful creation, two bodies merge into one.. . . And the third point—the new plane must be achieved in that place, the place where the child was conceived and where the birth should take place as well. The father should be by her side. And the great Father who loves us all will raise a crown over the three.'</p><p>
</p><p>"Undoubtedly, the advantages of conceiving, carrying to term, and bearing a child in the same place—a beautiful homestead—can be scientifically proven by both physiologists and psychologists. However, Anastasia talks about something greater. She says that in this instance a full connection is made between the person born and the Cosmos. Why? At what expense? How important for the future person's fate is this approach to his birth? Modern scientists can only conjecture.</p><p>
"I have attempted to compare what Anastasia said to what the horoscopes popular now predict. In and of itself, the question arises as to exactly which of the three instants can be considered the most important for a person's birth: the idea, the physical conception, or the appearance in the world of the infant from his mother's womb?</p><p>
"The person's generally accepted birth date is usually considered the moment when the infant emerges from its mother's womb. Horoscopes are calculated from this moment. But science now knows that the fruit, while still in the mother, already lives and feels. If this is so, then the person already exists. He is already born. He moves and the mother feels the kicks of his little legs and arms. Might a more precise birth date for a person be the moment the spermatozoa fertilizes the ovum? From the standpoint of physiology, this moment determines a person's birth date the most accurately. However, the meeting of spermatozoa and ovum is an effect, not a cause. It is preceded by the intentions of two people. Might those be the determinant of the birth date? Of the three points, it is usual today to consider the birth date to be the moment the fruit appears in the world. Tomorrow, something else may be generally accepted. According to Anastasia's theory, a person's birth date is the moment all three components, all the above-listed moments, merge into one, and this has its own indisputable logic. However, we–and by this I mean both modern science and religious teachings–are afraid to even mention this."</p><p>
"What's there to be afraid of here?"</p><p>
"There is something to be afraid of. . . .You see, Vladimir Nikolaevich, if we admit the indisputability of Anastasia's assertion, then we immediately must admit that in comparison with the people of the culture she represents, we are not full-fledged human beings. Most modern people would lack one or two components inherent in the full-fledged human being. This is why we're afraid to think, let alone speak about this. But we should give it thought."</p><p>
"But might the reason we don't speak or think about it be that these assertions are too debatable?"</p><p>
"Just the opposite! They are too indisputable!</p><p>
"First. Think about it. Who would deny that a situation free of depravity and full of the thought of the future child precedes the meeting of spermatozoa and ovum is the most moral and psychologically replete situation?</p><p>
"Second. Also absolutely indisputable is the fact that the pregnant woman should get complete nourishment and avoid stress. Her own homestead, such as Anastasia speaks about, is ideal for this.</p><p>
"Third. Birth in a familiar situation, in an accustomed environment, is going to be more favorable for the birthing mother and, above all, the newborn. This, too, is an indisputable fact for psychologists and physiologists as well. Do you agree with each of these three points?"</p><p>
"Of course, I do."</p><p>
"There, you see? They're indisputable, and not only for scientists. Consequently, we cannot deny the positive impact from the merging of these three positive components into a single whole.</p><p>
"As a psychologist, I can assume that this merging in space will result in a psychological reaction. The entire dimension of the Universe reacts to it. It receives the newborn and establishes an information connection with him."</p><p>
"Possibly. But what significance does the accuracy of determining a person's birth date have in this?"</p><p>
"Enormous significance! Global significance! It determines the level of our own worldview. If we place the fruit's appearance in the world first, then, consequently, matter is primary in our worldview.</p><p>
"If we put the moment of merging of the thoughts of the man and woman first, then consciousness is primary. Consequently, different cultures defining the way of life are shaped. In the first instance, preference is given to matter; in the second, spirituality. An open and hidden dispute has been going on about this for a long time. Now, however, I see the dispute's entire pointlessness. Anastasia talks about the merging into one not only of these two concepts, but of a third as well. Based on her assertions, I can construct a theory about the birth of a full-fledged human being, as well as the possibility of it being realized. This is simple and accessible for every person. But why don't we realize our possibilities? Why is there chaos in our consciousness? Why does life pass in turmoil? That is the question."</p><p>
"Here is what I think. The date of birth can still be considered to be the day and hour when the infant appeared in the world from his mother's womb. Only it should be referred to more accurately as the hour of appearance in the world."</p><p>
"Possibly. Quite possibly! But you must still ask Anastasia about the moment of birth."</p><p>
"I will. Even I am curious to find out when specifically I was born and when my son was born."</p><p>
"Your son. . . . You came to me for advice, and I went on about my own thoughts. Forgive me for getting carried away. It's been a burning issue. You understand, I see patients three times a week. People come to me with their problems.</p><p>
"They all have the standard questions: how to raise a child; how to make contact with a son or daughter. And the child is already five, ten, even fifteen years old.</p><p>
"Telling someone, 'It's a little late to be raising them, papa,' means killing their last hope. So I have to engage in consolation, basically."</p><p>
"My son will be five years old soon as well. You mean I'm too late, too?"</p><p>
"Your situation is different, Vladimir Nikolaevich. Anastasia is by your son's side. She had good reason for not letting you throw your child into the daily life of our world. She is raising him in accordance with a different culture."</p><p>
"Does that mean my son and I are people of different cultures, and consequently we will never understand one another?"</p><p>
"Parents and children are always representatives of seemingly different cultures, different worldviews. Each generation has its own priorities. True, the difference is not as striking as in your case. My advice is to you is before interacting with your son, consult with Anastasia as to how best to do that. Pay close attention to what she says. You've read and thought a lot about raising children. Now it will be easier for you to understand her."</p><p>
"I don't always manage to understand her, even after a long period of time. Some of her statements raise doubts. They're mystical and unsubstantiated. Much of what Anastasia has said I have tried not to publish at all because it is often more like science fiction and—"</p><p>
Alexander Sergeyevich suddenly slapped his desk and abruptly, even rather rudely, interrupted me.</p><p>
"You have no right to act in this way. If your mind does not allow you to comprehend something, give others the opportunity to do so."</p><p>
I did not like the harshness of the psychologist's tone or the implication of what he said. This was not the first time I had heard or read similar statements addressed to me. They implied that I was some kind of halfwit and my role was merely to compile everything the taiga hermit said for more accurate exposition. But the clever people making these kinds of statements were not taking everything into account. I decided to put the psychologist, who had suddenly become aggressive, in his place.</p><p>
"Of course, you consider yourself one of those others capable of understanding everything she's said. I'm not a psychologist with an academic degree but even I understand a simple truth. If I were to publish all of her unsubstantiated, mystical statements, then everything written in the books as a whole would be treated like a fairy tale. And everything rational that can be applied to life today would be buried. By not publishing certain mystical statements I may thereby be saving what is rational."</p><p>
"But can you say more specifically what kind of mysticism we're talking about?"</p><p>
"Yes, take this for example. She said that she had gathered from the Universe the best combinations of sounds and hidden them in the text of the book and they would have a favorable effect on readers."</p><p>
"Yes, I remember that. I remember it well. It was written back in the first book. It says there that the impact will increase if the reader is listening to the natural sounds of nature while reading."</p><p>
"So you remember? And the fact that these words will resound not only in the text of the book itself but will be placed on the inside cover. Do you remember? The publishers advised me to do that to intrigue readers, so I did."</p><p>
"And rightly so."</p><p>
"Rightly? And do you know that this statement on the cover drove many away from the book? Many considered it a publicity ploy, and the press wrote about that. I took it off the cover in some editions. Many people consider it mystical, fictitious."</p><p>
"Idiots! Can society's reason really have atrophied to that extent? Or has intellectual laziness turned off the masses' logical thinking?"</p><p>
"What does laziness of the mind have to do with this, if it can't be proved?"</p><p>
"Proved? What is there to prove here? This statement is nothing less than a psychological test, brilliant in its simplicity and efficiency, which in one instant determines without ceremony who are the total jerks with atrophied intellectual capabilities. If they also speak out in the press, they are thereby saying, 'Look, everyone, at what jerks we are.' A brilliant test!"</p><p>
"What does a test have to do with this? This statement is unsubstantiated."</p><p>
"Unsubstantiated, you think? There is nothing here to prove. What Anastasia has said is an axiom. Judge for yourself. The texts of any book—note this, any book—any letter, any spoken speech, consists of a combination of sounds. Is this understandable? Do you agree with this?"</p><p>
"Well, basically, yes, I do. Indeed, the texts of all books consist of combinations. . . ."</p><p>
"Do you see how simple it all is? And those too lazy to think logically have stumbled over this simplicity."</p><p>
"Possibly. But she did say that she had found and gathered from the expanses of the Universe the best combinations, and that they would have a beneficial impact on readers."</p><p>
"But there is absolutely nothing mystical in this. Judge for yourself. When you read a given book or newspaper or magazine article, doesn't it have an impact on you? The text might leave you indifferent or give rise to irritation, pleasure, anger, or delight. Right? Do you see? Do you agree?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"That's good. As for the beneficial impact of Anastasia's texts, that has been proved by the way readers have reacted to what they've read. We're not talking about reviews, which can be bought. The fact of their beneficial impact is confirmed by the creative surge. This is attested to by the many poems and songs written by your readers. I've bought five audio collections of songs dedicated to Anastasia. They were written by simple people–or maybe, on the contrary, anything but simple people. I bought these cassettes and listened to them. Life itself has confirmed what Anastasia has said. After all, the poems were born under the influence of what had been read. And you say it's 'mysticism.' You don't have the right to be Anastasia's censor."</p><p>
"Fine. Farewell. Thank you for the advice."</p><p>
I had already taken hold of the door handle to leave the psychologist's office.</p><p>
"Wait a minute, please, Vladimir Nikolaevich. I see you've taken offense at me. Forgive me if my tone was rather harsh. I don't want our parting to be like this."</p><p>
Alexander Sergeyevich was standing in the middle of the office, a slightly stout, elderly man. He neatly buttoned his jacket and continued.</p><p>
"You must understand, you are obliged to write everything Anastasia says. Even if you don't understand some of it, let me or someone else try. Let us. It is important for them to understand!"</p><p>
"Who are 'they'?"</p><p>
"The young women still able to give birth to healthy children. If they understand, everything will have to change. . . . But we spoke rather little about your son, and that is exactly why you came to see me."</p><p>
"Of course, that is why I came."</p><p>
"I cannot give you any concrete advice. The situation is too unusual. You might bring some pictures with you to the taiga for him. On history, for example. And dress a little better. I may be saying something stupid, but I just would like you to present our reality to him as not too harsh."</p><p>
"How should I present it? Slick and prettified?"</p><p>
"That's not the point. You yourself will appear before your son as a representative of our reality and would thereby be compromising yourself before your child."</p><p>
"But why is it that I alone must answer for all the depravities of our society?"</p><p>
"If you show your son your inability to change anything in society for the better, then you will be showing him your impotence. You will be compromising yourself before your son. I think he has been raised in such a way that he doesn't understand the existence of anything impossible for man."</p><p>
"You appear to be right, Alexander Sergeyevich. Thank you for the practical advice. Indeed, it is better to prettify our life a little for the child. Exactly, it's worth it, or else he'll think . . ."</p><p>
We shook hands and, it seemed to me, parted without animosity.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0602>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>2. The Conversation with my Son</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div>
</p><p>
Having made the entire journey by myself from the river to Anastasia's glade, I approached the familiar places with the feeling that I had come home. This time no one met me. I actually liked walking through the taiga on my own, without a guide.</p><p>
I didn't shout or call out to Anastasia; she might be busy with her own affairs. She would get free, sense I'd arrived, and come herself.</p><p>
When I saw my favorite spot on the shore of the lake, where Anastasia and I had sat so often, I first decided to change clothes before sitting down and resting after the road.</p><p>
I took my dark gray, wrinkle-proof suit, thin white sweater, and new shoes out of my backpack. When I'd been preparing for the journey, I'd also wanted to take a white shirt and tie, but then I decided the shirt would wrinkle and you couldn't iron it in the taiga. But they packed the suit for me at the store so that it would look neat and pressed.</p><p>
I decided to appear before my son looking elegant and formal, which is why I spent so much time and thought into my outward appearance.</p><p>
I even brought my mechanical razor and a mirror. I propped the mirror up on a tree, shaved, and combed my hair. Then I sat down on a small mound and took out a notebook and pen in order to add to my plan for meeting my son what I had thought about on the way.</p><p>
My son would soon be five years old. Naturally, he could already speak. The last time I saw him he was very small and couldn't talk yet, but now he probably could make sense of a lot. He probably babbled with Anastasia and his grandfathers for days on end. I made a firm decision to tell Anastasia, as soon as I saw her, how I'd been planning my meeting with my son and what I intended to say to him.</p><p>
For five years I had been painstakingly studying systems for raising children, and I had taken what in my view was all the best and most comprehensible from that. I had drawn my conclusions from talking with pedagogues and child psychologists. Now, before meeting my son, I wanted to discuss with Anastasia my conclusions and the plan I'd developed. I wanted to think it all through in detail with her. Let Anastasia advise me as to what first words I should say to my son and what pose I should stand in while doing so. The pose was important, too, I decided; a father ought to appear important to his child. But first Anastasia had to introduce me to him.</p><p>
The first point written down in my notebook: "Anastasia introduces me to my son."</p><p>
She could introduce me in simple words, like, "Here, son, before you stands your father."</p><p>
She had to say these words very formally, so that the child at once sensed from her tone the importance of his father and would then listen to him.</p><p>
Suddenly I felt everything around me fall still, as if on its guard. The sudden silence didn't frighten me. This always happened before meeting Anastasia in the taiga. The taiga and all its inhabitants seemed to hold their breath, listening, alert, trying to assess whether the newcomer was going to bring their mistress any unpleasantness. Then everything would calm down if it sensed the absence of aggression.</p><p>
From the silence I also realized that Anastasia had quietly walked up behind me. It wasn't hard to sense her because behind me it was as if something had begun warming my back, and only Anastasia could look with a warming gaze. But I did not turn around immediately. For a while I continued sitting, sensing the pleasant and joyful warmth. Then I turned around and saw . . .</p><p>
Before me, standing firmly in the grass in bare feet, was my little son. He had grown up. His dark blond hair already fell to his shoulders in curls. He was wearing a short, collarless shirt woven of nettle fiber. He looked like Anastasia and maybe me a little bit, but you couldn't tell right away. When I turned around, my hands resting on the ground, I saw him and froze on all fours, forgetting everything in the world. He looked at me in silence with Anastasia's gaze. I might not have been able to say anything for a long time, I was so surprised, but he spoke first.</p><p>
"Greetings to your light thoughts, my papa!"</p><p>
"Yes? And greetings to you, too, of course," I replied.</p><p>
"You have to forgive me, papa."</p><p>
"Forgive you for what?"</p><p>
"For interrupting your important thoughts. At first I was standing farther away from you and not bothering you, but I wanted to come closer and be near. Let me sit quietly next to you, Papa, while you finish your thoughts."</p><p>
"Yes? All right. Of course, sit."</p><p>
He walked up quickly, sat down half a meter away from me, and fell still. In my confusion, I continued standing on all fours, but while he was taking a seat I managed to think, "I should adopt a profound pose while my important thoughts, as he believes, are concluding, and determine how best to behave from now on."</p><p>
I adopted a dignified pose, and for a while we sat side by side in silence. Then I turned to my small son sitting quietly by my side and asked him, "Well, how are things going here for you?"</p><p>
He stirred joyously at the sound of my voice, turned, and began looking right in my eyes. From his gaze I could sense that he was excited but didn't know how to answer my simple question. Then he started speaking anyway.</p><p>
"Papa, I can't answer your question. I don't know how things are going. Here, Papa, it's life. It's a good life."</p><p>
"I have to continue the conversation somehow," I thought. "I can't let the initiative slip." I asked him another standard question.</p><p>
"Well, and how have you been here? Do you listen to your mother?"</p><p>
This time he answered right away.</p><p>
"I'm always happy to listen when Mama talks. And it's interesting to listen when my grandfathers talk, too. I talk to them, too, and they listen to me. But Mama Anastasia thinks I talk a lot and I should think more, that's what Mama Anastasia says. But my thinking is fast and I want to say everything differently."</p><p>
"Differently? How's that?"</p><p>
"Like my grandfathers put words together one after the other, like Mama, like you, Papa."</p><p>
"How do you know how I put words together?"</p><p>
"Mama showed me. When Mama starts talking with your words, it's very interesting for me."</p><p>
"Yes? That's wonderful. . . . So what do you want to be?"</p><p>
Once again, he didn't understand this very ordinary question that adults often ask children, and he replied after a brief pause:</p><p>
"But I already am, Papa."</p><p>
"I understand that, but I mean, what do you want to become. When you grow up, what will you be?"</p><p>
"When I grow up I'll be you, Papa. I'll finish doing what you're doing now."</p><p>
"How do you know what I'm doing?"</p><p>
"Mama Anastasia told me."</p><p>
"And what has she told you about me?"</p><p>
"A lot. Mama Anastasia tells me what a . . . what's that word . . . yes, I remember, what a hero you are, my papa."</p><p>
"A hero?"</p><p>
"Yes. It's hard for you. Mama wants it to be easier for you, so that you can relax in humane conditions, but you go where lots of people have a hard time living. You go so it will be good there. I was very sad to find out that there are people who don't have their own glade and they're always being scared and forced to live differently from how they really want. They can't pick their own food. They have to . . . yes, work, that's what it's called. They have to do things the way someone tells them, not how they want. But they get pieces of paper for that, money, and then they exchange that money for food. They've just forgotten a little how you can live differently and how you can be happy about life. And you go where it's hard for people, Papa, to make it better for them."</p><p>
"Yes? I do go. It should be nice everywhere. But how do you plan to finish doing good, how are you preparing for that now? You have to study."</p><p>
"I am studying, Papa. I like studying a lot, and I'm trying."</p><p>
"What are you studying, what subject?"</p><p>
Once again, he did not understand the question right away, but then he replied.</p><p>
"I'm studying the whole subject. As soon as I catch up and am as fast as Mama Anastasia, I'll understand the whole subject right away and all the subjects. Yes, it would be more correct to say all the subjects."</p><p>
"Who are you going to catch up to like your mama?"</p><p>
"My thought. But right now it's not getting caught up to as fast. The speed of mama's thought is faster. It's faster than grandfathers' and a sunbeam. It's so fast, only His is faster."</p><p>
"Whose is that?"</p><p>
"God's—our Father's."</p><p>
"Yes. Of course. Well, you try hard. Yes, you must try hard, my son."</p><p>
"All right, Papa. I'll try even harder."</p><p>
In order to continue this discussion of studies but say something intelligent and significant, I randomly took out one of the books I'd brought. It was a fifth-grade textbook, History of the Ancient World, and I said to my son, "Here, you see, Volodya? This is one of the many books written by modern people. This book tells children about how life sprang up on Earth and how man and society have developed. There are lots of color pictures here and printed text. This book sets forth the history of humanity. Scholars—these are wise people, maybe smarter than others—have described in this book the lives of the original people on Earth. When you learn to read, you can learn a lot of interesting things from books."</p><p>
"I can read, Papa."</p><p>
"Yes. . . . What? Mama is teaching you to read?"</p><p>
"One day Mama Anastasia drew the letters for me in the sand and told me their names."</p><p>
"And you remembered all the letters right away?"</p><p>
"Yes. There aren't very many of them. It made me sad to find out there were so few."</p><p>
At first I lent no significance to what he'd said about the number of letters. I wanted to hear whether my son really could read a printed text. Opening the book to the first page, I held it out to him and suggested, "Here, try to read a little."</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>A Distorted Notion of History</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>He took the opened book, with his left hand for some reason, and looked at the printed text for a while in silence, and then he began to read. "'Ancient people lived in hot countries, where there were no frosts or cold winters. People did not live alone but in groups, which scientists call human herds. Everyone in the herd, from little to big, was engaged in gathering. For days on end, they searched for edible roots, wild fruits and berries, and bird eggs.'"</p><p>
After reading this text, he raised his little head from the book and looked straight into my eyes seemingly with a question. I was silent, not understanding what bothered him. Volodya began talking somewhat anxiously.</p><p>
"The picture isn't happening in me, Papa."</p><p>
"What picture?"</p><p>
"There's no picture happening. Either it broke or it can't picture what's written in this book. When Mama Anastasia or my grandfathers talk, I can picture everything clearly. When I read His book, I can picture everything even more clearly. But what's written in this book makes a distorted picture. Or it's broken in me."</p><p>
"But why do you need to picture it? Why waste time on pictures?"</p><p>
"Well, the pictures come by themselves when the truth . . . but now they aren't, which means . . . Just a minute and I'll try to make certain about this. Maybe the people written about in the book looked for food all day because they didn't have any eyes. Why did they look for food all day if it's always right there?"</p><p>
And then something incomprehensible began to happen to the child. Suddenly he scrunched up his eyes and started feeling the grass around him with one hand. He found something, picked it, and ate it. Then he got up on his little legs without opening his eyes and said, "Maybe they don't have a nose either." He squeezed his nostrils and walked away from me. After walking about fifteen meters without letting go of his nose, he lay down in the grass and let out a sound that resembled "a-a."</p><p>
And right then everything around him seemed to go into motion. Several squirrels leapt from the trees onto the ground. They leapt to the grass, spreading their paws and fluffing their tails out like parachutes, they ran toward the child lying on the grass, placed something next to his head, leapt across the grass toward the trees, climbed them, and parachuted back down to the ground.</p><p>
Three wolves standing a little ways away also ran up to the child lying in the grass and began to mark time next to him uneasily.</p><p>
There was the crack of twigs, and from the bushes, toddling in haste, appeared a young bear, and then another that was smaller but nimbler.</p><p>
The first bear sniffed the child's head and licked his hand, which was still squeezing his nose. Various taiga animals, big and little, continued appearing from the bushes. They all marked time uneasily around the little person lying in the grass, paying absolutely no attention to each other. They obviously didn't understand what was happening to him.</p><p>
I, too, at first couldn't understand my son's strange actions. Then I guessed. He was depicting a helpless person deprived of sight and smell. The "a-a" sound he made from time to time told those around him that he was hungry.</p><p>
The squirrels kept running up and back, bringing cedar nuts, dried mushrooms, and something else and piling them next to the child lying in the grass.</p><p>
One squirrel stood on its hind legs, holding a cedar cone in its front paws, and quickly began getting the nuts out of it with its teeth. Another squirrel bit the nuts open and made a pile of the shelled kernels.</p><p>
But the person didn't take the food. He continued to lie with closed eyes and squeezed nose, making his "a-a" sound more and more insistently.</p><p>
A sable dashed out of the bushes. A handsome, fluffy little beast with shimmering fur. It made two circles around the child lying in the grass. It ran, paying no attention to the assembled beasts. And the beasts, whose attention was wholly consumed by the child's unusual behavior alone, seemed not to notice the sable. But when it came to an abrupt halt by the pile of cedar nuts shelled by the squirrels and started eating them, the beasts reacted to that. The wolves were the first to bare their teeth, and their fur stood on end. The bear, which was shifting back and forth from paw to paw, first fell still, stared at the eater, and then slapped it on its side. The sable flew off to the side and did a somersault but immediately jumped up, nimbly ran to the recumbent child, and placed its front paws on his chest. As soon as the boy attempted to pronounce his next insistent "a-a," the sable immediately came close to his little open mouth and obviously put chewed food in it.</p><p>
Finally, Volodya sat up in the grass, opened his eyes, and let go of his nose. He looked around at all the agitated beasts, got on his feet, and started reassuring them.</p><p>
The beasts approached the boy in order, according to some hierarchy known only to them. Each received its reward. The wolves, a pat on the withers; Volodya patted one bear's snout with both hands, and for some reason rubbed the other on the nose. He lightly held down the sable spinning at his foot and when it turned over on its back, scratched its belly.</p><p>
Each beast, after getting its reward, immediately made a tactful retreat.</p><p>
Volodya took a handful of shelled cedar nuts from the grass and made a sign to the squirrels that evidently meant it was time to stop their offerings. Although the child did reassure the beasts, until then they continued feeding him and then immediately stopped.</p><p>
My little son walked over to me, held out a handful of nuts, and said, "In the picture happening inside me, Papa, the first people who started living on Earth didn't have to spend entire days gathering food for themselves. They didn't think about food at all. Forgive me, Papa. My picture isn't like what smart scholars wrote in the book you brought."</p><p>
"Yes. I realize it is all wrong."</p><p>
I sat back down on the mound, and Volodya, seating himself right next to me, asked, "But why are they different—my picture and the picture that comes from what's written in the book?"</p><p>
My thought, too, must have started working faster than ever before. Indeed, why was this abracadabra written in the book, a textbook for children? Even a grown person not very familiar with wild nature understands that in a warm climate, especially a tropical one, there is plenty of food. So much of it that even enormous animals—mammoths and elephants—freely found nourishment for themselves. The small beasts didn't go hungry either. And among them, man, the most developed creature in the intellectual sense, had trouble finding himself food. This truly is simply impossible to picture. It turns out that most of the people who study history plain and simple do not think about the meaning of what is written in history books. They don't compare what they've read with the most elementary logic but perceive the historical past as it is offered up to them.</p><p>
For instance, tell a summer person who has a plot of just six hundred square meters that his neighbor spends all day amid the food growing on it and can't find anything to eat for himself. The summer person will think of his neighbor as someone sick, to put it mildly.</p><p>
A child who has grown up in the taiga and tasted the different plants and fruits could not imagine why they needed to search if it was always nearby. In addition, the animals surrounding them were prepared at any moment to serve them, freeing them from the need to climb a tree for nuts or even to shell them.</p><p>
Previously, I had observed one other phenomenon. All the female beasts living on the territory of Anastasia's family perceived the infant she gave birth to as their own. I am not the only person who has described this phenomenon. We know of many instances when animals nursed a human offspring. Many have also observed, probably, a dog nursing a kitten. The kitten is the dog's pup. But animals have a special attitude toward man.</p><p>
The beasts in the taiga always mark their territory. Anastasia's family lives on territory they've marked and therefore there is a special attitude toward them as well. Why are all the beasts so drawn to man and prepared to serve him with enormous, anxious desire? Why does each of them need man's caress? Even different animals in a house or a modern apartment—a cat, a dog, a parrot—strive to get at least some attention from man and, as the highest reward, a caress. Each even becomes jealous when man pays more attention to one of the other domestic animals. We think this is ordinary and usual. Here, in the taiga, this looks a little unusual, but in fact it is the same unique phenomenon: all animals strive to obtain the beneficial, invisible light that comes from man, or his emotions, or some other emanation. It doesn't matter what you call this indisputable fact. What does matter is something else: it exists in nature and we have to know exactly why. Was this there originally, or did man tame the animals over the centuries? He may have tamed absolutely all of them. After all, even today, on all the continents, many different animals and birds serve man. They know their master. Elephants and monkeys in India, camels and donkeys in Central Asia. Almost everywhere there are dogs, cats, cows, horses, hens, geese, falcons, and dolphins. It's difficult to list them all. The main point lies elsewhere: they serve, and this phenomenon is known to nearly everyone. But when did this begin? Three thousand years ago? Five? Ten? Or maybe this was conceived by the Creator right away, back when nature was being created. Probably it was right away. Here it says in the Bible, "Determine the predestination of every creature." If this was conceived of and implemented right away, then man truly could not have had problems obtaining food.</p><p>
Why then do the history books for children and adults say the exact opposite, and not only in our own country? All over the world this absurd notion is instilled in people. A mistake? Probably not. There is something behind this that is more significant than a simple mistake. There is intent. Someone needs this very badly. Who? Why? What if it were written differently? What if the truth were written, if all over the world textbooks said, for example, "The first people who lived on our Earth experienced no problems whatsoever with nourishment. They were surrounded by a great diversity of first-class and healthful food." Then the question would arise in many human minds, "Where did this diversity and abundance go? Why must man today work for someone like a slave for a piece of bread?" Above all, the following question might arise: "How irreproachable is human society's present-day path of development?"</p><p>
How was I to respond now to my son as to why something so absurd was written in this "smart" book, this textbook? People in the tropics spent days on end searching for food? He, living in the taiga among beasts devoted to him, could not picture what the "smart people" wrote.</p><p>
I recalled Anastasia's words: "You have to perceive reality yourself." After attempting to untangle this situation, I said to my son, "This book is complicated. You have to use your imagination to verify everything written here. Why write something you can picture so clearly? And here they write the opposite. So that you can verify with your own pictures where the truth lies and where the opposite. You have to be very attentive. Volodya, do you understand me?"</p><p>
</p><p>
"I'll try to understand why they write an untruth, Papa. But right now I don't. Some beasts erase their tracks with their tail. Others build false burrows, and there even some that make traps. Only why do people need all kinds of traps?"</p><p>
"I'm telling you, in order to develop."</p><p>
"But can't you develop by the truth?"</p><p>
"Yes you can, but not the same way."</p><p>
"Where you live, Papa, do people develop by the truth or untruth?"</p><p>
"All kinds of ways. People try to achieve effectiveness in their development by the truth and untruth. Do you read books often, Volodya?"</p><p>
"Every day."</p><p>
"What kind? Who gives them to you?"</p><p>
"Mama Anastasia gave me all the books you wrote to read, Papa. I read them very fast. But every day I read different books. The ones that have different cheerful letters."</p><p>
At first I didn't even pay any attention to what he said about strange books with different cheerful letters.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>You Loved Mama but Didn't Recognize Your Love</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>A terrible conjecture rushed through my mind. "If my son has read all my books, then he is perfectly well informed about my attitude toward Anastasia during the first few days I knew her. He knows the names I called her and even that I wanted to beat her with a stick. What child, loving his mother, can forgive that kind of loutish attitude toward her? Undoubtedly, each time he recalls what he's read, my son will think ill of me. Why did she let him read the books I wrote? It would be better if he couldn't read at all. Or could she have guessed to tear out of the books the pages where I talk about my unseemly behavior? Clutching to that hope, I cautiously asked, "So, Volodya, you've read all the books I wrote?"</p><p>
"Yes, I have, Papa."</p><p>
"And you understood everything written in them?"</p><p>
"Not everything, but Mama Anastasia explained how I should understand what I didn't, so I did."</p><p>
"What did she explain to you? Can you give an example of what you didn't understand?"</p><p>
"Yes. I didn't understand right away why you were angry at Mama Anastasia and wanted to hit her. She is very good, kind, and beautiful. She loves you. But you didn't love her at all if you shouted at her. But then Mama told me everything."</p><p>
"What? What did she tell you?"</p><p>
"Mama Anastasia explained how much you loved her but didn't recognize your love. Even so, when you went back to where it's hard for people to live, you started doing what Mama asked you to do. She says you did everything your own way, Papa, the way you thought best. But when you remembered Mama, you wrote a book that people liked. People started writing poems and songs. People started thinking and doing good things. There are more and more of them now—people thinking about what is good. That means there can be goodness all over the Earth. People even shouted at you for your book and envied you. But you wrote another book, Papa, and then another and another. Some people started shouting at you harder. But others, when you went to see them, clapped for you, they understood what was written in the books. They felt that the energy of Love, which you still hadn't recognized, was helping you write these books. And I was born because you wanted to see me very much, and Love wanted you to. Papa, you wrote the books because the world wanted to prepare something good for my birth. Only you couldn't get quite everything ready before I was born. Because the world is very big. Mama Anastasia said I have to be worthy of you and the world. I have to grow up and understand everything. Mama also said she was never angry at you. She immediately recognized the energy of Love. Then Mama Anastasia read you a book written in unsad letters. She didn't read you the whole book. But what she did read you were able to read in letters lots of people understand. And almost everything came out right for you."</p><p>
"What book? You say your mama read it to you? What is it called?"</p><p>
"It's called 'Co-Creation.'"</p><p>
"'Co-Creation'?"</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Book of the Primary Sources</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"Yes, 'Co-Creation.' And I like to read it every day. Only not in your letters, Papa. Mama taught me to read that book in other letters. I like different cheerful letters. You can read it your whole life. It talks about everything. And soon there will be a new book on Earth. And you, my papa, will describe the new book."</p><p>
"Volodya, you said that the wrong way. You need to say 'write.'"</p><p>
"But you aren't going to write your ninth book, Papa. It's going to be created by lots of adults and children. It's going to be alive. Made up of lots of beautiful chapters—paradise homesteads. People will write this book on Earth in their Father's cheerful letters. It will be eternal. Mama taught me to read those living and eternal letters and to make words from them."</p><p>
"Wait a minute," I interrupted my son. "I have to think for a moment."</p><p>
He immediately fell into an obedient silence.</p><p>
"Incredible," I thought. "This means that somewhere here, in the taiga, Anastasia has a very ancient book written in letters people don't know. She knows these letters and has taught our son to make words from them and read them. She has read me chapters for 'Co-Creation' from this book. Chapters about how God created the Earth and man, and I wrote them down. That's how it happened, according to what my son said. But I never saw Anastasia pick up any book. But my son said that she translated the letters of this book for me. I have to try to clarify everything through my son."</p><p>
And I asked him, "Volodya, do you know that there are many languages in the world? For example, English, German, Russian, French, and many others?"</p><p>
"Yes, I do."</p><p>
"What language is the book your mama can read, and you, too, written in?"</p><p>
"It's written in its own language, but you can say its letters in any language. And they're translated into the one you speak. Only not all the words can be translated because you don't have very many letters in your language, Papa."</p><p>
"Can you bring me the book with the different cheerful letters, as you put it?"</p><p>
"I can't bring you the whole book, Papa. I can only bring a few little letters. Only why bring them? It's better for them to stay in their place. If you want, Papa, I can read you the letters from here. Only I can't read as fast as Mama."</p><p>
"Read what you can."</p><p>
Volodya stood up and pointing into space, he started reading sentences from chapters in "Co-Creation":</p><p>
"The Universe manifests thought. A dream is born from thought. It is partially visible in matter. My son, you are infinite, you are eternal, your creative dreams are in you."</p><p>
He read syllable by syllable. I observed the expression on his face. It changed slightly at each syllable: from surprised, to attentive, to cheerful. But when I looked where he was pointing, I didn't see any letters, let alone syllables, in space, and so I interrupted my son's strange reading.</p><p>
"Wait a minute, Volodya. You mean you're seeing letters in space? But why don't I see them?"</p><p>
He looked at me in amazement. He thought for a while and then spoke uncertainly.</p><p>
"Papa, you mean you don't see the birch, pine, cedar, and ash?"</p><p>
"I see them, but where are the letters?"</p><p>
"Those are the letters our Creator writes in!"</p><p>
He went back to reading, syllable by syllable, pointing to different plants. And I understood something incredible. The entire taiga around the lake on the shores of which my son and I were sitting and where Anastasia had sat many times, was filled with plants. The name of each plant began with a certain letter, and some had several names. From name to name, letter to letter—and you had a syllable, then a word, then a sentence. Later I found out that the entire dimension of the taiga around Anastasia's glade is surrounded not simply with chaotically growing trees, bushes, and herbs. The enormous dimension around Anastasia's glade is written in truly living letters—the plants. You apparently could read this incredible book endlessly. If you read certain plant names from north to south, you got certain words and sentences. From west to east, different ones. Strictly along the circumference, still others. Words, sentences, and images were also formed from plant names following the course of the sun. The sun's rays passed over the letters like a pointer. I realized why Volodya called these letters cheerful. In ordinary books, all the printed letters strictly resemble one another. But in this case, the plant-letters, even the same plants, were always different. Illuminated by the sun at different angles, rustling their leaves, they welcomed man. You really could look at them endlessly.</p><p>
But who wrote this amazing book and when, over how many centuries? The generations of Anastasia's ancestors? Somebody else? I heard a brief and laconic answer from Anastasia: "The generations of my ancestors safeguarded the letters of this book for millennia in their original sequence."</p><p>
I looked at my son and feverishly searched for a topic of conversation that we could discuss and achieve complete mutual understanding.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>One Plus One Equals Three</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>Arithmetic! Mathematics! Of course, this kind of exact science could not give rise to any disagreements. If Anastasia taught her son to count, then the conversation on this subject would not conceal any contradictions or advantages. Two times two is always four, in any language and in all times. Cheered by my discovery, I asked hopefully:</p><p>
"Volodya, did your mama teach you how to count, add, and multiply?"</p><p>
"Yes, Papa."</p><p>
"That's good. Where I live, there is a science, mathematics. It has very great significance. A great deal is founded on computations and calculations. And to make it easier to add, subtract, and multiply, people have invented many devices without which it would be hard to get along now. I brought you one of them. It's called a calculator."</p><p>
I took out a small Japanese pocket calculator with a solar battery, turned it on, and showed my son.</p><p>
"See, Volodya, this small device can do a great deal. For instance, do you know what two times two is?"</p><p>
"Yes, Papa. Do you want me to say 'four'?"</p><p>
"Correct, four. But it's not a matter of me wanting this. That's what it is. Two times two will always be four. This small device can calculate, too. Look at the little screen. Here I'm pushing the 2 button and the figure 2 shines on the screen. Now I press the symbol for multiplication and the figure 2 again. Then I press the equal sign button to find out how much I get as a result. There you have it. The number 4 is lit up on the screen. But this is a very simple arithmetic operation. This little device can calculate in a way man can't. Here, for instance: Multiply 136 times 1136. Now I press the equal sign button and we find out how much that makes."</p><p>
"154,496," Volodya said, beating the calculator.</p><p>
Then I started multiplying and dividing by four-, five-, and six-digit numbers, but each time my son beat the calculator. He named the result immediately and without trying. The competition with the calculator resembled a game, but it didn't entertain my son at all. He was simply naming numbers while thinking his own thoughts.</p><p>
"How do you do that, Volodya?" I asked in amazement. "Who taught you to calculate so quickly in your head?"</p><p>
"I'm not calculating, Papa."</p><p>
"How's that, you're not calculating? Your naming numbers, answering questions."</p><p>
"I'm just naming numbers because they're always unchanging in the dead dimension."</p><p>
"Perhaps you meant to say 'precise dimension'?"</p><p>
"Maybe, but it's the same thing. Numbers always come out unchanged if you imagine space and time as deadened. But they're always in motion, and their motion changes the numbers, and then calculating is more interesting."</p><p>
Volodya went on to name some incredible formulas or arithmetic operations that were impossible to understand. All I remembered was that the formula was very long and basically unending. He animatedly cited the results of arithmetic operations, but they were always intermediate. Each time he named a number, Volodya would add animatedly, "Interacting with time, this number produces . . ."</p><p>
"Wait a minute, Volodya," I interrupted my son. "I don't understand your dimension. One plus one will always be two. Here, look, I take one stick."</p><p>
I picked up a small twig from the grass and placed it in front of my son. Then I found a second twig, put it next to the first and asked, "How many twigs are there?"</p><p>
"Two," Volodya replied.</p><p>
"There, exactly. Two. And it can't be otherwise in any dimension."</p><p>
"But in the live dimension it's a completely different calculation, Papa. I saw it."</p><p>
"What do you mean, you saw it? Can you show me the other dimension's calculation on your fingers?"</p><p>
"Yes, Papa."</p><p>
He raised his little hand in front of me, his fingers squeezed into a fist, and started showing me. First he unfolded one finger and said, "Mama." He unfolded a second finger: "Plus Papa, equals me"—and he unfolded a third finger. "Look, you get three fingers, and for there to be only two, you have to take one away. But I don't want to take away any of these fingers. I want there to be more of them, and in the live dimension this is possible."</p><p>
I didn't want one of the three fingers to be taken away either. I'd prefer this other—live—dimension, as he says, to exist. And for the count to increase. Great! One plus one equals three. Pretty unusual. Still, what remained most incomprehensible for me was the taiga book with the living letters.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>I Will Make the Universe-Girl Happy</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>I looked at my little son, who knew how to read the unusual and probably the most alive book in the world, which he opened up for me. I realized that reading all of it would take a great deal of time. In addition, I had to know the names of all the plants. But for some reason it made me feel good to know that it existed, this book, with its cheerful and different letters, as my son put it. And he would read it. But what then? When he grew up? He said, "I'll be like you, Papa." That means he'll enter our world, with its wars, drugs, crime, and poisoned water. Why should he go there? Yet he planned to. He planned to enter our world when he grew up and do something good. I wonder what?</p><p>
I asked, "Volodya, when you grow up, what business or occupation will you consider most important for you?"</p><p>
"Mama Anastasia told me. The very most important thing when I grow up: I have to make one universe-girl happy."</p><p>
"Who? Who is this Universe or girl?"</p><p>
"Every girl living on Earth is the likeness of the Universe. At first I didn't understand this. Then I read and read the book and I understood. Every girl is like the Universe. Every girl has all the universe's energies inside her. Universe-girls have to be happy. And I have to make one of them happy."</p><p>
"And how do you plan to carry out your intention when you grow up?"</p><p>
"I'll go where lots of people live and find her."</p><p>
"Who?"</p><p>
"The girl."</p><p>
"She will be unusually beautiful, of course?"</p><p>
"Probably. Or maybe she'll be a little bit sad and not all people will think she's beautiful. Maybe she'll be sick. Where you live, Papa, a lot of people are made sick by their surroundings."</p><p>
"Why do you need a girl who's not the prettiest and healthiest?"</p><p>
"Papa, I'm supposed to make my universe-girl the most beautiful, healthy, and happy."</p><p>
"But how? Though by the time you grow up, you'll probably learn how to make someone else—your girl—happy. But you still don't know everything about the world I live in, Volodya. You see, it might be that the girl you choose won't want to talk to you at all. Do you know whom modern girls pay attention to? You don't. I'll tell you. Pretty and not very, sick and healthy—they pay attention primarily to those who have a lot of money and a car, to those who dress well and have status in society. Not all of them, of course, but the majority are like that. Where are you going to get a lot of money?"</p><p>
"A lot—how much is that, Papa?"</p><p>
"Well, at least a million. And preferably in dollars. Do you know the currency units?"</p><p>
"Mama Anastasia told me about the different kinds of bills and coins people like. She says that people give them out for clothing, food, and different things."</p><p>
"They do. And where do they get them? Do you know? To get those coins, you have to work somewhere, and just working doesn't mean you'll make a lot. You have to be in business or invent something. Could you invent something people really need, Volodya?"</p><p>
"What kind of invention do people need most of all, Papa?"</p><p>
"What kind? Oh, lots. There is an energy crisis beginning in many regions, for example. There's not enough electricity. People don't want to build nuclear power plants because they're dangerous and blow up. But they can't get along without them, either."</p><p>
"Nuclear? The kind that give off radiation that kill people and plants?"</p><p>
"You know about radiation?"</p><p>
"Yes, it's everywhere. It's energy. It's good. And needed. Only you shouldn't collect it in such large amounts in one place. Grandfather taught me how to control radiation. Only I'm not supposed to talk about this. Some people turn good radiation into weapons in order to kill other people."</p><p>
"Yes. It's better not to talk about it. Apparently you really will be able to invent something and earn a lot of money for your girl."</p><p>
"I probably will. But money doesn't make a person happy."</p><p>
"What do you think does make a person happy?"</p><p>
"The dimension he creates himself."</p><p>
I pictured my little son becoming a young man. Naïve, even if he knows a lot of unusual things and different phenomena. Even knowing how to deal with radiation, still naïve with respect to the stratagems of our life, he'll go looking for his girl in order to make her happy. He'll try not to stand out among other people. That is what Anastasia always did when she came out from the taiga to be with people. He would try not to stand out, but nevertheless he wouldn't be able to be entirely the same as everyone else. He was preparing. He was taking in a tremendous amount of knowledge and trying to be physically healthy, and all for the sake of some certain girl. I'd thought Anastasia was preparing our son for great accomplishments and for this reason was conveying her knowledge and abilities to him. And now it turned out that a man's main purpose in life was to make just one woman happy. My son was convinced that every woman was akin to the entire Universe. Was that really true? An unusual philosophy, but be that as it may, my son was convinced of it, and he would consider it one of the chief purposes in his life to make just one girl happy, a girl he didn't even know. She might not even have been born yet. She might already be crawling or about to take her first steps. What if no young woman wanted to or, more likely, could love him?</p><p>
At first, when he fulfills her desire and brings her money, she may pretend to love him. How many women like that there are in our world! They're even prepared to marry an old man for the sake of money. They've learned to fake love.</p><p>
My son will grow up, meet someone like that, and fulfill her desires, and she'll say she loves him. But what happens to him when he starts talking about the need to create a dimension of Love and plant an orchard? Will she laugh? Will she consider this abnormal or will she understand? She may understand, but she may—no, better to warn him about the worst.</p><p>
"Understand, Volodya, when you find this girl and you succeed at making her healthy and very beautiful, the most beautiful, as you say, something might happen that you don't know anything about. The most beautiful girls in our world try to become models and actresses and go into show business. They like it when all the men around them pay them compliments. Well, imagine, she decides she wants to shine in public like a queen, and you start suggesting creating a dimension of Love to her. She may even hear you out, but that's all. She'll leave you and go where there are lots of lights, compliments, and applause, and for all you know she may leave you with a child, and then what will you do?"</p><p>
Without stopping to think, Volodya replied, "Then I will build the dimension myself. First myself, then with the child she leaves me, and we'll preserve Love in this dimension."</p><p>
"Preserve it for whom?"</p><p>
"For ourselves, Papa, and for the girl who, as you say, will leave for artificial lights."</p><p>
"Why should you prepare or preserve a dimension of Love for her specifically? There, you see, how naïve you are in these matters? You'll have to find another and to be more careful the next time."</p><p>
"If I find another, then who will make the girl who left happy?"</p><p>
"Whoever wants to can. Why should you rack your brains over her? She's gone and you're still here."</p><p>
"She'll come back, and she'll see the beautiful forest and orchard. I'll make it so that all the beasts obey and serve her. Everyone and everything in this dimension will sincerely love her. She'll probably come back when she's tired. She'll wash in pure water and rest. She'll become even more beautiful and won't want to leave her dimension of Love. Our dimension. She'll be happy, and the stars above her will be brighter and happier. But if you hadn't thought of it and produced the situation that she has to leave with your thought, Papa, then she wouldn't.</p><p>
"Me? I produced it?"</p><p>
"Yes, Papa. After all, it was you who said it. Your thought. Man creates different situations with his thought, and you just created it."</p><p>
"But you and your thought, can't they change the situation? Overcome mine? You did say it was fast, nearly like Anastasia's."</p><p>
"It might overcome it."</p><p>
"Then overcome it."</p><p>
"I don't want your thought and mine to fight, Papa. I'll look for another solution."</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>How To Surmount the Barrier?</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>I couldn't talk to my son anymore. He automatically checks all my words against his conception, which easily determines the truth and lie. He even refuted the conclusions of historians set forth in a textbook. I had no success whatsoever establishing paternal superiority over my son. The conversation had not given me greater authority and probably destroyed whatever authority I did have, thanks to Anastasia. Also, his strange confidence about the power of thought frightened me and distanced me from him. We were different. I did not make contact with the child like a father has with his son. He did not feel like my son. For me, he seemed like a different being in general. We were silent. Then I recalled Anastasia's words: "You absolutely have to be sincere and truthful with children." Anger even gripped me due to the despair of my situation. So, sincere? Truthful? I tried, and what came of it? Even if I were totally sincere and truthful. . . . Basically, in this situation it was easy to say the wrong thing.</p><p>
I blurted out in one breath, "Volodya, to be completely sincere, the conversation we're having is not like a conversation between father and son. We are different. We have different concepts, information, and knowledge. You don't feel like my son. I'm even afraid to touch you. In our world, you can just pet your child, and even punish or hit him for an offense. I can't even contemplate that kind of relationship with you. There is an insurmountable barrier between us."</p><p>
I fell silent. I sat there, silent, not knowing what more to say. I sat there and watched my thoughtful little son with the rather strange way of thinking.</p><p>
Turning his curly little head toward me, he again was the first to speak, but this time I sensed notes of sadness in his voice.</p><p>
"There's some kind of barrier between you and me, Papa? Is it hard for you to perceive me as your own son? You spend a lot of time there, in the other world, where everything's a little different from here. I know parents sometimes hit their children there, Papa. I thought, Papa . . . just a second."</p><p>
He quickly rose, ran off, and then came back carrying a branch with dry needles and held it out to me.</p><p>
"Take this branch, Papa, and hit me with it. The way parents hit their children in the other world where you spend so much time."</p><p>
"Hit you? Why? What have you come up with now?"</p><p>
"Papa, I know that there, in the world where you have to spend so much time, parents only hit their own children. I'm your son, Papa. You must hit me so you can feel like my papa. Maybe that will make you feel better. Only don't hit this arm or this leg, because this arm doesn't feel pain and this leg doesn't either, they're a little numb. But everything else on my body feels pain. Only I probably won't be able to cry the way children cry. I've never cried once."</p><p>
"That's crazy! Completely crazy! Never has anyone hit children like that, even in that world, as you say. Sometimes they punish children and give them a light spanking. But that's only when the children don't obey their parents and do something they shouldn't."</p><p>
"Yes, of course, Papa. When parents think their children have misbehaved."</p><p>
"That's it exactly."</p><p>
"So you must think I've misbehaved somehow, Papa."</p><p>
"What do you mean by 'think'? When someone has misbehaved, it's clear to everyone, it's not a matter of wanting to think someone has misbehaved. Everyone has to see the misbehavior."</p><p>
"The children who are hit, too?"</p><p>
"The children, too. That's why they're hit, so they understand their misbehavior."</p><p>
"And they can't understand that before it gets to hitting?"</p><p>
"That means they can't."</p><p>
"It's explained to them but they can't?"</p><p>
"They can't, and that's their fault."</p><p>
"And it's not the fault of the person who explained unclearly?"</p><p>
"The person who, I guess, no, he . . . now you've got me all mixed up with your lack of understanding!"</p><p>
"That's good, since I don't understand, then you can hit me. And there won't be a barrier between us."</p><p>
"How can you not understand? Punishment can follow when, for example . . . Well, for example . . . Your mama tells you sternly, 'Volodya, you shouldn't do that.' And despite her prohibition, you go and do what's been prohibited. Do you understand now?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"Have you ever once done what your mama prohibited?"</p><p>
"Yes, I have. Twice. And I will again, no matter how many times Mama Anastasia tells me not to."</p><p>
My conversation with my son continued in this way, not at all as I'd planned beforehand. I just couldn't show him modern civilized society, and consequently myself, in an advantageous light. I was so frustrated by my son's string of arguments that I banged my fist on a tree trunk. I told him—or, to a greater extent, myself—"Not all parents in our world punish their children by hitting them. Many, on the contrary, are searching for a proper system of upbringing. I did, too, but I didn't find it. When I came to see you in the taiga, you were still very little. I always wanted to hug you and squeeze you. But Anastasia said, 'You mustn't interrupt a child's thinking even with caresses. The child's thinking process is a very important process.' I could only look at you, but you were occupied with something the whole time. And now you see I can't figure out how to talk to you."</p><p>
"What about now, Papa? Don't you want to hug me anymore?"</p><p>
"I do, but I can't. Everything has been mixed up in my head with these systems of upbringing."</p><p>
"Then maybe I can do it. May I hug you, Papa? After all, our thoughts right now are identical."</p><p>
"You? You want to hug me, too?"</p><p>
"Yes, Papa!"</p><p>
He took a step toward me. I dropped to my knees and awkwardly sank to the ground. He hugged me tight around the neck with one hand and rested his little head on my shoulder. I heard his heart beating. And mine started beating rapidly at first and erratically. It got a little harder to breathe. A second or a minute later, probably, my erratically beating heart suddenly started evening out its rhythm, as if trying to match the beating of another heart. It became very easy to breathe. A state came over me . . . I felt like saying or shouting, "How wonderful everything around is! How beautiful man's life is! Thank you to whoever conceived of this world!" I felt like saying lots of other good things, too. But the words only took shape inside me.</p><p>
I stroked my son's hair and asked him in a whisper, for some reason, "Tell me, son. What could you do that your mama forbade? And that you plan to repeat as well?"</p><p>
"Once when I saw Mama Anastasia," Volodya answered, also in a whisper at first, not lifting his head from my shoulder, "when I saw. . . ." He pulled away from me, sat down on the ground, and stroked the grass. "The grass is always green when it feels good."</p><p>
He was silent for a while. Then he raised his little head and continued.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>I Will Save My Mama</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"Once Mama was gone for a long time. I thought, 'Where is she?' And I decided Mama was in the next glade next to ours. It looks like ours but it isn't as nice. I went to the next glade. I saw Mama there. She was lying without moving, and she was all white. And the grass around my motionless mama was white.</p><p>
"At first I stood there and thought, 'Why is this happening? Mama's face and the grass around her shouldn't be completely white.' Then I decided to touch Mama, and she opened her eyes with difficulty, but she didn't move. Then I picked up her hand and started dragging her out of the white circle. She helped me with her other hand, and we got out of the white circle.</p><p>
When Mama was her old self, she told me I should never touch her if the same thing ever happened again. She would deal with it herself, but I couldn't. After I was in the white circle and dragged Mama, my arm and leg became numb and were tired for a long time. Mama went back to being herself quickly, but my arm and leg were tired for a long time.</p><p>
When I saw Mama in the same kind of circle a second time, lying there all white, I didn't touch Mama myself. I shouted and called to the strong bear I slept on when I was little. I told the bear to drag Mama. The bear stepped on the white and fell, and now the bear isn't living anymore. Only the bear's children are left.</p><p>
The bear died the moment it stepped on the white. Everything dies on the white grass.</p><p>
Then I myself walked over the white circle and started dragging Mama Anastasia. We dragged ourselves out of the dead grass together. But my hand and leg weren't as numb as the first time, only my body kept shaking a little. It doesn't now. See, Papa? My little body doesn't shake, it obeys me. And soon my arm will go up when I want. It already does a little now. But before it wouldn't at all."</p><p>
Stunned, I listened to my son's story. I remembered seeing Anastasia in a similar situation once myself and also intuitively trying to drag her out of the white circle. I remembered the old philosopher Nikolai Fyodorovich talking about this.</p><p>
Why does she expose herself to this danger? She even risks her son. Is it really that important, to burn up inside her the aimed invisible energy?</p><p>
Unusual circles of regular geometric form has been shown more than once on television. They've appeared in different countries, primarily in fields of grain. People have discovered amid normally growing stalks a circle where the stalks were pressed to the earth. Not pressed chaotically but bent over to one side and forming geometric shapes. Scientists are studying these incomprehensible phenomena, but they have yet to give an explanation. In the case of Anastasia there is also a circle and crushed grass, but in addition to what they showed on television, the grass is also white, as if it lacked sunlight.</p><p>
Anastasia said that this was negative energy produced by people. Suppose it is, but why is it aimed strictly at Anastasia? What kind of people are aiming it at her?</p><p>
Forgetting myself, I said out loud, "Why is she fighting it? Who needs this? Who could be better off from this?"</p><p>
"Everyone a little bit"—I heard my son's voice. "Mama says that if there is less angry energy, if she can decrease it by burning it up inside her instead of reflecting it into space, there will be less of it. Even those who produce it will become better."</p><p>
"Can you show me how many white circles there? Where are they?"</p><p>
"Next to our glade there is a very little glade. There are always white circles appearing there. Then the grass turns green again, but right now it isn't all green yet and you can see the white circles. If you want we can go and I'll show them to you, Papa."</p><p>
"Let's go."</p><p>
I quickly stood up and took my little son's hand. The child took quick little steps, but I noticed him limping slightly and so tried not to go so fast.</p><p>
From time to time, Volodya tried to look me in the eye and kept mumbling something, telling a story as he went. But I was thinking about these strange white circles and Anastasia's incomprehensible behavior, the meaning of her actions, and this strange phenomenon in general.</p><p>
In order to keep up the conversation with my son, I asked him, "Volodya, why do you call your mother 'Mama' sometimes and 'Mama Anastasia' sometimes?"</p><p>
"I know about all the mamas who once lived on Earth. Mama Anastasia told me about them. You can call them grandmothers, you can call them great-great grandmothers, but you can also call them mamas. Grandmothers gave birth to mama. They can be called mamas, too. I can feel them and see them and I can picture them when I hear stories about them, and sometimes I can just picture them myself. And so I don't get mixed up, I sometimes call mama 'Mama Anastasia.' All the mamas are good, but for me Mama Anastasia is the nearest and best. She's prettier than the flowers and the clouds. She's very interesting and cheerful. I hope she'll always be that. Soon I'll be able to chase down my thought so fast I'll always be able to bring her back."</p><p>
I didn't listen to or comprehend everything he said. We arrived at the small glade and I saw four whitish circles in the grass. The circles were five or six meters in diameter. They were barely noticeable, but one stood out for its whiteness and was probably created quite recently. Then I realized why Anastasia hadn't met me and why she wasn't here with me now. That meant she was somewhere entirely drained, and she didn't want people to pity her or be upset at her appearance.</p><p>
I looked at the white circles and my thoughts raced quickly. Of course, lots of people turn pale from the unpleasant things that happen to them. People almost always turn white when anger is suddenly aimed at them. But here? Could it really be felt like that at this great distance? Could human anger really be concentrated into one quantity of energy, so huge that not only the person himself but even the vegetation around him turned white? This meant it probably could. Here they were—the traces of the most malicious attempts. Once again I recalled Anastasia's words, quoted in my fourth book: "All the evil on earth, leave your affairs behind and rush toward me. I am alone before you, vanquish me. Come at me, all of you, to vanquish me. The battle will be without battle." I thought these were just words. It's all coming to pass. The books exist, as do the bards' songs and the poems, just as she predicted. She does not simply say these things. What does "The battle will be without battle" mean? In the end, she is trying to burn up the anger inside her by herself. I think they should be fought in a real battle, face to face. But she's alone. No! You won't be alone, Anastasia! I will take on at least some of this vileness and fight it. Oh, if only I could speak the way she does. I would tell them. I would probably get seriously angry and blurt out: "Come on, evil ones, come at me, and I'll burn up at least some of you!"</p><p>
Little Vladimir suddenly pulled his hand out of mine, ran forward, and looked me in the eye with amazement and attention. Then he stamped his foot, took his still weak arm with his healthy hand, raised both arms over his head and cried out in my same tone, "Come at me, too, evil ones. Look, my arm is already getting better. Mama Anastasia isn't alone. Here I am, and my thinking is racing faster and faster. Hurry up, evil ones, hurry to me. Here, look at how I'm growing."</p><p>
And he stood on tiptoe, trying to raise his arms even higher.</p><p>
"So, my glorious, desperate, and daring warriors. Who were you planning to fight, my knights?" I heard Anastasia's quiet voice.</p><p>
I turned around and saw Anastasia sitting under a cedar, her head leaning against its trunk. She was obviously terribly tired and was even leaning her head against the trunk. Both her arms and her shoulders drooped toward the earth. Her face was pale and her eyes slightly shut.</p><p>
"Papa and I have risen up against the evil, Mama," Volodya answered for me.</p><p>
"But to fight evil, you have to know where it lies. You must picture your opponent in detail." Anastasia said quietly and with effort.</p><p>
"Mama dear, you rest here for a while and Papa and I will try to picture it. If we can't, you'll give us a hint afterward."</p><p>
"Your papa has had a long journey, son. He should rest up first."</p><p>
"I have rested, Anastasia, and basically, I'm barely tired at all. Hello, Anastasia. How are you here?"</p><p>
For some reason, I fell still where I was at her helpless look and started talking incoherently, not knowing how to act or what to do or say next. Volodya walked up to me, took my hand, and continued, addressing Anastasia:</p><p>
"I'll feed Papa after his trip and bathe with him in the pure water in the lake. And I'll pick cleansing herbs. Mama dear, you rest here for now. Don't waste your strength on conversations. I'll do everything myself. Then Papa and I will come back to you. I hope your strength comes back quickly."</p><p>
"Wait, I'll bathe with you, too. I'm coming with you."</p><p>
Grabbing onto the cedar trunk, Anastasia tried to get up. She rose a little and dropped back to the ground helplessly, her palms slipping down the tree trunk, and whispered barely audibly,</p><p>
"Oh, what a blunder I've committed. I can't get up to meet my son and my love?"</p><p>
Leaning on the cedar trunk again, she made a great effort to rise from the grass. This time, too, she probably would not be able to get up. But all of a sudden something incredible happened. The huge cedar whose trunk Anastasia was leaning on suddenly began aiming the needles of its lower branches in her direction.</p><p>
The downward-aiming needles began emitting a barely noticeable blue illumination. Slowly, almost invisibly, it enveloped Anastasia. Then I heard a crackling coming from above, like what you might hear standing under high-voltage lines. I looked up and saw the needles of all the cedars around suddenly start glowing faintly with a blue light, too. But that was still not all. Some were aimed at the tree under which Anastasia was trying to stand. It was taking in with the needles of its upper branches the light coming from the neighboring cedars. The light from the lower needles kept getting stronger and stronger. This lasted for about two minutes. Then there was a blue flash. The cedar needles stopped shining. It seemed to me they even withered a little. Anastasia was barely visible in the blue illumination enveloping her. When it dispersed or entered her, I couldn't understand what I saw.</p><p>
Under the cedar stood the former, unusually beautiful Anastasia, full of strength. She was smiling at me and her son. She raised her head and quietly said, "Thank you." I was amazed at what had been done for this grown woman.</p><p>
Anastasia took a light hop where she stood and ran lightly and swiftly toward the largest white circle. At its edge she took another hop, high this time, did a triple somersault and ended up in the center of the circle. Once again, she jumped up and did the splits, like a ballerina. She laughed her cascading, enticing laugh and spun in a dance over the white circles.</p><p>
All around, the forest seemed to come to life and echoed her happy excitement. The squirrels leapt from branch to branch, racing in a circle. The eyes of other beasts shone in the bushes. Two eagles descended quite low toward the glade, below the treetops, very swiftly, one after the other, and once again gained altitude, and once again descended around the circle, and once again went up.</p><p>
Anastasia danced and laughed like an acrobat, like a ballerina. And slowly, the grass turned green under her feet. Even the whitest circle became barely noticeable. I felt more and more cheerful from her dance and laughter and everything around. Suddenly my little son ran into a circle that was still a little white, did two somersaults, quickly jumped up, took a leap, and spun, trying to repeat Anastasia's dance. I couldn't restrain myself either, and I too began dancing next to him and simply jumping joyously.</p><p>
"Forward, to the water! Who can catch me?" Anastasia exclaimed, and she ran swiftly toward the lake, and my son and I ran right after her.</p><p>
I was a little out of breath from jumping and I lagged behind. But I saw Anastasia take a little hop, somersault over the water, and dive into the lake. Behind her, a little later, taking a running jump, my little son jumped from the shore and splashed into the water bottom-first.</p><p>
I undressed as I ran, casting my clothes aside as I went, and carried away, before I could remove my tee-shirt, trousers, and boots, dove into the lake in my clothes and surfaced to Anastasia's cascading laughter. And our son, overflowing with emotions, laughed and splashed.</p><p>
I got out of the water first. I started pulling off my wet clothes and wringing them out. When Anastasia got out of the water she quickly put her light shift on her wet body and started helping me hang my trousers on a bush so they would dry out quickly in the breeze. Then I got my tracksuit out of my backpack and put it on. Anastasia stood beside me, and her shift was already dry. I felt like embracing her, but somehow I didn't have the nerve.</p><p>
She walked right up to me, emanating warmth. I felt like saying something nice to her, but the words wouldn't come. I said only this: "Thank you, Anastasia."</p><p>
She smiled, put her hands on my shoulders, and leaning her head on my shoulder, replied, "And thank you, Vladimir."</p><p>
"Wonderful!" our son's cheerful voice rang out. "I'm leaving now."</p><p>
"And where are you going?" Anastasia asked.</p><p>
"I'm going to see my older grandfather and allow him to bury the body and I'll help him. I'm going."</p><p>
Volodya left quickly, barely limping at all.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0603>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>3. Invitation to the Future</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div>
</p><p>
"What does that mean, 'I'll let my grandfather bury the body?'" I asked in amazement.</p><p>
"You'll see it all for yourself. You'll understand," Anastasia replied.</p><p>
A little later, I saw Anastasia's living great-grandfather but did not see any burial, and so he remained alive and inscrutable in my memory.</p><p>
Anastasia was the first to sense her grandfathers' approach. At that moment, she and I were walking through the glade together. Suddenly Anastasia stopped, stopped me with a gesture, and turned toward where the highest and mightiest cedars grew. I followed her gaze without seeing anyone and wanted to ask, "What's going on?" but couldn't. She took me by the hand and pressed my palm lightly, as if asking me not to utter a word.</p><p>
Soon after, I saw the figure of Anastasia's great-grandfather among the tall cedars. The majestic old man was wearing a light gray shirt that fell below his knees. When he emerged onto the glade, walking unhurriedly but surely and not at all like an old man, I saw our son and his great-grandson, Volodya, walking next to him, holding his hand, taking tiny steps. The grandfather—the old man's son—was a little way off.</p><p>
Everyone, even I, seemed to understand the solemnity of the moment, and only the child walking next to the old man acted naturally and without constraint. Volodya was talking to his great-grandfather the whole time, sometimes running a little ahead to look into his face, then suddenly stopping, dropping the old man's hand, and leaning over the grass when something caught his interest, and then the old man would stop. Then Volodya would take his hand again and draw him toward us while chatting about what he had seen.</p><p>
When they came up quite close, I saw that the usually stern and majestic old man was smiling slightly. His bright face emanated a kind of grace and solemnity at the same time. He stopped a few paces away, and he gazed somewhere in the distance. Everyone was silent, only Volodya spoke quickly.</p><p>
"Here, Granddaddy, my papa and mama are in front of you. They're nice. Your eyes can't see, Granddaddy, but you can still feel them. But my eyes can see. Look with my eyes at the nice thing and then you'll feel good, too."</p><p>
Then, addressing us, Volodya suddenly declared with even more joy, "Mama and Papa, when we were bathing together just now, I understood and allowed grandfather Moses's body to die. We've already found the place where I'll bury his body."</p><p>
Volodya pressed his whole little body and head to his great-grandfather's leg. The majestic, gray-haired old man stroked his great-grandson's hair gently and cautiously. There was love, tenderness, mutual understanding, and joy in their relationship. At the same time, the references to a burial seemed very strange to me. As most people do, I wanted to stop my son and say that his great-grandfather looked well and was going to live for a long time—what we always say, after all, even to a very sick, elderly person. I was about to say it. I'd even drawn breath into my chest. But Anastasia suddenly pressed my hand, and I said nothing.</p><p>
Her great-grandfather began, addressing Anastasia. "The dimension you have created, granddaughter Anastasia, what does your thought limit?"</p><p>
"My thought and dream have merged into one without encountering any limitations," Anastasia replied.</p><p>
Her great-grandfather then asked her, "Human souls have accepted the world you have created. Tell me, what kind of energy are you acting by?"</p><p>
"The kind that raises a tree and opens buds, turning them into flowers."</p><p>
"What forces could impede your dream?"</p><p>
"When I dream, I don't model barriers. I only see what is insurmountable as I go."</p><p>
"You are free in everything, my granddaughter Anastasia. Tell my soul to be incarnated in what pleases you."</p><p>
"I cannot allow myself to instruct anyone's soul. The soul is free. It is the Creator's creation. But I will dream that your soul finds a worthy incarnation in our very beautiful garden, my dear grandfather."</p><p>
There was a pause. Her great-grandfather did not ask any more questions, and then, once again, turning to his grandfather, Volodya began speaking quickly.</p><p>
"I'm not going to instruct you, either, Granddaddy. Only I ask you very much. Be incarnated on Earth with your soul as fast as possible. You'll rise anew, young, and you'll be my best friend. Or you'll be something else for me. I'm not telling you what to do; I'm just saying, dear Granddaddy Moses, that I want your soul to be next to mine inside me."</p><p>
At these words, the majestic old man turned to Volodya, slowly dropped before him, first on one knee and then on the other, bowed his gray head, brought the child's small hand to his lips, and kissed it. Volodya hugged him around the neck and started whispering something quickly in his ear.</p><p>
Then his great-grandfather rose from his knees, and just the child helped this very old man. Even now, recalling this scene for the umpteenth time, I can't understand how this happened. They simply held each other's hands and the great-grandfather got up without leaning on anything. Once he was up, he took a step toward us, bowed, and without saying a word, turned, held his hand out to his grandson, and they started out, holding hands and talking. The second grandfather walked a little behind, without interrupting their conversation.</p><p>
I realized that Anastasia's great-grandfather was going away forever. He was going away to die.</p><p>
I couldn't take my eyes off the child and old man. Even before, from what Anastasia said, I had known about her attitude toward modern cemetery rituals and funerals, and I had even written about this in previous books. She—which meant all her kin who had ever lived and were now living in the taiga—believed that there should not be cemeteries. They resembled latrines where people throw out the dead person's lifeless body that no one needs anymore. They believe that people are afraid of cemeteries because something unnatural is done there. They believe that it is the dead person's relatives, by their thought and notions of him as irrevocably gone, who don't let his soul be reincarnated in its new earthly incarnation.</p><p>
Analyzing the funerals I'd seen, I was inclined to agree with that idea. There was too much falsity in them. How the relatives grieve over the dead, but if you go to a cemetery just a few years later, you discover that a well-kept grave ten to twenty years old is a rarity. Workers dig new graves on the sites of neglected graves.</p><p>
Everyone forgets the buried person. Nothing of his sojourn on Earth remains, and no one even needs the memory of him. Why was he born, why did he live, if that is the end? Anastasia says that the bodies of the deceased should be buried on their own homestead and their graves not marked by special tombstones. The grass and flowers, trees and bushes that grow up will be the continuation of the body's life. At the same time, the soul that has quit the body will have a greater opportunity for beautiful incarnations. On the homestead, the dead person's thought created a dimension of Love during his life. His descendants will continue to live in this dimension, touching everything that grows in it, and in this way they touch the thoughts of their parents and preserve what they created. But the dimension preserves those living in it as well. In this way continuing earthly life eternally.</p><p>
But what about people who live in cities? How can they get along without cemeteries? Perhaps their way of life will make them think, if only at an advanced age, that one shouldn't live one's life so irresponsibly forever.</p><p>
I agree with Anastasia's philosophy. However, it is one thing to agree in your thoughts and quite another to see it in reality, as I did with the farewell to her dying great-grandfather, although he—or rather his soul—will not die in this case. It will obviously remain somewhere here or be incarnated very quickly in a new life, undoubtedly a good one. After all, none of them—not Anastasia, not her little son, not her grandfather, not her great-grandfather himself—has ever projected tragedies in their thoughts, and they understand something different about death than we do. For them, it is not a tragedy but merely a transition into a new and beautiful existence.</p><p>
Stop! Even her great-grandfather wasn't sad. Quite the opposite. Look! Here it is, the puzzle's solution. "When you fall asleep oppressed by dark, heavy, and unpleasant thoughts, then as a rule you will have a nightmare. When your thoughts are light before you go to sleep, you'll have a pleasant dream," Anastasia said. And also: ". . . death is not a tragedy, it is merely a brief dream, or a little longer one, it doesn't matter. A person must plunge into any dream with beautiful thoughts, and then his soul will not suffer. By his thoughts, man himself can build a paradise or something else for his soul."</p><p>
Her great-grandfather knew this. He did not suffer. But what in his final hours afforded him such obvious joy? Something happened. He could not have been smiling just like that, without reason. But what happened? I turned toward Anastasia.</p><p>
She was standing a little away from me, her arms stretched sunward, and whispering some kind of prayer, it seemed to me. The Sun's rays would hide behind the clouds, then shine brightly and be reflected in the teardrop sliding down Anastasia's cheek. At the same time, the expression on her face was pacific, not sad. She would whisper something and then listen, as if someone were answering her. I stood and waited, not daring for some reason to come any closer to her or even to say a word. Only when she turned around, saw me, and walked up did I ask,</p><p>
"Were you praying for your great-grandfather's soul to rest in peace, Anastasia?"</p><p>
"My great-grandfather's soul will rest in great peace, and earthly life will be presented to it once again when it itself wants that. I was asking for my son, for the Creator to give him great strength. Vladimir, our son has committed acts present in very few people today. He took in all of his great-grandfather's strength, and his great-grandfather gave it to him with all his heart. When he grows up a little, it will be hard for him to hold the many energies inside himself in unity."</p><p>
"But why, when all this happened, did I notice nothing unusual in our son?"</p><p>
"Vladimir, our son uttered words before his great-grandfather knelt before him. He uttered words whose meaning is understandable only to those who can know how our Creator created. The child may not understand completely, but he told his great-grandfather sincerely and confidently that he was capable of leaving his soul and him on Earth. I would not let myself say something like that. I do not feel that kind of strength in myself."</p><p>
"And after these words, your great-grandfather, I noticed, shone even more powerfully."</p><p>
"Yes, few in their deep old age have occasion to hear anything like this. After all, my great-grandfather received an invitation to the future from the mouth of a child—the incarnation of the Future."</p><p>
"So did they love each other very much?"</p><p>
"Vladimir, our son asked my great-grandfather to stay living when he no longer could. And my great-grandfather did, incapable of refusing the child."</p><p>
"But how is such a thing possible?"</p><p>
"It's very simple. And not always simple. After all, doctors also bring people back from unconsciousness and near-death. I'm not a doctor, but someone close can call or spur someone out of a coma or unconsciousness, so the person can live. My great-grandfather's will and love allowed him to continue his life at his grandson's request. My great-grandfather is the descendant of those priests who accomplished great things through the ages. Once he even stopped an unprecedented explosion through his will and gaze, and he went blind."</p><p>
"What gaze? Can an explosion really be stopped by a gaze?"</p><p>
"Yes, if the person looks with intelligence and confidence in the power of man's steadfast will. My great-grandfather knew where the misfortune would be and went there. He was a little late with his vision, so there was a first explosion. But he stood in the face of what was lethal and with his gaze pacified the manifestations of the dark forces that had already hurtled into space. There was only one explosion, and that one not full force, and two others might have occurred. But if my great-grandfather had blinked just once . . . Vladimir, he did not let the explosion happen, but he went blind."</p><p>
"But why are you so concerned about the powers our son received from his grandfather?"</p><p>
"I felt that mine and yours were enough for him. I taught him how to conceal anything extra that might seem unusual to people. I wanted our son to go into the world to live and not to differ outwardly from other people. One can create a great deal, after all, without standing out from others. But something too unusual happened. It is essential for you and for me to understand who our son is now and where his predestination lies. I asked the Creator to give him strength so that he could remain an ordinary child just a little longer."</p><p>
"You're upset now, Anastasia. I think your upbringing is to blame for much of this. You talk a lot about the soul and man's purpose. You taught the child to read an unusual book about co-creation. He has already shaped his own graphic vision of how the world is arranged. Why should a child at that age know about the Soul and God? Imagine, he calls me papa and at the same time says that he has a father. I realized he calls God his Father. But all this is a little complicated for even me to understand, and you burdened a child with this. Your upbringing is at fault, Anastasia."</p><p>
"Vladimir, remember, I told my great-grandfather that I cannot tell anyone's soul what to do, and our son heard my answer. Yet all the powers higher than me allowed him to act differently. But don't worry. I will be able to understand what has happened, although our son may now perceive even me differently. He will soon be stronger than you and me put together."</p><p>
"Well, that's fine. Every generation should be stronger and smarter than the previous one."</p><p>
"Yes. You're right, of course, Vladimir, but there is sadness in this, when someone is stronger and more aware than his generation."</p><p>
"What? I don't understand. What sadness are you talking about, Anastasia?"</p><p>
She didn't answer but lowered her head, and the expression on her face became sad. She is rarely melancholy or sad. But this time I realized the great tragedy of the beautiful Siberian taiga hermit, Anastasia. She was lonely, incredibly lonely. Her worldview, knowledge, and abilities substantially distinguished her from other people. The stronger these are, the more tragic the loneliness. She lived in another dimension of consciousness. As wonderful as this dimension was, she was in it alone. Of course, she could descend to other people's level and become like everyone else, but she hadn't done that. Why? Because to do that she would have had to betray herself and her principles, and maybe even God. Then she decided to do something incredible. She invited others into her beautiful dimension, and some were able to understand her. Even I seem to have begun to understand her with more than my brain. Six years have passed, and I am only now beginning to understand. She has been waiting patiently, explaining everything calmly, not getting angry, enduring, unshakeable in her hope. Jesus Christ was probably as lonely as she. Of course, he had disciples and people were constantly coming to listen to him. But who could be a friend? A friend who understood instinctively and helped out in a difficult moment. She didn't have a single kindred spirit beside her. Not a single one.</p><p>
God! How do most people imagine Him? An inaccessible, amorphous, insensible essence. It's always, "Give me!" and "Judge!" But if God is our Father, if He has created the entire world that surrounds us, then, naturally, the Parent's main desire can only be His children's conscious life, their understanding of the essence of the universe, and joint creation with His children. But what kind of awareness can we speak of if we are trampling everything created around us by God, trampling His thoughts, and at the same time bowing down in different ways to all kinds of things not Him. He does not need worship; He waits for collaboration. But we just can't understand the simplest truth: if you are the son of God and capable of understanding the Father, take just one hectare of land and make a paradise on it, make the Father happy. Yet humanity is striving, as if gone crazy, but for what? Who is constantly turning us into crazy people? What is it like for Him, the Father, to gaze upon the earthly bacchanalia? To gaze and wait for awareness to come to His earthly sons and daughters. To gaze and light up the whole Earth with the Sun so that His children can breathe. How can we understand the essence of being? How can we make sense of what is actually happening to us? Is it mass psychosis or the effect of something conceived by certain forces? What kind? When will we be freed? Who are they?</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0604>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>4. The Sleeping Civilisation</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div>
</p><p>
This conversation took place on the second day.</p><p>
Anastasia and I were sitting at my long-favorite spot, on the shore of the lake, not talking. Evening was falling, but its coolness had not yet come. A barely sensible breeze fanned our bodies. It constantly changed direction, as if on purpose, and brought us the taiga's different fragrances for our pleasure.</p><p>
Anastasia was looking at the lake's watery surface with a faint smile, as if she were waiting for me to ask the questions I wanted answers to. I was having trouble formulating these questions briefly and specifically. What my mind put together did not seem to reflect the main thing I wanted to know, so I began in a roundabout way.</p><p>
"Anastasia, here I am writing books which have many of your words, but not all your words are immediately understandable to me. Most of all, not even the words, the reaction to them is incomprehensible.</p><p>
"Before I met you, I was an entrepreneur. I worked and wanted as much money as possible, like everyone else. I could allow myself to drink, and to have a good time with friends, but no one ever criticized me and the workers in my firm the way the press has come down on me now.</p><p>
"It's odd, but then no one blamed me for making money. Yet when the books came out, certain people started publishing articles painting me as a mercenary entrepreneur, a charlatan practically, an obscurantist. It would be all right if it were only me, but they also insult my readers. They call them obscurantists and sectarians. Heaven knows what they say about you in general. First they try to prove you don't exist at all. Then they say you're the number one pagan.</p><p>
"It's a strange business in general. Various small ethnicities live here, in Siberia, they have different cultures and religions, they still have shamans, and no one says anything bad about them. On the contrary, they say we should preserve the culture of these ethnicities. You live here alone, well, with your grandfather and great-grandfather, and now your son. You ask for nothing for yourself, but the words you utter have raised a storm of controversy. Some people rejoice at the words you have spoken, take delight in them, and have begun to act. Others attack you with ferocious anger. Why is that?"</p><p>
"And you yourself, Vladimir, you can't answer this question?"</p><p>
"Me?"</p><p>
"Yes, you."</p><p>
"Very strange thoughts come to mind. I get the impression that there are people, or some kind of unknown forces, in the human community, that very much want people to suffer. These forces need wars, drug addiction, prostitution, and diseases. They need all these negative phenomena to get stronger. How else to explain it? They don't attack books about murders or magazines with half-naked women, but they don't like books about nature and the soul. It's even more incomprehensible with you. Here you are calling for people to build heavenly homesteads for happy families, and a great many people support you. They support you not just in words. People are beginning to act. I myself have seen people who have already taken land and are taking care of it the way you said to and are building their own homesteads. They include both young and old, poor and rich, but some people deeply dislike this. They are constantly trying to distort what you said in the press. Indeed, they lie outright. I can't understand why the words of someone living in the taiga, apparently not bothering anyone, are so effective.</p><p>
"And why would anyone actually start to fight them? They also say that there is some great force behind them, behind the words you say, some occultism."</p><p>
"And what do you think? Is there a force behind them, or are they just words?"</p><p>
"I think that there is some kind of occult force in them. That is what some esoterics say as well."</p><p>
"Vladimir, try to sift out what people say. Try listening to your own heart and soul."</p><p>
"I do try, but I just don't have enough information."</p><p>
"What kind of information specifically?"</p><p>
"Well, for instance, what nationality are you, Anastasia, and what faith are you and your relatives? Or don't you have a nationality?"</p><p>
"I do," Anastasia replied, and she stood up, "but if I say the word now, something dark will rouse and shriek in fright. Then not only will it attempt to bring every bit of its might down on me but it will also try to sting you. You might withstand that if you can ignore their efforts and give your thought over to the beautiful reality. But if you consider yourself unprotected against what is malicious, take back your question and forget about it for a while."</p><p>
Anastasia stood in front of me with her arms by her sides. I looked up at her and could not help but notice how proud, beautiful, and intractable her bearing was. Her kind and questioning look was waiting for an answer. I had no doubt that the word she uttered really could call forth some unusual reaction because in the years I had known her, I had witnessed more than once of the stormy reaction to her words from many people. So I knew of the possible danger, but I replied, "I’m not afraid, though I'm certain it will all be as you say. I may be able to withstand it, but after all, it is not just me. We have a son. I don't want anything to threaten him."</p><p>
Right then, our son suddenly walked up to Anastasia. He had probably been standing quietly somewhere nearby, listening to our conversation, and not interrupting it. But when we started talking about him, he must have felt he could declare himself.</p><p>
Volodya took Anastasia's hand in his, pressed his cheek to it, raised his little head, and said, "Mama Anastasia, answer Papa's question. I can stand up for myself. You don't have to hide the story from people because of me."</p><p>
"Yes, it's true, you are strong, and you will be stronger with each passing day." Anastasia stroked his childish head. She looked me right in the eye, pronouncing her letters more distinctly than usual, as if for the first time introducing herself, and said, "I am a Ved-russ, Vladimir."</p><p>
The word Anastasia uttered truly did give rise to an unusual sensation inside me. It was as if a weak electrical shock had run through my body like a pleasant warmth, informing every cell in my body of something. In the surrounding space, something unusual seemed to happen. The word itself said nothing to me, but for some reason I stood up when I heard it, as if I had remembered something.</p><p>
Once again, joyously now, Volodya spoke.</p><p>
"Mama Anastasia, you are a Vedruss beauty, and I am a Vedruss."</p><p>
Then he looked at me with a joyous smile and said, "You are my papa. You are a Vedruss, too, like me, only a sleeping one. I'm talking too much again, right, Mama? So I'll go. I thought of something beautiful for Papa and you. Before the Sun sets behind the trees, I will create what I've thought of." My son bounded off when he saw Anastasia's nod of approval.</p><p>
I looked at Anastasia standing in front of me and thought, "Vedrusses must be one of the innumerous Ugric ethnicities that still reside in regions of the Far North and Siberia."</p><p>
In 1994, there was an international festival in the Khanty-Mansiisk Autonomous Region of documentary filmmakers studying Ugric ethnicities. At the request of the regional administration, a large number of festival participants were lodged on my ship. I talked with them, watched the films in competition, and went with them to distant settlements of Siberia where there were still shamans. I didn't remember much about the culture and customs of these very small ethnicities, but for some reason I did remember the melancholy feeling at the thought that these ethnicities were dying out. People look at them like exotica that will soon vanish from the face of the Earth.</p><p>
I hadn't heard anything from festival participants about the Vedruss ethnicity, so I asked Anastasia, "Have your people died out, Anastasia? Or rather, are there very few people left of it? Where did they settle before?"</p><p>
"Our people have not died out, Vladimir, they've fallen asleep. Our people kept vigil happily on our territory, which is now marked by the borders of such states as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, England, Germany, France, India, China, and many other states large and small.</p><p>
"Very recently, just five thousand years ago, our people were still keeping vigil happily from the Mediterranean and Black seas to the extreme northern regions.</p><p>
"We are Asians, Europeans, Russians, and those who have recently begun calling themselves Americans and who are in fact people-gods from a certain Vedruss civilization.</p><p>
"There was a period of life on our planet called the Vedian period.</p><p>
"During the Vedian period, humanity achieved a level of knowledge that allowed it to create energy images through collective thought and completed the transition to a new period, the Image Period.</p><p>
"With the help of the energy images created by collective thought, humanity acquired the opportunity to create in the Universe. It could have built a life similar to life on other planets—if, that is, in transitioning to the Image Period, it had not made one mistake.</p><p>
"For during the Image Period, which lasted nine thousand earth-years, a mistake was always made in the co-creation of one or several images at once.</p><p>
"A mistake was made if on Earth, in human society, there were still people with insufficient purity of intentions and culture of feelings and thoughts.</p><p>
"It blocked the possibility of creating in the Universe's expanses and shifted humanity toward occultism.</p><p>
"The Occult Period of life for people has lasted just one thousand years. It began with the intensive degradation of human consciousness. In the final analysis, the degradation of consciousness and the insufficient purity of intentions, given the high level of knowledge and opportunities, has always led humanity toward planetary disaster.</p><p>
"This was repeated many times over billions of earth-years.</p><p>
"Now it is the Occult Period of life for humanity on Earth and, as always, a disaster on a planetary scale should have occurred. It should have, but the deadline for it has passed. The end of the Occult millennium has gone by. Now each person must make sense of his predestination and essence and where the mistake lay. If we help one another, mentally travel history's entire journey in reverse, and determine the error, then an era of happy life will ensue on Earth, the likes of which the planet has never seen. The Universe awaits this with bated breath and great hope.</p><p>
"The dark forces are still alive, dominating over the majority, and they are feverishly trying to rule people through their minds. But for the first time, they did not notice how unusually the Vedrusses behaved back five thousand years ago.</p><p>
"When a distorted awareness gave birth on Earth to an image that coveted rule over people, the first war among people began, and people, led by an image, began killing one another. This happened many times on Earth before a disaster on a planetary scale. This time, however, and for the first time, the Vedrusses' civilization did not enter into the struggle on the nonmaterial plane.</p><p>
"The Vedrusses fell asleep in territories large and small, turning off a part of their consciousness and sensations.</p><p>
"The former human being seemed still to be living on Earth. Children were born, housing was built, attacking armies carried out orders. The Vedrusses seemingly submitted to the darkness, but herein lay the great secret: unbowed, sleeping, the Vedrusses still lived on all planes of being. The happy civilization has slept until the present day, and it will sleep until he who is not sleeping finds the mistake in the image creation, the mistake that led us to the present state of Earthly civilization.</p><p>
"When the mistake is defined with absolute accuracy, the words of the unsleeping and sleeping will be heard and they will begin waking one another from their slumber.</p><p>
"I can't say who invented this move; probably whoever did was very close to God.</p><p>
"Try to wake up just a little, you Vedruss, and take a look at the course of history.</p><p>
"Our people fell asleep on various continents.</p><p>
"Three thousand years ago, our people kept vigil only on the territory of present-day Russia.</p><p>
"The time of the dark forces had already come upon the whole Earth. Only on the island now called Russia did Vedrusses continue to live happily.</p><p>
"They needed, and needed very much, to hold on for another millennium. To decide how to pass on knowledge for the future, how to make sense of what was going on on Earth, and how not to repeat the mistake in the future. They were able to sustain themselves on this island for fifteen hundred years more. They did not drive back attacks on the material plane. The darkness had already taken power over the human mind all over the Earth. The priests, who placed themselves above God, decided to create their own occult world. They were able to befuddle a third of the world with this.</p><p>
"Yes, all the dark forces were unable to do anything bad with our people on this island that is now called Russia.</p><p>
"But just fifteen hundred years ago, the last island fell asleep. Earthly civilization, the people who knew God, fell asleep, in order to awaken in a new, predawn reality.</p><p>
"The dark forces believed that they had succeeded in destroying its culture and knowledge and the aspirations of its soul for good. This is why they try in the present, too, to conceal from all people on Earth the history of the Russian people.</p><p>
"In fact, significantly more stands behind this. By concealing Russian history, which serves as a step into the beautiful world, in fact they are trying to conceal the happily living civilization of Earth: the culture, knowledge, and sense of knowing God of the happiest of civilizations, in which your forefathers lived."</p><p>
"Anastasia, wait. Can you recount in more detail, in simple, understandable language, everything about this extinct or, as you put it, sleeping civilization, and prove its existence?"</p><p>
"I can try by choosing simple words. But it would be a hundred times better if each person would try to see it himself."</p><p>
"But can each person really see what happened ten thousand years ago?"</p><p>
"Yes. Only different details to a different degree. Overall, though, each person can sense it and even see his forefathers and himself in that happy world."</p><p>
"How can each person do this? How can I do this, for example?"</p><p>
"It's all very simple. For starters, Vladimir, try just through your logic to evaluate and compare events known to you. As questions arise, you find answers to them yourself."</p><p>
"What do you mean by 'logic'? How can I learn by logic about Russia's history, for example? After all, you did say that Russian history and culture were destroyed and are hiding from all the people of the Earth. But how can I myself, and others, too, verify what you say using only our logic?"</p><p>
"Let's try to reason together. I will help you touch history just a little."</p><p>
"Let's. What should I do for starters?"</p><p>
"Just answer your own question."</p><p>
"Which one?"</p><p>
"The simple one. Here, Vladimir, you brought a history textbook for our son. It's called 'The History of the Ancient World.' It has chapters that talk about the history of Ancient Rome, Greece, and China. It tells what Egypt was like five thousand years ago. But it doesn't say anything about Russia during that period. And it's not just the period five thousand years ago. It's also Russia's history and culture of one thousand years ago, which has been kept hidden in strictest secret. The textbook is written in Russian and intended for Russian children, but there isn't a word about Russia of even two thousand years ago. Why?"</p><p>
"Why? It's true, this is a very strange situation. A Russian textbook on the history of the ancient world actually says nothing about Russia. It says nothing about the life of the Russian people not only during the period of Ancient Rome and Egypt but also even later history. It's strange, very strange, as if there were no Russian people then."</p><p>
Trying to recall everything I knew about history, I recalled hearing about the existence of the ancient philosophers of Rome, Greece, and China. I hadn't read their works, just heard. I also knew that society had recognized their works as outstanding, brilliant. But nothing came to mind about a single Russian philosopher or poet of that period. Why not?</p><p>
Realizing that Anastasia wanted me to try to answer the question myself, I said, "Neither I nor anyone else can answer this question, Anastasia. It probably can't be answered."</p><p>
"It can. Only you can't be lazy about reasoning logically. After all, the first conclusion has been drawn: Not only the world, but even Russians do not know the history of the Russian people. Do you agree with this, Vladimir?"</p><p>
"Well, maybe not entirely known. Everything that happened a thousand years ago has been described."</p><p>
"Described with tremendous distortion and under censorship. In addition, the commentaries for all events are identical. Ancient Russia's last thousand years are like one day in history. It is the Christian period. But today, too, there is Christianity in Russia. Can you tell me what there was before it?"</p><p>
"Before it they say Russia was pagan. People worshiped various gods. But it's talked about very casually. We don't know of any writings in that period, and there aren't any legends. We don't have a description of the state structure or the people's way of life."</p><p>
"Here you've drawn a second conclusion: the Russian people had a different culture. Now, to follow your logic, tell me, in what instance do people try to hide or discredit history?"</p><p>
"Well, it's clear in what instance they try to falsify history. That's when they need to prove the advantage of the new order, the new power, the new civilization. But concealing even a mention of it—that's incredible!"</p><p>
"The incredible happened, Vladimir. This fact is indisputable. Now tell me, too, don't be lazy, please. Think. Did this fact come about on its own or as the result of someone's intentional efforts?"</p><p>
"Judging from the fact that books have always been burned in bonfires when people wanted to destroy knowledge or an ideology, it was no accident that someone destroyed all the knowledge of Russian culture in the pre-Christian period."</p><p>
"Who do you think that was?"</p><p>
"Probably whoever inculcated the new culture and religion in Old Russia."</p><p>
"You could put it that way. But wasn't there also someone controlling the new religion and those who inculcated it? And didn't he have his own goal?"</p><p>
"But who? Who can control religion? Tell me!"</p><p>
"Again you're searching for an answer from without and are too lazy to search for it in yourself. I can answer, but what is outside of you will seem incredible and give rise to doubt. Inside himself, having emancipated his soul and logic and awakened from his dream just a little, each person can hear the answer himself."</p><p>
"But I'm not lazy. Only it will take a long time for me to seek it out. Why don't you tell me yourself what you know about history. Where I have doubts, I'll ask more questions. I won't listen to your story like dogma but will immediately and later verify everything by logic, as you ask."</p><p>
"As you like. But I will only show you the broad strokes. Let each person try to draw and imagine the historical picture himself. He needs try to determine the reality of the present day, the past, and the future by himself alone, with his own soul."</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0605>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>5. The History of Humanity, as told by Anastasia</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Vedism</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>People have been living on Earth for billions of years. Everything on Earth was created perfectly from the beginning: the trees, grass, and bees, and the entire animal world.</p><p>
All that exists has a connection with the entire Universe. The pinnacle of all creations is man, and he was created harmonious in the great initial harmony.</p><p>
Man's purpose is to know everything around him and to create something beautiful in the Universe, to make a semblance of the earthly world in other galaxies, and in each new co-creation to offer up his beautiful something to the earthly creation.</p><p>
Paths will be open to co-creation by man on other planets when man can overcome temptations and hold the great energies of the Universe in unity, so that neither of them is allowed to dominate over the others.</p><p>
The day when all the Earth becomes a heavenly garden will signal the opening of the path of creation in the Universe. Once man has comprehended the Earth's full harmony, he will be able to add his own beautiful something.</p><p>
Man himself will tally the results of his actions once every million years lived. If he made a mistake, if he allowed just one energy of the many inside him to predominate, thereby reducing the others, then a disaster occurred on Earth. Then everything happened all over again. So it has been many times.</p><p>
One period of humanity, defined as a million years, is divided internally into three periods. The first is Vedian. The second is Image. The third is Occult.</p><p>
</p><p>The first period of life of human society on Earth, the Vedian, lasts nine hundred and ninety thousand years, during which man lives in paradise, like a happy child growing up under his parents' care.</p><p>
During the Vedian period, God is known by man. This is why it is called "Vedian," because the Slavic root "ved" refers to knowing. All of God's feelings are present in man, and through them man is capable of knowing any advice from God. If man suddenly makes a mistake, God is free to correct it, without violating the harmony, without infringing on man's freedom, merely by offering a hint.</p><p>
Vedian man does not wonder who created the world, the Universe, the galaxies, and their beautiful planet—Earth!—or how. All men know that everything around them, the visible and invisible, has been created by their Father, God.</p><p>
The Father is everywhere! Everything growing and living around us is His living thought and His program. You can interact with the Father's thought through your own, and you can even improve His program. All that's required is to first understand it in detail.</p><p>
Man did not worship God, and the many religions that arose subsequently did not exist in the Vedian period. There was the culture of life. The way of life became divine for people.</p><p>
Diseases of the flesh did not exist. Nourishing himself from God's bounty and arraying himself in God's clothing, man did not think about food and clothing. His mind was otherwise engaged. His thought was carried away by admiration for his discoveries. Human society had no rulers, and the borders that divide the different states today did not exist.</p><p>
Human society on Earth consisted of happy families. Families lived on different continents. Everyone was united by their desire to create a beautiful dimension.</p><p>
Many discoveries were made, and each family, after discovering something beautiful, felt a need to share it with others.</p><p>
The energy of Love shaped families, and each knew that the new family would create yet another very beautiful oasis on their home planet.</p><p>
There were many rituals, holidays, and carnivals among the Vedian people. Each celebration was filled with great meaning, sensitivity, and an awareness of the real earthly Divine existence.</p><p>
Each ritual was a great school and a great examination for the person who took part in it — an examination before people, before themselves, and, therefore, before God as well.</p><p>
I will recount and show you one of them: the ritual of the wedding or, rather, the recognition of the union of two people in love. Look. Compare that level of knowledge and culture with modern times.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Union of Two People: The Wedding</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>The wedding ritual, which secures the union of two people, came about with the participation of the entire settlement. Sometimes several settlements took part in it— neighboring and occasionally even distant settlements.</p><p>
The two future lovers met in various ways. Sometimes, young inhabitants of the same settlement might come to love each other. But more often, at one of the settlements' common holidays, two people's eyes would meet, and feelings would blaze up in their hearts.</p><p>
He would approach her or she him—it didn't matter. The two people's gazes could tell each other a lot. But there were words as well, and in translation into modern language they sounded approximately like this:</p><p>
"With you, beautiful goddess, I could create a dimension of Love for the ages," he would tell his chosen one.</p><p>
If the girl's heart responded with love, she would reply: "My god, I am prepared to help you in the great co-creation."</p><p>
Then the lovers would choose their own living place for their future home together.</p><p>
Together they would go to the outskirts of the settlement where he lived with his parents and then next to the settlement where she lived. The lovers did not need to inform their parents of their intentions. In the settlements, each person understood and knew of the impending event in the following way.</p><p>
When the lovers, in accord, decided on the place where they would live, they often secluded themselves together.</p><p>
Sometimes they would spend the night in the open air or in a shelter they built, greet the dawn, and spend the day. They would return to their parents' homes briefly and hurry back to their own place. It called to them and drew them, the way an infant inexplicably draws to himself his loving parents.</p><p>
The parents did not ask the young lovers questions. They merely waited for questions from their children with trembling and great joy, seeing their son or daughter abiding in deep contemplation.</p><p>
The children would leave once again for their great seclusion. This might go on for months, a year, or two. All this time there was no physical intimacy between the lovers.</p><p>
In Vedian settlements, people knew that the two lovers' hearts were creating a great plan and that the energy of Love was inspiring them.</p><p>
He and she, having taken in from their parents since infancy their culture of daily life, knowledge, and comprehension of Vedian culture, could tell as well about the star burning in the sky at night, and the flower that opens its petals with the sun's rising, and the purpose of the bee, and the energies abiding in their dimension.</p><p>
He and she, having gazed since infancy upon the beautiful homesteads, oases, and heavenly gardens their parents created in love, now strove to create their own.</p><p>
On the plot of chosen land, measuring a hectare or more, the lovers planned their practical life. They had to mentally plan their home and place the many plants so that everything interacted with and helped everything else.</p><p>
They lay out their garden so that it grew by itself, requiring no physical effort from man. Many nuances had to be taken into account in doing this: the alignment of the planets, the movement of air streams every day.</p><p>
In spring and summer, plants give off fragrances and secrete ethers. The lovers tried to lay out the plants together in such a way that when a breeze blew into their home, a bouquet made up of many different ethers would waft through.</p><p>
In this way, an unprecedented complex was conceived. It consisted of Divine creations. In addition, the place chosen by the lovers was supposed to be transformed into a beautiful picture pleasing to the eye. Not on canvas but on the living earth, a living picture was created in their thoughts for the ages.</p><p>
Today, too, man can picture, as thought carries him away and concentrates, when they try to plan their own home.</p><p>
Summer people will understand how, especially in spring, one can get carried away by thoughts of the future of one's plot.</p><p>
In thinking through his future picture, a talented painter also knows how much his thoughts can carry him away.</p><p>
All these aspirations were concentrated in the two loving hearts. Their knowledge of the energy of Love strengthened, giving birth to inspiration.</p><p>
This is why they did not even think about what today is called carnal pleasure.</p><p>
When their plan was completed in their thoughts, the lovers went first to the settlement where the groom lived and stopped at each house. The owners invited them in. Their arrival was awaited with excitement in each home.</p><p>
People of the Vedian culture knew that when the lovers came, a new energy of Divine Love would visit their homestead, if only for an instant, and the beautiful dimension of each homestead would smile upon the young love. This is not an invention or occult belief. After all, even now everyone likes it when a good-natured person is nearby, not an angry one.</p><p>
Lovers cannot be angry, especially when they come to see you together.</p><p>
But there was also excitement in each family of the settlement. When the young couple visited an orchard, a garden, or a house, they said a few words to their hosts. Just one sentence to each. Something like this: "Oh, how beautiful your apple tree is," or "The kitten has an intelligent look," or "You have a tactful bear working for you."</p><p>
For each person who heard the lovers' praise for the tree growing in their orchard or for the cat that lived with them, this meant recognition of the worthy life of the older generation by the younger. The opinion was always sincere. After all, the praiser's sentence meant that he would like to have a tree or bear like that.</p><p>
With pride and great joy, in front of the entire settlement, each would try to give the young people what they had honored with their praise. People looked forward impatiently to the day the young people had set so they could bring their gift.</p><p>
Now the young people went from house to house in the bride's settlement. Sometimes it would take three days to visit the homesteads in the two settlements. Sometimes it would take more than a week. When the young people had completed their circuit of the homesteads and set the appointed day for everyone, the guests, old and young, would come from the two settlements at dawn.</p><p>
The people would stand on the perimeter of the parcel of land the young people had marked off with dry branches. In the center, next to the shelter, a mound would rise from the ground decorated with flowers.</p><p>
Look and you'll see an unusual picture now!</p><p>
There it is! Look! The young man is coming out before the inhabitants of the two settlements. He is as beautiful as Apollo. Fair-haired and blue-eyed, he has climbed the mound. He is excited, Radomir—that is the youth's name—standing before you. The gazes of all those gathered are aimed at him alone. In the ensuing silence he begins his speech.</p><p>
He sets forth before everyone his plan for the new dimension created with his beloved. Radomir recounts, gesturing with his hand, where the apple tree will grow, the cherry tree, and the pear tree, where the grove of pine, oak, cedar, and alder will be, what berry-sprinkled bushes should grow between them, what grasses will give off their aromas, how easily the bees can build their home in the little woods, and where the hard-working bear will sleep in winter.</p><p>
He speaks very quickly and with inspiration, setting forth what he has contemplated. His speech lasts approximately three hours. The people will listen to him with bated attention and excitement the entire time. Each time the youth points to a place where a plant is supposed to grow according to his grandiose plan, a person steps out of the circle of people listening to him and stands in the place where the apple tree, or pear tree, or cherry tree will grow. Sometimes a woman steps out, a man, or an old man. But a child might step out, too, his eyes filled with comprehension, wisdom, and joyous satisfaction.</p><p>
People step out of the circle holding the sapling of the very plant the youth has named and pointed to the place where this beautiful thing should grow.</p><p>
And the people bowed to each person stepping out of the circle. After all, whoever stepped out was awarded the young people's praise when they went around to the homesteads for being able to raise something beautiful. Thus, whoever stepped out was worthy of the praise of the Creator, the Father of all, the God who loves everyone.</p><p>
This conclusion was not drawn by superstition. It is logical.</p><p>
People of the Vedian culture treated the young lovers creating a plan for a beautiful oasis like gods. Their attitude was justified.</p><p>
The Creator had created in a surge of inspiration and love, and the young people had created their beautiful project, also inspired by love.</p><p>
Look, the youth has finished his story, come down from the rise, and gone over to where his young woman is standing, following all that was going on with excitement and awe. He takes her by the hand and draws her onto the rise. Now they are standing on the rise together.</p><p>
The youth says before all: "I have not created the dimension of Love here alone. By my side and before you is my beautiful inspiration."</p><p>
At first the young woman—or, more precisely, virgin—lowered her gaze before everyone.</p><p>
Each woman has her own beauty, but there can be moments in the life of each woman when she rises above everyone. There are no such moments in present-day culture. But in those days . . .</p><p>
Look! Lyubomila, as the girl who climbed the hill was called, has aimed her gaze at the people. A cry of admiration from all the people standing before her merged into one. A bold but not impudent smile shone on the girl's face. The energy of Love had filled her to overflowing. The flush on her cheeks played more than usual. The girl's body, bursting with health, and the vividness of her eyes enveloped the people and everything in the dimension around them in warmth. For a moment, everything around them fell still. The young goddess shone before the people in all her beauty.</p><p>
This is why the girl's parents did not approach the rise where the lovers stood right away but gradually, accompanied by the elder and younger members of their entire family. Stopping at the rise, the family first bowed to the young people, and then the mother asked the young woman, her daughter,</p><p>
"All the wisdom of our family is in you. Tell us, my daughter, do you see the future of the land you have chosen?"</p><p>
"Yes, Mama, I do," the daughter answered.</p><p>
"Tell me, my daughter," the mother continued. "Do you like everything shown you from the future?"</p><p>
The young virgin could answer this question in different ways. Most often, "Yes, Mama. Here there will be a heavenly, beautiful garden and a living house."</p><p>
Here, though, look. The spirited girl with the flush playing on her cheeks gave a nontraditional answer to her mother's question in front of everyone.</p><p>
"The plan set forth is not bad, and it is to my soul's liking. Still, I want to add a little something of my own."</p><p>
Leaping quickly from the rise, the maiden suddenly ran between the people to the edge of the future garden. She stopped and spoke:</p><p>
"Here a tree with needles should grow, and next to it a birch. When a breeze blows from that direction, it will encounter the pine's branches and then the birch's, and then the breeze will ask the branches of the orchard's trees to sing a melody. It would never be exactly the same, but each time it would be a delectation for the soul. And here"—the maiden ran off a little to the side—"here flowers should grow. I want the red color to blaze first, here violet a little later, and here claret."</p><p>
The maiden, her cheeks as flushed as a fairy's, danced around her future garden. And once again the rest of the people in the circle went into motion, hurrying, carrying seeds to those points on the ground the ardent maiden had specified.</p><p>
Finished with her dance, she once again ran to the rise, and standing next to her chosen one, said, "Now the dimension here will be beautiful. The earth will cultivate a wondrous picture."</p><p>
"Tell all the people, my daughter"—the mother addressed the maiden again—"who will be the crown on this most beautiful dimension? Who, of all the people living on Earth, could you crown with your own hand?"</p><p>
The maiden scanned the people standing around her holding saplings and seeds. Each of them was standing in the spot indicated by the youth who had set forth his plan and the girl who had drawn the beautiful picture. But no one planted a seed in the earth. The sacred moment had not yet come. Now the maiden turned toward the youth standing by her side on the rise and said these words in a singing voice:</p><p>
"He is worthy of accepting the crown whose thought is able to create a beautiful future."</p><p>
At these words the girl touched the shoulder of the youth standing by her side. He dropped to one knee before her. And the girl placed a beautiful crown woven of fragrant grasses by her maidenly hand on his head. Then she ran her right hand over her crowned man's hair three times while inclining his head a little with her left. Then she gave a signal and the youth rose from his knee. The girl ran down from the rise and bowed her head slightly in submission.</p><p>
In that moment the father, who towered over everyone, walked toward the crown-bearing youth, accompanied by the entire family. Approaching the rise, the father halted in respect, paused, and then spoke, turning his gaze to his son.</p><p>
"Who are you whose thought is capable of creating a dimension of Love?"</p><p>
And the youth replied, "I am your son, and I am the Creator's son."</p><p>
"A crown has been laid upon you, the portent of a great mission. What will you do, you crown bearer, having power over this dimension of yours?"</p><p>
"I will create a beautiful future."</p><p>
"Where will you take the strength and inspiration, my son and crown-bearing son of the Creator?"</p><p>
"In Love!"</p><p>
"The energy of Love is capable of roaming throughout the Universe. How will you be able to see the reflection of universal love on Earth?"</p><p>
"There is a certain young woman, father, and for me she is the reflection of the energy of universal Love on Earth." At these words, the youth descended toward the young woman, took her by the hand, and led her up the rise.</p><p>
They held hands and watched the two families merge into a group, embrace, joke, and laugh, the little children and the old people alike. Once again, everything fell silent when the youth raised his hand over his head and proclaimed, "Thank you everyone who has heard me. My soul has told you of the creation of a new dimension. Thank you to everyone who has known the energy of Love. May what has been contemplated by the soul's dream sprout from the earth!"</p><p>
These words caused the people standing around to move joyfully. They planted the seeds and saplings with pride, joy, and great awe. Each planted just one sapling in the place where the youth had indicated. Those who had not been shown where to plant walked along the perimeter of the previously marked-out plot and, singing in chorus, sowed the seeds they had brought into the ground.</p><p>
Just a few minutes had passed and a marvelous garden had been planted, a dimension created by a dream.</p><p>
The people once again stepped back behind the plot's line. Only two families surrounded the rise where he and she, the lovers, were standing.</p><p>
Raindrops fell on the land. It was an unusual and brief, very warm rain, as if the Creator's eyes were dropping tears of joy and tenderness and washing the beautiful dimension His children had created.</p><p>
What could be dearer for a parent than his children's wondrous creation?</p><p>
Once again the crowned youth raised his hand over his head and in the silence said, "May the creatures given to man by the Creator live alongside us in friendship."</p><p>
The youth and maiden came down from the rise and headed toward the shelter where they had dwelt when they were completing their plan.</p><p>
After these words, a man stepped out of the circle surrounding the young people, and walked toward them with an old dog and a puppy by his side. It was the dog that the young people had noticed in their circle of visits and had liked very much.</p><p>
The man bowed and presented the puppy to the bride. He gave the old dog a command, and it lay at the feet of the youth with the crown. This dog had been trained so that it helped man train all the other animals.</p><p>
He ordered the dog to sit at the youth's entrance, and the maiden let the puppy into the shelter. Other people came up to the shelter, one after the other, carrying a kitten or a lamb, or bringing a foal or bear by a lead.</p><p>
People quickly built a wattle enclosure against the shelter, and soon after, the lodging where people had so recently slept was filled with young animals. There was great sense in this. Having mingled among themselves, they would live in friendship forever and take care of and help each other. This is not mysticism, this is the law of the Creator's nature. After all, even today, one can be convinced of this. When a puppy and kitten are raised together, they remain friends when they are grown.</p><p>
The Vedian period was also characterized by the fact that people knew the purpose of the various creatures, and all animals served man.</p><p>
Man did not worry about feeding the animals; they fed him. During the Vedian period, domestic animals and man were vegetarian, never ate meat, and could not even contemplate that kind of food. The diversity of what grew around them could delight the taste of man and the animals living beside him in abundance.</p><p>
In this case, too, people from the two settlements brought the young people the best they had.</p><p>
After accepting the gifts, the young people once again climbed the rise.</p><p>
"Thank you, everyone," the crowned groom thanked those gathered. "Thank you, everyone, for creating the dimension. It will protect my family down through the ages."</p><p>
"Thank you to the mothers who gave birth to a creator," said the bride. Turning to the youth, she added, "To the joy of the Creator of the Sun, the Moon, the scattering of stars, and the beautiful Earth, we will create everything you can contemplate."</p><p>
"With you, beautiful goddess, and with the people," the youth replied to the bride and added, "You alone are capable of inspiring my dreams."</p><p>
The young couple again descended from the rise, and the family of each surrounded them with congratulations.</p><p>
The people, dancing around the plot, began to sing a joyous song.</p><p>
It was already evening. Each of the young people went to their own house with their relatives. They now would not see each other for two nights and one day.</p><p>
Coming home, having expended great strength on creation, the youth-creator would fall into a deep sleep. The beautiful virgin bride would fall asleep in her own bed.</p><p>
The people who stayed where the creation in love had taken place would sing songs in round dances, and while the couples went off to be alone, the older people would resurrect pleasant memories about how all this happened for them on a day like this.</p><p>
The best artisans from the two villages, in a day of songs and round dances, would erect a small house by laying logs on top of one another. Among the logs, they placed mosses and bouquets of fragrant herbs. The next day the women of the village would put the best fruits in the new house. The two mothers would cover the bed with linen. On the second night, every single person would leave the plot.</p><p>
After sleeping through the first night, the young groom would wake up when the Sun rose above the land and joyfully illuminated his parents' home. His first thought would be of his crown. He would take it and put it on his head, smiling at everyone blissfully.</p><p>
Accompanied by his brothers and sisters, he would go to the stream to wash in spring water. Walking through the garden to the house, Radomir would see his mother.</p><p>
The mother would admire her son with a concealed smile.</p><p>
The youth, full of energy, would not be able to contain himself and would rejoice at the sight of his own mother. He would pick her up, exulting, and spin her around like a child and exclaim, "How beautiful life around us is, Mama, Mama!"</p><p>
"Oh!" his mother would exclaim, and she would laugh. Hiding his face, his grandfather would smile. His grandmother, carrying a handsome carved ladle, would come up to the exulting people to say, "Our young god, stop. Safeguard your triumphant energy. Drink an infusion of calming herbs so your energy doesn't burn up. Its time will come one night from now.</p><p>
Then the youth drank the infusion and began to talk with his grandfather about the meaning of life and the Universe. Soon after, the infusion would make him sleepy. The youth, his grandmother's "young god," would fall sound asleep on the embroidered bedspread.</p><p>
What is going on? Why did the grandmother call her grandson a god? Was she exaggerating, admiring her grandson in her exultation? Not a bit! After all, her grandson had performed deeds worthy of God's name.</p><p>
God created the Earth and everything that grows and lives on it, and the youth, having taken in all the knowledge of his ancestors, had recognized the purpose of the many creations, to the Creator's great joy. Determining the purpose of the many creations, he created from them a most beautiful, living oasis capable of bringing the joy of life to him, his beloved, the generation of their children, and the people who would gaze upon this most beautiful creation of love down through the ages.</p><p>
What human deeds on Earth could be more pleasing to God? What could a man who has lived one human life on Earth do that is best and most important?</p><p>
The Vedian wedding celebration is not an occult ritual. There is great and real meaning in it, an aspiration to be akin to Divine being.</p><p>
By showing people his aspirations and knowledge, the youth in love took a kind of exam before the people. By his act, he showed that the knowledge of all the generations from the primary source was in him, but he brought something of his own as well. All the people appreciated his creation for its worth, and they planted trees and herbs in their appointed place with great joy. This beautiful, joint creation would bloom more and more beautifully with each spring.</p><p>
Yet envy would not arise in a single neighbor from its contemplation. After all, each put his own effort into its creation. Each has a shoot planted by him in this beautiful place. If these kinds of homesteads would multiply, the Earth would be garbed in a blooming, Divine garden. In Vedian culture each knew that man is given eternal life, that beautiful life is repeated when there is a desire for what is beautiful in what is living!</p><p>
Homesteads! The Vedian culture's homesteads! After all, it is they that would subsequently be called paradise in occult books. Losing the great knowledge, one can believe that one can see it only in the expanses beyond the clouds—all this in order to exalt what is called advanced modern science, to justify what is in fact merely a poverty of thinking.</p><p>
Such a dispute is meaningless without actions, and the actions to resolve the disputes can be simple. For example, let all the respected scientific luminaries today try to create just one single oasis for one family and at the same time carry out the tasks each Vedian youth in love dealt with.</p><p>
A homestead where a happy family will live should satisfy the food requirements of everyone living on it every hour.</p><p>
A proper homestead should not permit illness to even begin. It should gratify man's gaze by the minute by altering the reality in the scene. It should please the ear with a diversity of sounds, and the smell with the fragrances of flowering.</p><p>
It should provide the nourishment of ethers for the soul, be nurse to the child, and preserve love forever. At the same time, the members of the entire family should expend no effort, and their thinking should remain free. All people have been given thought for creating.</p><p>
The scientific world takes pride in what is illusory:</p><p>
"Look, rockets are speeding into space for the good of people." Is it really for their good?</p><p>
"Look, bombs are exploding for your defense." Really for our defense?</p><p>
"Look, the educated doctor is saving your life." But before this your life was being destroyed every minute by daily life. They save the slave's life in order to prolong his agony.</p><p>
The scientific world is incapable of creating even a semblance of a beautiful homestead as well because there is the law of the Universe. The one Creator, inspired by love, is stronger than all the sciences, which lack love.</p><p>
The crown-bearing youth slept soundly the second night. Nothing disturbed him. Only his favorite image of stars sparkled and shone. In his sleep, he identified with his co-created dimension, its mightiness, and universal diversity.</p><p>
Radomir awoke before dawn. Without waking anyone, putting on his crown, he took the shirt his mother had embroidered for him. He ran to the stream in order to gather water from the spring.</p><p>
The moon lit his predawn path, and garlands of stars still blinked high above. After washing in the stream, he put on his shirt and quickly started toward his cherished creation. The heavens shone.</p><p>
Here he stands, alone, on the spot where the two villages had celebrated exultantly so recently, the place he had created with his thought.</p><p>
One cannot convey the power of the feelings and sensations in a person at a moment like this to anyone who has never once experienced the like.</p><p>
One might say, Divine sensations and feelings arose in the person, and they mounted with the anxious anticipation of the ray of dawn in which . . . Here she is! His most beautiful Lyubomila! Illuminated by the dawn's ray, she was running to meet him and to their co-creation.</p><p>
The vision in flesh was racing toward Radomir. There is no limit to perfection, of course, but suddenly time stopped for the two of them. In a fog of emotions, they entered their new house. Food lay on the table, and the alluring fragrance of dry flowers rose from the embroidered cover on the bed.</p><p>
"What are you thinking about right now?" she asked him in an ardent whisper.</p><p>
"About him. About our future child." And Radomir shuddered looking at Lyubomila. "Oh, how beautiful you are!" Unable to restrain himself, he very cautiously touched her shoulder and cheek.</p><p>
The hot breath of Love enveloped the two and carried them off to unknown heights.</p><p>
No one millions of years hence could describe in detail what happens to the man and woman when in a surge of mutual love, merging into one for co-creation, they bring about their own likeness and God's.</p><p>
But the Vedian people-gods knew exactly when the inexplicable miracle takes place, joining the two, each of whom subsequently each remain himself and herself. At the same time, at an inexplicable moment, the Universe shudders at the sight of this vision: the infant's soul making its way on its little legs, barefoot, from star to star, rushing toward Earth, embodying two people and a third into one.</p><p>
The act of crowning the union of two lovers in the Vedian period of people's life cannot be categorized as occult. It is rational. It corresponded to their way of life. The constantly mounting feeling of love for one another in each family pair spoke to the level of this culture.</p><p>
Today, love for one another almost always dies out between married partners. The energy of Love abandons them, and this is accepted by the human community as proper. But that situation is unnatural for man. It speaks as well to the fact that the way of life among present-day people is unnatural.</p><p>
Lovers of the Vedian period understood with their heart and soul rather than their mind that when the emotions of love blaze up, this is a call to Divine co-creation.</p><p>
You must notice what the lovers initially aspired to. Together, in a burst of inspiration, they mentally created a plan. A plan for the dimension of their love. In the dimension they co-created, they conceived a child. The three main feelings of love were combined into one eternal something. After all, inexplicably to himself, man loves his native place most of all his whole life—his homeland, his child and the woman with whom all this was co-created. Only the three feelings of love, not just one, can live eternally.</p><p>
The birth of a son or daughter in a Vedian family was also a magnificent holiday and ritual with vital meaning. There were many other celebrations in those times and no marital infidelity. Millions of happy families adorned the Earth. It was later that today's succession of historians fawning before the rulers would say that primitive man was once foolish. He killed animals, ate their meat in a frenzy, and wore their hides. Whoever tries to justify the monstrosity of his own actions needs to tell this monstrous lie.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Childrearing in the Vedian Culture</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"Humanity is still searching for the perfect system of childrearing, still trying to find the wisest teachers and hand their children over to them to educate. And you, Vladimir, preparing for your conversation with our son, spent five years searching for the best childrearing system. A system capable of explaining everything to you and teaching you how to interact with your own child. You kept asking for advice from recognized teachers and various scientists, but no one piece of advice and no one system satisfied you or seemed perfect. Doubts arose in you more and more often: 'If there were only one perfect system for raising children, many people would certainly take advantage of it. A happy people might have lived somewhere on Earth. But all the countries have only similar and different problems. Finding a happy family is like finding a needle in a haystack. This means there is no miracle-working system for raising children, and my searches have been futile since there is nothing to search for.'</p><p>
"Forgive me, please, while not finding any other solution at the time, I was constantly following your thinking. Through you, I tried to understand what leads people away from the obvious.</p><p>
"One day, I sensed your thought: 'Lack of faith and fear at one's own mistake force people to hand their children over to schools and academies so that later they can reproach the teachers instead of themselves.'</p><p>
"One day I saw you turn pale and freeze when this thought arose in you: 'Children are educated by the way of life of their parents and society.' This thought was true and accurate. But it scared you, and you kept trying to forget it. However, you couldn't forget the obvious.</p><p>
"Later you tried to disagree with your own thinking. You reasoned as follows: 'How can one become a scientist, artist, or poet? How can one learn mathematics or astronomy without studying in a special school?'</p><p>
"But you were thinking about subject knowledge, and that is not the main thing in childrearing.</p><p>
"A culture of emotions capable of squeezing all knowledge into a kernel is immeasurably more important. You could have understood all this since you yourself are such a vivid confirmation of what I've said. After all, you were able to write a book without studying in a special school.</p><p>
"You and I spent just three days in the glade together, and now you are a writer famous in different countries. You can go out on stage before a hall filled with people—among them teachers, scientists, poets, and famous healers. You can speak before them for three hours if you like, and people listen to you with great attention. People often ask you, 'How can you keep in your memory information whose volume is unlimited, how can you recite pages from books from memory without a piece of paper?' You answered questions like these vaguely. But privately you decided that I had acted upon you with unprecedented spells. In fact, everything was much simpler with you.</p><p>
"When you spent those first three days in the taiga with me, the Vedian school was simultaneously having its influence on you all three days. It is neither intrusive nor obtrusive, and it has no treatises or postulates. It is capable of conveying all its information by means of feelings.</p><p>
"You were angry, you were delighted and laughed, you were frightened. And with each new feeling, information entered you. Its great volume has been revealed subsequently, as you have recalled the feelings that arose in you during those days.</p><p>
"After all, emotions are an enormous quantity of concentrated information. The more vivid and powerful an emotion, the more universal knowledge there is in it.</p><p>
"For example, remember when you awoke the first night in the taiga and saw the bear next to you? You were instantly frightened. Please note and think about this: 'instantly frightened.' But what is fear? Let us try to translate it into information. What do we get then? You thought, 'Next to me is an enormous forest beast. Its weight exceeds my body's weight significantly. The strength of his paws is greater than the strength of my arms. A forest beast can be aggressive. It could attack me and tear my body apart. I'm unarmed. I need to jump and run away.'</p><p>
"All this enormous volume of information during conscious reasoning takes up not one instant but significantly more time. But the information squeezed into an emotion—in this case, fear—allows you to react to the situation instantly. In the one instant of experiencing a vivid emotion, a large volume of information passes through a person. Its description results in a scientific treatise whose emotionless comprehension could take years.</p><p>
"The correct totality of emotions and their proper sequence can increase the volume of knowledge a person has multifold.</p><p>
"For example, your fear of the bear passed instantly, too. But why did it? This is unnatural, after all. You were still in the taiga, and you were still unarmed. The bear had not gone far away, and there might have been many other beasts around.</p><p>
"But your fear was instantly replaced by a feeling of safety. You felt more protected than when you were on your ship or in town, surrounded by an armed guard.</p><p>
"The sense of being protected arose in you instantly as well. It happened as soon as you saw the bear happily carry out my commands, reacting to my words and gestures. This sense of protection gave you the opportunity to take in information in a new way. A detailed description of everything that is happening to you could take up quite a few pages of an entire treatise. In your books, too, you devoted quite a few words to the animals' attitude toward man. But this theme is infinite. Yet it is folded into a feeling in one instant.</p><p>
"Something even more important happened, however. In just a few seconds, two opposite feelings came into absolute balance. You saw me as a person next to whom you felt totally protected while at the same time incomprehensible and a little frightening.</p><p>
"The balance of emotions is very important. It attests to the person's balance and at the same time, as if constantly pulsating, emotions give birth to more and more new streams of information.</p><p>
"The culture and way of life of each family of the Vedian civilization and the way of life of the entire human community were the greatest school for educating the upcoming generation, for intensively perfecting man, for advancing him toward creation in the worlds of the vast Universe.</p><p>
"During the Vedian age, children were not raised the way they are in modern schools, but through participation in cheerful holidays and rituals. These were the holidays of a single family or those in which people of the entire settlement, or even several located nearby, took part.</p><p>
"To put it even more precisely, the many Vedian holidays were both a serious exam for children and adults and a medium for the exchange of information.</p><p>
"The way of life in the family and the preparations for these holidays provided the opportunity for acquiring a huge systemic volume of knowledge.</p><p>
"Knowledge was passed on to the child without the kind of force when he, against his will, is made to sit and listen to a teacher. The teaching process for the parents and their children went on every minute, cheerfully and unobtrusively. It was welcome and entertaining.</p><p>
"However, it also included methods unusual for the present day. Not knowing their huge significance for teaching man, today's scholars might call such parental methods superstitious or occult.</p><p>
"For example, you too thought this and were indignant when you saw a mighty eagle snatch our tiny, still defenseless son, before he could stand. It held the baby in its talons and circled first high and then low over the glade.</p><p>
"Something similar was done with children in all Vedian families. They did not always call on eagles for this purpose. One can show an infant the earth from high above from a mountain top, if there is such a mountain near your home. Sometimes a father would take his tiny child and climb to the top of a tall tree. They might build a tower especially for this purpose. Nonetheless, the effect was greater when the eagle circled the infant above the earth. At that moment, a great deal of knowledge rushed into the infant, who experienced a whole spectrum of emotions, so that once he grew up, when he wanted to, when the need arose, he could discover this knowledge inside him through his feelings.</p><p>
"For example, you must remember I showed you how the handsome Radomir created the most perfect plan for a homestead with his bride Lyubomila. I told you then that the most able modern scientists could not create anything like it today, even if they all joined together.</p><p>
"But how could the youth complete such a miracle alone? Where did he get his knowledge of all the plants, the meaning of the winds, and the purpose of the planets and much else? After all, he didn't sit at an ordinary school bench. He did not study science. How did the youth learn the purpose of each of the five hundred thirty thousand species of plants? Of these, he used only nine thousand, but at the same time he precisely defined each one's connection to the others.</p><p>
"Of course, Radomir had seen his father's homestead and his neighbors' since he was a child. But he didn't write anything down, after all, and did not make an effort to memorize them. He did not ask his parents what grew for what, and they did not besiege him with lectures. Nonetheless, the young Radomir, in love, created his own homestead, even better than his parents'.</p><p>
"Please don't be amazed, Vladimir! You must understand. After all, Radomir did not in fact build an orchard and a rational garden, even though that is what his homestead ended up having. In fact, through his feelings, Radomir drew a beautiful picture for his beloved and his future children, and his flight with the eagle over his homestead helped his enthusiasm for love and inspiration.</p><p>
"When the infant Radomir got a bird's-eye view of the landscape of that homestead, his subconscious took a picture, as if on film. He could not yet realize the picture as beautiful with his mind, but with his feelings! With his feelings he scanned all the diverse information of the dimension forever, and with his feelings, not his reason or his intellect, he sensed what he had seen as beautiful.</p><p>
"This also happened because his smiling mama was standing in the middle of the beautiful landscape seen from on high. What could be more beautiful for a baby than his mother's smile? She waved to him. She, in whose breast was life-giving, warm milk. For the infant, there is nothing more beautiful. From his bird's-eye view, everything little Radomir saw seemed inseparable from his mama, a single whole. In an instant, in a blaze of rapture, knowledge of a part of the world edifice appeared in him.</p><p>
"Young people in such modern sciences as zoology and agronomy, as well as astronomy, have shown great erudition. People have also appreciated their artistic taste.</p><p>
"Of course, there were special teachers during the Vedian period as well.</p><p>
"In the winter, elderly people who were especially wise in different sciences would come to the settlement. There was a common house in each settlement, and in it they elucidated their sciences. If one of the children who heard them suddenly expressed a special interest in astronomy, the teacher would go to the house of the child's parents. The teacher would be joyously received in that house. The scientist would talk with the child about the stars for as many days and hours as the child wanted, and you couldn't say who acquired more knowledge from whom in their conversations. After all, the elderly scientist would ask the child questions with great respect. He could debate with him without condescension. In the Vedian period, there was no point in recording discussions and their conclusions and discoveries. Free of the daily bustle and the many cares of the present day, the human memory could take in much more information than the best computer invented today.</p><p>
"In addition, the discoveries, if they were rational, served all the people immediately and were put into practice.</p><p>
"The parents and all the members of the household could listen to all the scientific discussions, too. They themselves sometimes tactfully joined the conversation. Nevertheless, the child was always paramount. When a young astronomer drew a conclusion about the planets that the adults considered wrong, they might say to him, 'Forgive me, I can't understand you.'</p><p>
"The child would try to explain a little more, and often it happened that the child would be right.</p><p>
"Before spring came, all the settlement's inhabitants would gather in the common house. They would all listen to their children's accomplishments. A six-year-old boy might amaze everyone, like a philosopher talking about the meaning of life. During those days, the children showed the people their marvelous handicrafts. Others would delight the hearing of those gathered with their singing or an unusual dance. The acts could be called an exam or a holiday for everyone—it doesn't matter. More importantly, everyone received joy from what was created. The string of positive emotions and the discoveries of these days were happily absorbed into life. How can one say who was most important in the child's upbringing? One can say confidently that it was the culture, the way of life of the families of the Vedian period.</p><p>
"What can we take from that culture for today's children? Which of the existing childrearing systems today can be deemed best? Judge for yourself. They are all imperfect. After all, having distorted human history, we have forced the children themselves to lie, forced their thought down a false path. Because we ourselves suffer, we force our children to suffer, too.</p><p>
"Above all, all people must learn the truth about themselves. A life without truth, in false postulates, is like a hypnotic dream.</p><p>
"The sequence of three pictures in children's textbooks need to be changed. We need to tell our children the history of the people who live on Earth truthfully. We must verify the truth of it ourselves and then choose a new path with our children when they have learned the undistorted essence.</p><p>
"The three pictures in children's books about the history of the Earth's development and the people living on it are not harmless. Look what the pictures instill in them from their early years.</p><p>
"Here is the first. It depicts primitive man. Look at what he's like. He is standing wearing a hide and wielding a club, he has savage bared teeth, his gaze is unintelligent, and he is amid the bones of beasts he has killed.</p><p>
"In the second, a man stands in armor with a sword, a shiny ornamental helmet. He and his army are subduing towns, and the slavish crowd has bowed down before him.</p><p>
"In the third, the man's gaze is intelligent, he is noble, he looks healthy, he is wearing a suit. Around him are many instruments and devices. Modern man is handsome and happy.</p><p>
"All three pictures are false, and their sequence is incorrect. They instill this entire lie in children persistently, strictly, and purposely. Later, I can say who does this and why he needs a lie like this. But first you must verify with your own logic how accurate these three pictures are.</p><p>
"Judge for yourself. You can see the trees, grasses, and bushes today in their primordial form. They are billions of years old. But even today, looking at them, you can admire their perfection.</p><p>
"What does all this speak to? The creators of this creation were created perfect from the beginning. And so? Did He make man, his favorite creation, ugly? That is untrue! Originally, man was the Creator's most perfect creation among the most beautiful creations on Earth.</p><p>
"Even the first picture should depict a historical truth. In it, we should see a family of the happiest people with an intelligent, childishly pure gaze. There is love on the two parents' faces. The human figures are in harmony with what surrounds them. They are striking for their beauty, and their spirit is striking for its god-sent power. An orchard blossoms all around. All the beasts are prepared to serve any of them instantly and gratefully.</p><p>
"The second picture should depict the full historical truth for children. In it, two armies in ugly armor are rushing at each other. The commanders stand on a rise. The priests admonish them. There is dismay and fear on the commanders' faces. In the faces of the others, who have already submitted to the admonishment, there is a brutal, fanatical look. In a moment, insane slaughter will begin. People will kill their like.</p><p>
"The third picture represents the day of present-day people. Here is a group of people, sickly and pale, in a room among many artificial things. Some are fat, others hunched over, their faces pensive and gloomy. You can see people like this among the majority of passers-by in the cities. Outside, on the street, cars are blowing up, and ash rains down from the sky.</p><p>
"All three truthful pictures from history should be shown to the child. We should ask him, 'Which kind of life do you want to choose?'</p><p>
"The pictures are merely conventional illustrations. Naturally, a sincere story, truthful and expert, is essential as well. The child should know all history and all the distortions of all the false doctrines. Only after this can his education begin. He must be asked, 'How can the present day be changed?'</p><p>
"The child will not find the answer right away, but he will indeed find it. A different, constructive thinking will begin. Oh, childrearing! You must understand, Vladimir. A sincere question alone and the desire to hear the answer from your own child can connect parents and children down through the ages and make them happy. Joint movement toward happiness is endless. But even its beginning can be called happiness.</p><p>
"All people must know their own history truthfully."</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Rituals</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"Occult priests subsequently put much effort into discrediting and distorting the meaning of the rituals of the Vedian era. For instance, a rumor was spread about how the Veds worshiped the water element recklessly. Even the best young women, who had not yet known love, were sacrificed annually. They were thrown into lakes or rivers, tied to a raft, and pushed away from shore, and so were condemned to death.</p><p>
"Many different acts truly were linked for the Veds with the water element, a lake or river, but their meaning was completely different. The rituals helped life, not death. I will tell you about just one. A semblance of it has even come down to the present day, but only a semblance. Today its great rational and poetic meaning has been replaced by opacity and occultism.</p><p>
"Various countries even today have a holiday connected with water, when they drop wreaths onto the water, or a small raft with a pretty lantern or candle, push it away from shore, and let it sail, while asking the water for luck. But look where this holiday comes from and how rational and poetic its primordial meaning is.</p><p>
"It so happened in Vedian times that one or two young women, it didn't matter, would not find themselves a beloved in their own settlement. During the great holiday for several settlements, they were unable to choose their intended. Not that the choice was limited. Before them, handsome youths with intelligent gazes such as gods have shone at the holiday events. But the maiden's heart and soul waited for someone else. Love did not visit them. The young woman was dreaming of someone, but whom? She herself did not understand. To this day, no one can explain the enigmatic arbitrariness of the energy of Love.</p><p>
"This is why on a certain day the young women went to the river. In a river cove, they would lower a small raft onto the water. They would decorate the raft with a garland of flowers along the edge. In the middle, they would put a small pitcher with a either a fruit drink or wine. They would place fruits around the pitcher. The young woman had to prepare the beverage herself, and she had to pick the fruits from trees she had planted with her own hand in her orchard. Also on the raft she could place a headband of woven flax fibers, or something else, but always something created by her own hands. Last, a small lamp was placed on the raft.</p><p>
"Around a fire burning on the shore, the young women danced their round dance and sang a song about the beloved they still did not know. Later, taking twigs burning in the fire, they lit the lamp wick. They pushed their little rafts out from the cove to where the current took over and gently carried them into the river's unknown distance.</p><p>
"The young women's gazes accompanied their little rafts with hope. From a distance only the lamps' little light could be seen, shrinking. But the light kindled hopes in the young women's hearts. A joyous, tender emotion grew for someone unknown.</p><p>
"The young women ran to their homes, secluded themselves, and waited with trepidation for their meeting. He would come, the welcome one, at dawn or sunset, it didn't matter. But how could he? What led him? Was it mysticism that abetted the meeting or rationality? Or perhaps it was knowledge that the Veds tapped into through their feelings. Judge for yourself.</p><p>
"After all, the maidens' little rafts went out, borne by the river's current, on specific days known in all the settlements, even distant ones.</p><p>
"They might journey a day, or two, or three. All those days and moonlit nights, youths who had not known love waited hopefully, in solitude, on the riverbanks.</p><p>
"Then they saw the lights in the distance, borne by the river current. And they dove right into the water and swam toward the lights of love. The most transparent stream of river water caressed rather than burned the youth's glowing body. The lights and outlines of the little rafts could be seen closer and closer, one more beautiful than the next. He would choose one of them. It's not clear why he considered his choice best?</p><p>
"He pulled the raft to shore from the middle, pushing it with his hand or touching its sides with his cheek. The river seemed to be using its current to play with him. But his body was filled with more and more strength, and the river's play went unnoticed. His thought was already on shore.</p><p>
"The youth carefully placed the little raft on the ground, blew the lamp out, tasted the drink elatedly, and quickly walked home to get ready for the road. The youth took everything lying on the raft with him. On his way, he tasted the fruits and delighted in their taste. Soon after, he arrived at the settlement where the raft had been sent, and found straightaway the orchard and tree whose fruits he had taken pleasure from on his way.</p><p>
"Oh, people might be amazed. How could all this come about without mysticism? How could the youths find their beloved so unerringly?</p><p>
"One might say that Love led them along a path known only to it. But I can simplify this: the lamp helped, too. Incisions had been made in the tiny saucer in which the floating wick burned. From it, anyone could easily determine how long the lamp's fire had been burning. The speed of the river's current was known as well. The puzzle was quite simple—and easily solved. Finding in the settlement the tree from which the fruits were picked was no trouble for a youth of the Vedian era at all.</p><p>
"Fruits can seem alike only to the inattentive person. The fruits of identical plants, even those growing side by side, have differences in shape, color, smell, and taste.</p><p>
"Only one thing is inexplicable. How—why—did he and she, after meeting for the first time, invariably fall in love with each other? And why was their love so unusually ardent?</p><p>
"'It's all simple here,' a philosopher would answer today. 'Their feelings had been ignited even before they met by their own dream.'</p><p>
"But a sorcerer with streaks of gray could answer a question like this only with cunning: 'Our river was always a playful one.'</p><p>
"Of course, had he so desired, the sorcerer could have sorted out in detail each moment of the ritual I've recounted and accurately determined the purpose of each moment. And written a great treatise. But no sorcerer would waste his thought on an activity like that. The whole point, Vladimir, is that they . . . Did not sort out life, they CREATED it!"</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Nourishing the Life of the Flesh</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"People of the Vedian period did not know a single physical illness. Even at the age of one hundred fifty or two hundred, they remained of good cheer, bubbling with life, and absolutely healthy. They had no doctors or healers like those who exist today in such numbers. Illnesses of the flesh were impossible because the way of life on people's own homestead—the natural dimension of Love arranged by them—wholly regulated their nourishment process. Man's organism was provided with everything essential in the right quantity and at the most propitious time of day for using the food, and at the most favorable disposition of the planets for taking consuming the food.</p><p>
"Pay attention, Vladimir. It is no accident in nature that everything is arranged so that in the course of just a spring-summer-fall cycle the different plants ripen and bear their fruits in a specific sequence.</p><p>
"First the herbs appear—the dandelion, for example. They, too, are pleasant and can be tasty, especially when combined with winter food.</p><p>
"The early currants, and strawberries, and raspberries ripen—earlier in the sun and later in the shade—the sweet cherries, then the sour cherries and many other fruits, herbs, and berries. Choosing precisely their own time, they try to attract human attention with their unusual shape, color, and fragrance.</p><p>
"There was no science about food then. What one should eat, how much, and at what time—no one even thought about that then. Nonetheless, man used everything he needed for food precisely down to the gram.</p><p>
"Each berry, herb, and fruit has its own day in the year, its own hour and minute, when it can bring the most benefit to man's organism. When, raising itself, it completes the process by linking to the universal planets. Then, it factors in the nature of the ground beneath it, and the plants around it, and man, bestowing its gaze upon them, assesses and determines what it needs most of all. On that very day, when it is ready to serve man, man honors it with his acceptance and allows this perfection to be his food.</p><p>
"I said that the pregnant woman should always reside in her own orchard, in the dimension created with her beloved, all nine months. This is not an occult mystery. In it lies the great rationality of Divine being. Judge for yourself. In nature there are many plants that can discontinue pregnancy in women painlessly—garlic, for example, and oregano, male fern, birthwort, and many others. Other plants can help, in harmony, to develop the fruit in the mother's womb. No one could ever say which ones must be taken and in what quantity. Only he who is in the mother's womb knows this, and he is concerned not only about himself, but about his mother. This is why it often happens that a woman who has given birth to a child becomes prettier, as if younger.</p><p>
"For this to happen, the pregnant woman must definitely be in her own orchard. Every blade of grass in it knows her, and the fruit grows only for her. She has also come to know their taste and smell. Her desires are natural and will determine better than anyone how much of what she needs to take as nourishment.</p><p>
"On someone else's homestead, in someone else's orchard, that kind of precision is impossible. The other person's orchard may even be many times richer and its vegetation more varied. Ideal nourishment is also impossible in someone else's orchard because before using some fruit, berry, or herb for food, the woman must first try it.</p><p>
"She wanted to eat an apple, so she picked it and took a bite. She swallowed the piece and immediately sensed that her organism did not need this. By doing this she had harmed herself and her child. Why did this happen? The whole problem is that even outwardly identical-tasting fruits can be made up of different substances. In her own orchard, tasting its fruits more than once, she could not make that mistake. In someone else's, a mistake is inevitable.</p><p>
"What knowledge, what law helped man of that era to nourish himself so precisely? The absence of laws and treatises! He could rely only on the Divine. Today, people say that man is whole, one with nature, but where does this whole lie now, when man consumes only the artificial food the system finds convenient and offers him? The hours for consuming food have been set by an arbitrary, artificial system.</p><p>
"Then, in the Vedian period, man's God-given senses decided everything for him, and the tiniest dimension could satisfy the sensation of hunger. After all, man's senses, in accord with his dimension of Love, like the most perfect automaton or smartest treatise, determined the minutes when he should take nourishment.</p><p>
"Man walked in the dimension he created. His thought was free and could solve universal problems or create. All around were fruits, alluring in their beauty. Intuitively, he picked one of them, or two or three, and ate them, without letting his thoughts stray to what God had given him for his delectation.</p><p>
"Man did not think about food then. He nourished himself the way we today breathe. The dimension he created, together with his intuition, resolved precisely the problem of how, when, and what to feed his flesh.</p><p>
"In winter, many plants were released from their fruits and leaves and prepared to rest. Winter is for creating the coming spring.</p><p>
"However, even in winter, man did not waste his thought on food, although he did not prepare anything to eat in advance. All this was done for him with great effort and love by his domestic animals. The squirrels prepared many mushrooms and nuts. The bees collected pollen and honey. In the fall, the bear dug a cellar and put roots in it. And in early spring, awakening, the bear went up to the man's dwelling and rumbled, or hit the door lightly with its paw, it didn't matter. The bear was summoning man in order to show him which of the cellars to dig up. Might the bear have forgotten where he hid the food? Might he have missed contact? Any member of the family might come out to him, but most often it was a child. Giving the awakened worker a pat on the snout, he would go to the marked spot and stamp his little foot. In that spot, the bear worked hard to claw up the earth and tear out the stores. When it saw them it rejoiced, jumped up, and showed its paw above the surface but did not eat them first, waiting for the person to take at least something to his own dwelling.</p><p>
"The person may have put up some food himself, too, but this was more art than work. Many families made wine from various berries and fruits. The wine was not strong or alcoholic, like vodka, but a most salubrious beverage. Of animal food, man might also use milk, but not from every animal. He took it only from an animal he considered to be good-natured, kind, and intelligent and that expressed a need for man to enjoy its output. For example, if one of the children or one of the older family members went up to a goat or cow and touched its udder but the animal suddenly shied away. Man would not drink the milk of an animal that did not want to share it with him. This does not mean that he took a dislike to man. It often happened that animals, in some way unknown to them, determined that at a given moment the composition of the milk mixture was not beneficial to this person.</p><p>
"People of the Vedian civilization only fed on the diverse plant foods from their own plot and what their domestic animals brought them. This approach was not stipulated by any superstition or law. It was the result of great knowledge.</p><p>
"There is more than one way to 'know,' and there are different degrees of 'knowing.' One can not only know but also sense with one's self, one's flesh and soul, many phenomena, the purposes of the Divine creations, and His system.</p><p>
"Each Vedian knew in this way that what he used for food not only nourished the flesh, but also filled the soul with consciousness and brought him personally information from all the Universe's worlds.</p><p>
"This is why the energy inside them, and the sharpness of mind, and the speed of thought in those people exceeded that of modern people many times over.</p><p>
"The animal world and the plants living in the human family's dimension reacted to man as to a god. The animals, herbs, and trees all thirsted for a kind glance or a good-natured touch from man.</p><p>
"This power of sensory energy did not allow weeds to grow in the garden or orchard. Many people today also know that a domestic flower can suddenly wither if it is not to the liking of someone in the family. On the other hand, it can flourish if it feels love and communication.</p><p>
"This is why Vedian people never touched their garden with a hoe. There is an expression even today: 'evil eye' or 'put the evil eye on.' It comes from those times. Those people were able to create a great deal with the energy of their senses.</p><p>
"Imagine a person walking across the ground of his plot. Everything around tries to catch his good glance. Here he looked at a weed. 'Why are you here?' the man thought. The weed soon would wither from sorrow. On the contrary, if someone smiled at a cherry tree, that would make its sap run through its veins with doubled energy. If a person had to go on a long journey, he did not encumber himself with something to eat. He could find plenty of food for himself on his way. When he stopped in at a settlement and gazed upon its beautiful homesteads, he could ask for something to eat or drink. It was considered an honor to offer a traveler beverages, fruits, and delicious roots."</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Life Without Robbery or Theft</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"Among the people of the Vedian civilization, throughout the millennia of its existence, there was not a single robbery, theft, or simple fistfight. Insulting words were even absent from their lexicon. At the same time, there were no laws punishing such actions.</p><p>
"Laws can never ward off evil deeds, but the Veds' knowledge and culture did not allow for conflicts between people.</p><p>
"Judge for yourself, Vladimir. After all, each family living on its own homestead knew that if any unpleasantness arose with anyone, even an outsider, on the homestead itself or nearby, even at the edge of the settlement, the entire dimension would suffer.</p><p>
"The universal energy of aggression would affect what grew and everything that lived in it. The balance of energies would change. The energy of aggression can grow, reflect back on adults and children, and strike posterity with illness.</p><p>
"On the contrary, if a passing traveler left a joyous feeling, the dimension would radiate even more beauty.</p><p>
"In addition, the person who came to the settlement would be physically incapable of eating a fruit he had picked or picked up in a garden that belonged to someone else.</p><p>
"The Vedian people had a high sensitivity. Their organism could immediately sense a significant difference when it tasted a fruit picked without leave and a fruit offered by a kind hand. It is today, in modern stores, that food often does not have the smell and taste of the primordial product. It is soulless and indifferent to man. It is no one's and is given to no one. It is venal.</p><p>
"If modern man could try and compare the food there was in the Vedian period, he would not be able to eat modern products.</p><p>
"A stranger could not even contemplate taking something that was someone else's without asking. Any object, even a stone, contains information, and only the family living on the homestead knew what kind.</p><p>
"Each homestead of the Vedian civilization was an impregnable fortress against anything malicious. At the same time it was a maternal womb for the family living on it.</p><p>
"No one built high fortress walls; the homestead territory was marked off by a living green fence. Both this fence and everything growing behind it safeguarded the family against all phenomena negative to the human flesh and soul.</p><p>
"I have already told you about how relatives buried the bodies of the deceased only in their own garden or the homestead's woods.</p><p>
"Those people knew that the human soul is eternal, but even material bodies cannot vanish without a trace. Each object, even an outwardly soulless one, bears quite a lot of universal information.</p><p>
"Nothing disappears into nothingness in Divine nature. It merely changes its state and flesh.</p><p>
"The bodies of the deceased were not covered with stone slabs, and even the place of their burial was not marked in any way. The dimension created by their hand and heart served as a great monument to them.</p><p>
"While changing their state, the now soulless bodies nurtured trees, grasses, and flowers. The children born walked among them. Oh, how everything around loved the children! The spirit of their ancestors hovered above the dimension, loving and safeguarding the children.</p><p>
"Children treated the dimension of their homeland with love. Their thought did not create the illusion of life's finiteness. The Ved's life is infinite.</p><p>
"The soul soared through all the universal dimensions and, after visiting various planes of being, was reincarnated in human guise.</p><p>
"Waking up, a child would smile once again in the garden in his homeland. The entire dimension would respond to him with a smile. The sunbeam, the breeze rustling the leaves, the flower, and the distant star would exhale ecstatically: 'We are united, embodied by you, child of Divine being.'</p><p>
"Today, the requests of elderly people living in foreign lands are considered inexplicable: 'When I die, bury me in my homeland.'</p><p>
"Intuitively, these people sense that only their homeland is capable of returning them to the earth in a heavenly garden. A foreign land rejects their souls.</p><p>
"People strive to bury their bodies in their homeland. For millennia, their souls have asked for this. But how can one call a cemetery one's homeland, no matter what country it is in?</p><p>
"Cemeteries arose quite recently for the purpose of tormenting human souls with hell, demeaning them, enslaving them, and forcing them to worship.</p><p>
"Cemeteries resemble . . . they are like vacant lots where people dump their unwanted junk. The souls of the dead suffer above the cemetery. The living fear cemeteries.</p><p>
"Imagine a homestead of those times. The bodies of many generations are buried there. Each living blade of grass tries to caress and be useful for man's flesh.</p><p>
"For anyone who comes with aggression, each blade of grass and each fruit in the garden suddenly become poisonous. This is why it never even occurred to anyone to take anything without leave.</p><p>
"A homestead could not be seized by force. It could not be bought for any money. Who is going to encroach upon something that is capable of destroying the encroacher?</p><p>
"Each was trying himself to create his own beautiful oasis. The planet grew prettier with each passing year.</p><p>
"When man casts his gaze over the modern city from high above today, what does he see? Piles of artificial stones cover the earth. Buildings rise up and out. The stone landscape covers greater and greater expanses—now here, now there. It contains no clean water, and the air is polluted. How many happy families live amid these stone hulks?</p><p>
"Comparing modern families with a family of the Vedian culture, then not a single one. One can say even more: human families are not living amid the stone artificial hulks; they are sleeping.</p><p>
"In their hypnotic sleep, one single living cell nonetheless roams through the body like a seed. It falls still, then races, touching thousands and thousands of others, the living cell keeps trying to awaken the sleeping ones, and it is called the Waking Dream. It will awaken them! Then human families will begin creating beautiful oases on Earth.</p><p>
"As before, so shall it be again. If one were to look at the Earth from high above, one's gaze would be enchanted by many vibrant scenes, and each beautiful scene would mean that in this place the hand of an awakened Ved had touched the earth. Once again a happily family of people would live in their homeland, people who knew God and the meaning and purpose of life.</p><p>
"The Veds knew why there were stars in the sky. Among them were many great poets and artists. No hostility existed between settlements. There was no reason for theft or plunder. Bureaucracies were unknown structures. Ved-Russian culture flourished where the modern countries of Europe, India, Egypt, and China are today, and there were no boundaries between the different territories. There were no rulers great or small. The sequence of great holidays was the natural government.</p><p>
"People of the Vedian period possessed knowledge of the world order in immeasurably more detail than modern man does. Their internal energy allowed them to speed up the growth of some plants and slow down others. Domestic animals strove to carry out man's commands not in order to get food, of which there was an abundance. Rather, they wanted to be rewarded by man's beneficial energy.</p><p>
"Even now, man's praise is pleasant to everyone: to man, to animal, and to plant.</p><p>
"Previously, however, people's energy was immeasurably greater, and everything strove toward it as if toward the Sun."</p><p>

</br></div>
</p><p>
"Toward the end of the Vedian period, a great discovery was made, unequalled in the entire history of human civilizations on Earth.</p><p>
"People learned the manifest power of collective thought.</p><p>
"Here we must define human thought. Man's thought is an energy without equal in the any dimension. It can create beautiful worlds or weapons, it can destroy a planet, and it has created all matter without exception, what we see today.</p><p>
"Nature, the animal world, man himself—all were created in a great inspiration by Divine thought.</p><p>
"The many artificial objects, machines, and mechanisms we can see today were created by man's thought. You might think that it is the hands of man that produce them. Yes, today hands have to be used. Nonetheless, in the beginning, thought creates every detail.</p><p>
"Today, man's thought is considered more perfect than in the past. But that is far from true.</p><p>
"In each person of the Vedian civilization, it was a million times faster and fuller of information than the thought of modern man. As proof of this, we can take from the past the knowledge of the use of plants for healing and food. Nature has a mechanism far more perfect and complex than artificial things.</p><p>
"Man did not only call many beasts to serve him. He did not only determine the purpose of all the plants. When he understood the power of collective thought, he saw that with its help he could control the weather. He could make a spring flow from the depths. If one mishandles thought, one can strike down a bird in flight and influence the life of a distant star—plant gardens on stars or destroy stars. This is not a fiction, but a reality, and this was all given to humanity.</p><p>
"Today each person knows how, having started down the technocratic path, man tried to create a rocket that could fly to the stars.</p><p>
"They flew to the Moon and back, spending quite a bit of money and energy, to the Earth's detriment. But they changed nothing on the Moon. A method like that is doomed; it is unpromising and dangerous for all the people of Earth and for other planets. There is another method, much more perfect. By thought alone, one can cultivate a flower on the Moon, create an atmosphere compatible for man, plant a garden, and be in that garden with one's beloved in the flesh. But before this, thought must transform the entire Earth into a blooming, heavenly garden. And this needs to be done by collective thought.</p><p>
"Collective thought is powerful. In all the Universe there is no energy capable of inhibiting its actions. Present-day matter and technology are a reflection of collective thought, which invented all mechanisms and modern weapons.</p><p>
"But remember, I said that in Vedian times, the thought of each living person was immeasurably greater in power and energy. Nine people gathered together could move objects, stones weighing many tons. In order to use collective thought more easily to benefit the majority while simultaneously not wasting time to assemble many people in one place, people thought up the images of different gods. With their help, they began controlling nature.</p><p>
"The god of the Sun appeared in his image of Fire, Rain, Love, and Fertility. People created everything essential to them for life through images in which human thought was concentrated. It accomplished many useful things. For example, rain was essential for watering, so one person aimed his thought at the image of the god of Rain. If rain was indeed essential, then many people would direct their energy at the image of rain. When the image had enough energy, clouds would gather and rain would fall, watering the crops.</p><p>
"Unlimited opportunity was given humanity by Divine nature. When humanity was able to overcome the temptations of unlimited power, to keep all the universal energies in balance in itself, then gardens, the fruit of human thought, could arise in other galaxies, and man could make other worlds happy. The period, known as Imagery, flourished. Man created in it and felt himself a god in it. Who else could the son of God be?</p><p>
"In the Imagery period, man akin to God begins to create images. This period lasts nine thousand years. God does not intervene in man's actions. The various energies of the Universe become excited, tempting man.</p><p>
"There are particles of all the universal energies in man. There are many of them, and they are contradictory. But all the particles of universal energies must be balanced in man, combined into a single harmonious whole.</p><p>
"When even one comes to predominate, the others are immediately reduced, the harmony is violated, and then the Earth is transformed and becomes disharmonious.</p><p>
"The image can lead people to the beautiful, but it can also lead to destruction when the unity is violated internally.</p><p>
"But what is an image?</p><p>
"An image is an energy essence made by human thought. It can be created one person or several.</p><p>
"A vivid example of collective co-creation of an image is the actor's acting. One person describes the image on paper, and another depicts the described image on stage.</p><p>
"What happens to the actor depicting an invented image? For a time, the actor replaces his own feelings, aspirations, and desires for those inherent in the invented image. In doing so, the actor may change his walk, his facial expression, his usual clothing. Thus, the invented image takes on flesh for a time.</p><p>
"Only man has been granted the ability to create images.</p><p>
"The image created by man can live in a dimension only as long as a person presents it through his thought. One person or several at once.</p><p>
"The larger the number of people nourishing an image with their emotions, the stronger it becomes.</p><p>
"An image created by collective human thought can possess tremendous destructive or constructive power. It has a feedback connection with people and shapes the character and the manner of conduct of large and small groups of people.</p><p>
"Using the discovery of their great possibilities, people enthusiastically created the planet's life.</p><p>
"As it happened, however, at the beginning of the Imagery period, only six people were unable to keep in balance within themselves the universal energies God had given man at creation. They may even have appeared so that humanity could experience everything.</p><p>
"At first, only in one of the six did the energy of greatness and selfhood take the upper hand, then in another, and a third, and a sixth.</p><p>
"At first they did not meet together. Each lived by himself, but like was drawn to like. Now they directed their thought to how to become rulers of all the people of the Earth. Publically, they called themselves priests.</p><p>
"Reincarnating from age to age, they live on to this day.</p><p>
"The peoples of all the Earth today are governed by just six people; these are the priests. Their dynasties are tens of thousands of years old. From generation to generation, they have handed down to their heirs occult knowledge and the science of imagery, which is partially known to them as well. They painstakingly conceal Vedian knowledge from everyone else.</p><p>
"Among the six there is one principal one, and he is called the head or the high priest; today he considers himself the head ruler of the human community.</p><p>
"The high priest began to suspect from just the few sentences I uttered and that you cited in the books as well as from the public reaction, who I in fact was. Just in case, with his insignificant powers, he attempted to destroy me. He did not succeed. He was surprised, and he tried to use even more of his powers, since he still did not believe completely who I was.</p><p>
"Now I have uttered the word 'Ved-Russian,' thereby revealing myself fully. The current high priest on Earth today fears even that word. Imagine how he has been shaken now, knowing what stands behind him. Now he will send his soldiers, all his biorobots, and the forces of all the occult dark sciences to destroy me, and he himself will be forming his plan of destruction every minute. Let him do so; on the other hand, he will be too busy to bother with others.</p><p>
"Here you were speaking about malicious articles in the modern press, Vladimir. Now you will see them intensify and become more extensive. You will see provocations and slander. The entire arsenal of devices that have been used for millennia by the forces of darkness to destroy the culture of our people. But what you see in the beginning is only the tip of the iceberg. Not all people can contemplate occult attacks. But you will understand them, too, feel and see them. Do not be afraid of them, I beg of you. What is frightening is powerless in front of the fearless. You must forget what you've seen immediately. No matter how omnipotent the forgotten monster is, it will cease to exist altogether.</p><p>
"It is an unusual fact, and I can see the doubts in you. Don't be in any hurry to yield to your doubts. Think calmly for yourself.</p><p>
"After all, even a small group of people who have gathered together and decided to build something always has a leader among them, so let's call him the ruler.</p><p>
"A small enterprise has an official director. A large enterprise has several rulers and one who is chief over them. There are many rulers over all kinds of areas, which have various names: territory, province, state, community, republic. It doesn't matter. Each state has a ruler, and he has many aides. The ruler of the state—is that all? That is what people often believe. You think that no one controls the entire human community and that there are no takers to ascend to the earthly throne?</p><p>
"There were and are takers. You know from recent history many names of commanders who attempted to seize power over the world by force. But none of them was ever able to seize power over the world. When they merely approached universal power, something inevitably happened. As a result, the army and the pretender to world sovereignty were destroyed.</p><p>
"Further, a state considered powerful and flourishing that encroached upon power over the whole world suddenly became mediocre.</p><p>
"In the last ten thousand years, this is what always happened. But why? It is all because the world has long had a secret ruler. He plays with states, their rulers, and individual people.</p><p>
"He calls himself the high priest of the entire Earth, and his five assistants are called priests.</p><p>
"Pay attention to one other fact, Vladimir. Think for yourself, wars among people have gone on unceasingly for millennia in different parts of the globe. In each country, the looting, plagues, and different disasters have intensified from day to day, but a strict—the strictest—prohibition has been placed on one question: Is human civilization in fact following the path of progress or has it been degrading with each passing day?</p><p>
</p><p>"The answer to this question will be simple. First, look at how the priests attained their power and how they have been able to hold onto it until now.</p><p>
"Their first achievement leading to their secret goal was the creation of the Egyptian state. Present-day historians know the Egyptian state more than others. However, if you take the facts and commentaries from the history and clear out the mysticism, then you can come in contact with many secrets.</p><p>
"First fact. In history, the supreme ruler was called the pharaoh. Many of the pharaohs' military accomplishments and defeats have been described. Their magnificent tombs strike the imagination to this day and draw scholars to try to guess their secrets. Meanwhile, the pyramids' grandeur leads us away from the main secret.</p><p>
"The pharaoh was considered not only the ruler of all people but also a kind of god. The people came to him with their requests for a bountiful year, for rainfall, and to divert ill winds. History can know about many of the pharaohs' actual deeds, but after learning all the facts about the pharaohs, ask yourself whether any of the pharaohs really was the ruler of a great state and a god over people? Having considered the facts, you will see that the pharaoh was nothing but a biorobot in the priests' hands.</p><p>
"Here are the facts we have, known to historians as well.</p><p>
"During the time of the pharaohs, there were magnificent temples and priests, and there was one high priest. Several candidates for pharaoh were always studying under their watchful eye. Everything they wanted, the priests suggested to the young boys. Among other things, they suggested to them that the pharaoh was chosen by God. At the same time, they talked about how the high priest himself heard God speak in the secret temple. Then the priests would decide which of the candidates should be pharaoh.</p><p>
"So they would set the day. The new pharaoh would take his seat on a magnificent throne, holding symbols and arrayed in special garments. To the people he was an omnipotent king, a god. Only the priests knew that their biorobot was on the throne and exactly, having studied his character since childhood, how he would govern and what gifts he would offer up to please the priesthood.</p><p>
"Some few pharaohs tried to get out from under the high priest's power, all without success. After all, the priest's power is invisible, whereas the pharaoh's royal raiment is visible to all. The priest's power does not require a verbal command or a manifest communication. The priest's power over each ruler does not let up for a moment, and that power settles in the majority of his subjects as a false suggestion about the world order. If the pharaoh himself had ever been able to think calmly, freed of the images suggested to him, he might have become a human being, but it had all been planned from the beginning that the pharaoh would not be able to free himself from the daily cares and commotion.</p><p>
"The commotion! News from the far corners of the vast state are brought to him by his couriers, scribes, deputies. Swift decisions have to be made. Then there is also war, which takes up all one's thoughts. The pharaoh speeds in his chariot, he censures or rewards his subjects, and often he himself does not get enough sleep. Meanwhile, the priest contemplates calmly, and therein lies his advantage.</p><p>
"The priest constructs plans to hold the whole world under his one power. Even more, he thinks about how to create his own world, separate from the world created by God.</p><p>
"What does he care about the silly pharaoh boy and his crowds of subjects? For the priest, they are all playthings.</p><p>
"The priests secretly studied the science of imagery. The human masses forgot the law of nature more and more.</p><p>
"It was the priests, Vladimir, who transferred the energy of interaction between people and the living Divinity, the creation of nature, to the temples they created, who fed off that energy, the energy of people, not repaying it.</p><p>
"For each, what was obvious under Vedian culture suddenly became secret. The people started going to sleep, as if hypnotized, and seemed to follow decrees without thinking, half-asleep. The people destroyed nature's Divine world. They built an artificial one to please the priests. The priests maintained their science in strict secrecy. They didn't even dare write all of it down on scrolls. They invented their own language for interacting with each other, and you can learn this fact from history, too. Another language became essential for them so that in communicating with each other, no one came into contact with their secrets. Thus, to this day, these simple secrets have been handed down to priestly generations.</p><p>
"Six thousand years ago, the high priest, one of those six priests, decided to take power over the whole world.</p><p>
"He reasoned, 'I cannot seize power by military means or with the pharaohs' armies, even if I teach commanders to use deadlier weapons than others have. What can an army of stupid, thoughtless men do? Plunder gold, but there is already a lot of that. There are more than enough slaves, but they emanate a nonbeneficent energy, it is bad to take food from the hands of a slave. It does not taste good and is harmful. Human souls must be subjugated and all the energy of their tender love aimed at oneself. But here we need scientific thought, not an army. The science of imagery—this is my invisible army. The deeper I come to know it, the more loyal the army will be to me. The less the crowd knows it, plunged as it is into the occult and unreality, the more I will have conquered it.'</p><p>
"The high priest came up with his own plan. To this day it finds its reflection in the events of six thousand years of history.</p><p>
"You and everyone knows about recent events. They differ only in their interpretations. But you just try to find your own and then you will discover the truth. Look.</p><p>
"Here, at the council of those six priests, a plan is set forth that will henceforth be known to many; the Bible—the Old Testament—tells us this. The priest Moses, at the behest of the high priest, leads the Hebrew people out of Egypt. The people are promised the most beautiful life in the Promised Land, which has been prepared for the Hebrew people by God.</p><p>
"Before God, they declare the Jews to be the chosen people. The tempting news excites minds, and some of the people follow Moses. For forty years, he leads the people from place to place in the desert. The priest's assistants read the prophesies constantly, they talk about chosenness, and force them to do battle and loot cities, and all in His name, in God's name.</p><p>
"When someone, recovering from this psychosis, demands a return to his former life, to correct him he is declared a sinner, and he is given a deadline to reform. If he does not, they kill him. The priests do not hide behind their own name but call these acts of God.</p><p>
"I am not telling you a fiction or a dream. Each person can himself be convinced of this by the Bible, the Old Testament. In that great historic book, each person can see the events of history in their authenticity if he only wakes slightly from the hypnotic dream of millennia and reads how the Hebrew people were programmed and transformed into the priest's host. Later, Jesus attempted to deprogram his own people, and having shown his capacity for knowledge, he attempted to turn back the priests' intention. Traveling among wise men, he tried to learn the science of imagery grain by grain. Once he had learned a lot, he decided to save his Hebrew people. He was able to create his own religion so that it could stand up to what was this terrible thing.</p><p>
"His religion was not for the peoples of all the Earth. It was intended only for the Hebrew people. He himself spoke of this more than once. His words were written down by his disciples, and you can read them today. Here, for example, the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 15, verses 22-28: 'And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But He answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away, for she crieth after us. But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.'</p><p>
"What do these words mean: 'I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel'? Why is Jesus' teaching only for the Jews? Why does He consider the Hebrew people lost?</p><p>
"I assure you, Vladimir, Jesus understood that during the forty-year programming in the Sinai desert, the majority of the Hebrew people plunged into a hypnotic dream. This portion and Moses himself were a weapon in the hands of the high priest. They were his soldiers, whom he obliged for the pleasure of his own ambition to seize dominion over the people of all the Earth.</p><p>
"They will be fighting for millennia in different corners of the Earth. Rather than the primitive sword or bullet, their weapon will be cunning and a way of life in which all peoples submit to occultism—which means, priestly self-regard.</p><p>
"They will fight without sparing themselves.</p><p>
"'But any defeat presumes the presence of opposing sides,' you thought. 'And if that is so, where are the victims? In defeats, there must be victims on both sides.'</p><p>
"You could have found this proof yourself from the dates of events mentioned in various historical sources.</p><p>
"To ease the search for those terrible dates, I will cite for you now just a few of them. If you wish, you can seek out historical confirmation yourself.</p><p>
"Today everyone, including you, Vladimir, knows how terror kills children and old people in Israel from terror. Very recently you heard, there was a war, which was called World War II. Documents have even been preserved on how purposely during the years of that war Jews—old people and children, mothers and pregnant young women bearing fruit, and young men who had not yet known love—were burned in ovens, poisoned with gas, and buried alive in mass graves.</p><p>
Not one, not a hundred, not a thousand people perished, rather millions of them were viciously murdered in a short period of time. Historians blame Hitler for this, but the culprit lived in another time, considerably earlier. In 1113, in Kievan Rus', popular indignation against the Jews suddenly flared up. Jewish homes both in Kiev and in other places in ancient Rus' were looted and burned, and Jews, even children, were murdered without mercy. The people of ancient Rus', gripped by a bestial hatred, were prepared to remove their ruling princes as well. Gathering in a council, the princes decided to promulgate a law: "Now, from all the Russian land, expel all the Jews and not let them in henceforth. Rob and kill those who enter secretly."</p><p>
In 1290, the English suddenly began killing their Jews. Rulers were forced to expel the Jewish people from the country.</p><p>
In 1492, Jewish pogroms began in Spain. The threat of physical annihilation hung over all the Jews living in Spain, and they were forced to quit the country.</p><p>
From the moment the Jews left the Sinai desert, the peoples of many countries began to hate them, a hate manifested first here, then there, in cruel pogroms and killings.</p><p>
I have cited the dates of the terrible pogroms merely so that you yourself can learn from the history people have written. The Jewish people have had many conflicts, besides these dates. Each of them individually is less significant, of course, than all the ones we know, but if the many small conflicts are combined into one, it becomes the most terrible of the terrible, unprecedented in scale.</p><p>
If this goes on for more than a millennium, then one can conclude that the Jewish nation is guilty before people. But what are they guilty of? Historians, both ancient and present-day, proclaim that they have brought plots against the state. They try to deceive everyone, great and small. They aim to take away the little the poor man has through trickery and to ruin the rich man altogether, and this is confirmed by the fact that among the Jews there are many rich people capable of influencing even governments.</p><p>
But there is one question, you must ask yourself. How righteous is he himself who has been deceived by the Jews? He who accumulated wealth, did he obtain it all by honest means? And he who is doomed by power, is he intelligent enough if he can be so easily deceived?</p><p>
In addition, the majority of rulers are dependent, and it is the Jews who have clearly shown this. One could discuss this topic for a long time, but the answer is simple: in the occult world, everyone lives by deceit. So is there any point in discussing who achieved more among everything else?</p><p>
As for the Jewish people, any of today's peoples could be in their place. Any, had they been subjected to the most unprecedented programming: over forty years of wandering through the desert, listening only to the occult, not seeing what God created.</p><p>
Jesus tried to deprogram and save his people. He came up with a new religion for them, different from the previous one. For example, instead of "An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth," he said, "Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also." Instead of "You are a chosen people," he said, "You are God's slave."</p><p>
Jesus could have told his people the truth. Told them about Vedian times, about how man could live happily on his own homestead, in contact with the creations of the Creator Father, but the Jewish people had already been programmed. They believed only in occult acts, and the unreal world pressed on their consciousness. Jesus decided to act by occult means as well. He created an occult religion.</p><p>
The high priest was able to guess Jesus' intention. The high priest thought hard for more than a year until he found a solution. Quite brilliantly, he decided the following: "There is no point struggling against Jesus' teaching. Using his intellect, he had to embed his Jewish soldiers among the peoples of all the Earth, while leaving Israel its old religion." Thus it happened as the high priest intended.</p><p>
Two essentially different philosophies began to exist in the same time.</p><p>
One proclaims that the Jews are the chosen people, as Moses taught, and everyone must be subject to them. The other says, in the words of Jesus, that all are equal before God, and people should not rise up over others and must love their neighbor, even their enemy.</p><p>
The priest realized that if he could seize the whole world with the Christian religion, which calls everyone to love and obedience, while at the same time preserving Judaism, that he would raise one over all and the world would be subdued. The world would bow to the Jews, but they were merely soldiers. The world would be bowing to the priest.</p><p>
And the priest's prophets went into the world, sincerely trying to bear the new teaching.</p><p>
Jesus' teaching? Not quite. The doctrine now included quite a lot introduced by the priest. What happened then, you know. Rome fell. The great empire was not destroyed by outside enemies. Rome collapsed from within, after recognizing Christianity. However, the emperors believed that their Christianity strengthened their power. They were very flattered by the idea that any power comes from God, and the ruler, the emperor, is anointed to his kingdom by God's grace.</p><p>
In the fourth century, Christianity officially and in fact emerged victorious in Rome. Smiling, the high priest issued an unspoken command to the Byzantine emperor without actually contacting him. And Christian Rome burns the library of Alexandria* to the ground. They burned seven hundred thousand and thirty-three volumes. Bonfires of books and ancient scrolls burned in various cities. They burned books from the pagan period, but among these books were also a few with the knowledge of Vedian people. They did not burn those but removed them, hid them, and studied them in a narrow circle among the initiated and only later destroyed them.</p><p>
The high priest now felt that since people had moved farther and farther away from the knowledge of the primary sources, there would be no obstacles on his path. Emboldened, he issued one more invisible command, and as a result, at the Second Council of Constantinople an anathema was pronounced against the teaching called reincarnation. Why, you ask? So that people would not give close thought to the essence of earthly life, so that they would think that outside Earth there exists a happy life. So many began to believe.</p><p>
The priest smiled. He knew what would happen next, and he reasoned that man did not see life beyond earth. No one knew how to get into heaven, where it was good, or how to avoid hell, which was frightening. It is here that we give an occult message to suit his plan.</p><p>
Thus, to this day, the priests have spread messages that suited them to the world. But they were unable to gain total power over the world, even when they thought the strongest bastion of pagan culture, Rome, had been destroyed. There still remained on Earth just one little island not under the power of the usual spells. Even before Rome and before the appearance of Jesus' teaching, the high priest strove to destroy the culture of the last Vedian state: Rus'.</p><p>
* The Library of Alexandria was the most famous library of antiquity. It contained all the works that existed at that time. During Caesar's time, they numbered about 700,000 items. During the period of heightened clashes between pagans and Christians, which in 391 destroyed the temple of Sarapis, where the library was held.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0607>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>7. The Secret War Against the Vedian Rus'</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div>
</p><p>"The war against Vedian Rus' was raging long before Jesus appeared on Earth, before the fall of Rome—a thousand-year war waged without the aid of the steel sword. Occultism made its incursions on the nonmaterial plane.</p><p>
"Proponents of the occult religion went to Rus'; you can learn tens of their names from present-day church books, but there were tens of thousands of them. They were innocent in their delusions. They were fanatics, which meant they could not encompass a millionth part of the universe with their thought. They were the priest's soldiers, in carrying out his command without a murmur, reverentially, tried to inspire people about how to live. They strove to say the very same thing as people once had in the magnificent Roman state.</p><p>
"They attempted to introduce ritual and suggested building temples that ignored earthly existence and nature. Then the heavenly kingdom would come for each and every person. I am not going to burden you with their exhortations. Even today, if you like, you can read what was said. I will tell you about the reason, why for thousands of years they were unable to make inroads into Vedian Rus'.</p><p>
"Every other person living in that Rus' was a poet and wit, and there were bards in that Rus', then called bayans. And this is what happened in those times. For decades the priest's soldiers waged propaganda in Rus' about how people should worship God, and in some places, narrow-minded people began to listen and think over what was said. When a bayan saw this, he would laugh and compose a parable and sing it. The parable would spread quickly through Rus', and for the next ten years or so Rus' would have a good laugh over the priest's exhortations. Infuriated, the priest would attack again. But once again a parable would be born in Rus', and once again Rus' would laugh. Of the many parables of those days, I will tell you three.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Which Temple Shall God Be In (Anastasia's First Parable)</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"The people in one of the many settlements on Earth were living happily. There were ninety-nine families in this settlement. Each of the families had a beautiful house decorated with fanciful carving. The garden around the house bore fruit every year. It raised the vegetables and berries itself. People greeted the spring joyfully and took pleasure in the summer. The sequence of cheerful, friendly holidays gave birth to songs and dances. In winter, people rested from the daily rejoicing, and contemplating the heavens, they tried to decide whether the stars and moon could be woven into better patterns than they now had.</p><p>
"Once every three years, in July, these people gathered together in a glade at the edge of their settlement. Once every three years, God answered their questions in an ordinary voice. Invisible to the gaze of ordinary eyes, God was tangible to each and every person. Together with each resident of the settlement, he would decide how best to arrange life for the days to come. The conversation between the people and God was philosophical, but sometimes quite simple and jocular.</p><p>
"For example, a middle-aged man said to God, 'What were you doing, God, at our holiday this summer, when we all gathered at dawn and you started soaking everyone with rain? The rain poured until dinnertime like a heavenly waterfall, and the sun began to shine only at dinnertime. What were you doing before dinnertime, sleeping?'</p><p>
"'Not sleeping,' God replied. 'Since dawn I had been thinking how best to act so that the holiday would come out wonderfully well. I saw how some of you, going to the holiday, were too lazy to wash with pure water. What should I do? They would spoil the holiday with their look. So I decided first to wash everyone and then scatter the clouds and let the sun's rays caress your bodies.'</p><p>
"'Well, all right, if that's how it was,' the man agreed, stealthily brushing a crumb of food from his whiskers and wiping the cherry stain from around his son's mouth.</p><p>
"'Tell me, God,' a man, an elderly, thoughtful philosopher, asked God. 'There are many stars above us in the sky. What does their fanciful pattern mean? Can I, if I choose a star that pleases my soul, when I grow weary of earthly life, settle there with my family?'</p><p>
"'The drawing of the heavenly bodies flickering in the dark tell us about the life of the entire Universe. A relaxed and collected soul will allow you to read the book of the sky. The book of the sky does not open up to idleness or mere curiosity but only to pure and significant intentions. And you can settle on a star. Each can choose a heavenly planet for himself. You must observe just one condition. You must become capable of creating better creations on the star you choose than on Earth.'</p><p>
A quite young girl jumped up from the grass, tossed her dark blond braid over her shoulder, raised her little face with its little snub nose, set her hands impudently on her hips, and suddenly told God, 'I have a complaint for you, God. For two years I waited impatiently to express my complaint. Now I will. There is something wrong, something abnormal happening on Earth. All the people live like people, fall in love, get married, and make merry. So what am I guilty of? As soon as spring comes, freckles come out on my cheeks. There's nothing to wash them away with or color them. Did you think them up for your amusement, God? I'm demanding that in the new spring I not have a single freckle again.'</p><p>
"'Oh, my daughter! There will be no freckles, no flecks on your beautiful little face in the spring. But I will call them what you want me to. If you consider freckles such an inconvenience for yourself, I will take them away next spring,' God replied to the little girl.</p><p>
But right then, at the other end of the glade, a well-built youth stood up, and with downcast eyes said quietly, addressing God, 'We will have many things to accomplish in the spring. God, you will try to take part in each matter. Why should you waste your attention on freckles. Especially since they are so beautiful, I cannot imagine an image more beautiful than a young freckled girl.'</p><p>
"'So what should I do?' God said thoughtfully. 'The maiden asked, and I promised her.'</p><p>
"'What do you mean, "What should I do?"' the maiden intervened once again in the conversation. 'The people say, "you should busy yourself with more important matters than freckles." But if we are talking about flecks, then I say you can add two, like this, for symmetry, here on my right cheek.'</p><p>
"God smiled. This could be seen from the fact that the people smiled. Everyone knew that soon a new and beautiful family would be born in their settlement.</p><p>
"Thus the people lived with God in their amazing settlement. One day one hundred wise men came to see them. The joyful residents always greeted visitors with all kinds of food. The wise men tasted wonderful fruits and admired their unusual taste.</p><p>
"Then one of them said, 'Oh, people, your life knows its measure and is beautiful. There is plenty and comfort in each house, but no culture in your communication with God. There is no glorification or worship of the Divinity.'</p><p>
"'But why?' the alarmed residents attempted to object. 'We communicate with God as we do to each other. We communicate once every three years. But every day He rises as the Sun. In the garden, He bustles around each house from spring on as the bee. In winter, He covers the earth as snow. His affairs are clear to us, and we are glad each time.'</p><p>
"'The way you have set this up is wrong,' the wise men said. 'We have come to teach you how to communicate with God. All over the world, palaces and temples have been built for him. In them, people can communicate with God every day, and we are going to teach you.'</p><p>
"For three years, the residents of the settlement listened to the wise men. Each of the hundred defended his own theory as to how best to build a temple for God and what to do in the temple each day. Each of the wise men had his own theory. The residents of the settlement did not know which of the hundred wise teachings to choose. In addition, how were they to do this and not insult the wise men? So they decided, listening to them all, to build all the temples. One per family. But there were ninety-nine families in that village, and there were one hundred wise men. Hearing the decision of all the residents, the wise men became upset. This meant someone would not get a temple and someone would not receive offerings. They began to argue among themselves as to which of the theories for worshiping God was the most effective and to draw the settlement's residents into their debate. The debate heated up, and for the first time in many years the residents of the village forgot about their time for communicating with God. They did not gather in the glade as before on their appointed day.</p><p>
"Another three years passed. Around the settlement stood ninety-nine magnificent temples, and only the huts no longer shone like new. Some of the vegetables went unharvested, and worms began eating the fruits in the orchard.</p><p>
"'All this is because you do not have a complete faith,' the wise men proclaimed in the different temples. 'Bring more gifts to the temple, and worship God more diligently and more often.'</p><p>
"Only one wise man, the one left without a temple, on the sly told one and then another, 'You have done everything wrong, people. All the temples you have built are of the wrong construction, and you are worshiping in the temples incorrectly, uttering the wrong words in your prayers. I alone can teach you how you can communicate with God every day.'</p><p>
"As soon as he was able to convince someone, a new temple rose up, while one of the existing ones immediately fell into decay. Once again, the one wise man who was left without offerings secretly tried to defame the others before the people. Quite a few years passed. One day, the people remembered their former gatherings on the glade where they heard God's voice. Once again they gathered in the glade and began asking questions in the hope that God would hear them and answer as before.</p><p>
"'Answer us. Why has it happened that our orchards yield wormy fruits? Why don't vegetables grow in our gardens every year? Why do people quarrel among themselves, fight, and argue, but cannot choose the best faith for all? Tell us, in which of the temples built for you do you live?'</p><p>
"God did not answer their questions for a long time. When His voice was heard in the dimension, it was weary, not cheerful. God replied to those gathered, 'My sons and my daughters. In your houses, surrounded by gardens, there is today desolation because there was too much for me to do alone. Everything was conceived of initially by the dream that only together with you could I create what was beautiful, but you turned away in part from your own garden and house. I cannot create alone, the creation must be joint. I also want to tell you all that love and the freedom of choice are in you yourselves, and I am prepared to follow your wishes with the dream. But you must answer me, my dear sons and daughters, which of the temples should I take up residence in? You are all equal before me, so where should I be so as not to hurt anyone? When you decide the question of which of the temples I should reside in, I will follow your collective will.'</p><p>
"Thus God answered them all and then fell silent. The people of the settlement, which was once beautiful, have continued their debate to this day. There is desolation and decay in their houses. Around them, the temples rise higher and higher, and the debate grows ever sharper."</p><p>
"Well, Anastasia, you've told me quite an unreal, fairy-tale parable. What very foolish people in that settlement! Didn't they realize that God wants to tend the garden with each of them? Not only that, you say that these foolish people in the settlement are still debating to this day. So where is this settlement located, in what country? Can you tell me?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"Then tell me."</p><p>
"Vladimir, you and the people of different countries are living in that settlement right now."</p><p>
"We are? Of course, exactly, it's us! Of course, it's us. As before, we debate whose faith is better, while our orchards put forth wormy fruit!"</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Best Place in Heaven (Second Parable)</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"Four brothers came to a grave in order to honor the memory of their father, who had died many years before. The brothers wanted to find out whether their father abided in heaven or hell. They all came to the simultaneous desire that their father's soul appear before them and tell them how he was doing in the other world. Their father's image appeared before the brothers in a wondrous glow. The brothers were amazed and delighted, and when they came to their senses, they asked, 'Tell us, Father, does your soul abide in heaven?'</p><p>
"'Yes, my sons,' their father answered them, 'my Soul delights in heaven.'</p><p>
"'Tell us, Father,' the brothers asked, 'where will our souls end up after the death of our flesh?'</p><p>
"The father asked each of the brothers this question: 'Tell me, my sons, how do you yourselves evaluate your earthly actions?'</p><p>
"The brothers answered their father in turn.</p><p>
The oldest son said, 'I became a great commander, father. I defended our native land from enemies, and no hostile foot entered it. I never oppressed the poor and weak. I tried to protect my soldiers, and I always honored God because I hope to get to heaven.'</p><p>
"The second son answered his father: 'I became a famous prophet. I preached to people about good and taught them to honor God. I reached great heights among those like me and high rank because I hope to get to heaven.'</p><p>
"The third son answered his father: 'I became a famous scholar. I have invented many devices to make human life easier. I have built many good structures for people. Always before setting to my task, I praise God and remember and honor His name, and so I hope to get to heaven.'</p><p>
"The youngest brother answered his father: 'Father, I am raising my orchard and laboring in my garden. I send vegetables and fruits from my beautiful garden to my brothers and try not to do anything bad, anything unpleasing to God, and so I hope to end up in heaven.'</p><p>
"The father answered his sons: 'Your souls, my sons, after your fleshly death, will abide in heaven.'</p><p>
"The vision of their father vanished. The years passed, the brothers died, and their souls met in the heavenly garden, only their youngest brother's soul was not among them. Then the three brothers summoned their father, and when he appeared before them in his wondrous glow they asked, 'Tell us, Father, why is the soul of your youngest brother not among us in the heavenly garden? A hundred years have passed in earthly calculation since we spoke with you at your grave.'</p><p>
"'Do not worry, my sons, your youngest brother, too, abides in the heavenly garden. He is not by your side right now because your youngest brother at this moment is with God.'</p><p>
"Another hundred years passed, and once again the brothers met in the heavenly garden, but once again their youngest brother was not among them. Again, the brothers summoned their father, and when he appeared they asked, 'Now another hundred years have passed, but our youngest brother has not come to meet us, and no one has seen him in the heavenly garden. Tell us, father, where is our youngest brother?'</p><p>
"The father answered his three sons: 'Your youngest brother is with God, and so he is not among you.'</p><p>
"The brothers asked their father to show them where and how the youngest was with God. 'Look,' their father answered the brothers. The brothers saw the Earth, and a most wondrous garden on it, which their youngest brother had cultivated during his lifetime. In the wondrous earthly garden, their youngest brother, looking younger, was explaining something to his child. His beauty of a wife was busy doing something nearby.</p><p>
"The brothers were amazed and asked their father, 'Our youngest brother is still in his earthly garden, not in the heavenly one as we are. What is he guilty of before God? Why hasn't the flesh of our youngest brother died? More than a century has passed in earthly calculation, so why are we seeing him young? Has God changed the universal order?'</p><p>
"The father answered, 'God has not changed the universal order, created from the beginning in great harmony and inspired love. Your brother's flesh has died more than once. But the best place for the soul is in the heavenly garden created by your own hands and heart. Just as for a loving mother and father, the child they create is always the most beautiful. Following the Divine order, the soul of your youngest brother should end up in the heavenly garden, but since that garden is on Earth, then it is reincarnated immediately in a new body in the earthly garden dear to it.;</p><p>
"'Tell us, Father,' the brothers continued. 'You told us that our youngest brother is with God, but we do not see God near him in his garden.'</p><p>
"The father told his three sons, 'Your youngest brother, my sons, is tending to God's creations, the trees and grass. They are the Creator's materialized thoughts. By touching them with love and awareness, your youngest brother is thereby with God.'</p><p>
"'Tell us, our father, will we ever return to Earth in fleshly guise?' the sons asked their father and heard in answer: "Your souls, my sons, now abide in the heavenly garden, and they can acquire earthly guise only in the event that someone creates a garden on earth for your souls that resembles the heavenly garden.'</p><p>
"The brothers exclaimed, 'Gardens are not created with love for someone else's soul. We ourselves, if we acquire flesh, will raise a heavenly garden on Earth.'</p><p>
"But the father answered his sons: 'That opportunity was already given to you, my sons.'</p><p>
"He quietly began to move away. But once again the three brothers asked the father, 'Our own dear father, show us your place in the heavenly garden. Why are you moving away from us?'</p><p>
"The father stopped and answered his three sons: 'Look! There, next to your youngest brother in his garden, a spreading apple tree is blooming. Under the apple tree is a small cradle, and in it the beautiful little body of an infant has already moved its little hand. The infant's little body is beginning to wake up, and my soul lives in him. After all, I was the one who began raising this beautiful garden.'"</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Richest Groom (Third Parable)</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"I am going to change this parable slightly and tell it in the modern style.</p><p>
"Two neighbors lived in a certain village. Their families were friendly, they worked to their delight on their own land. In the spring, the orchards bloomed on the two plots, and each contained a small woods. A son was born to each in the family. When the sons of the two friendly families grew up, one day the two families issued a firm decision at a holiday table: to put everything in their sons' hands.</p><p>
"'Let our sons now decide what to sow and when, and you and I, my friend, now must not contradict our sons with a look or a hint,' one said.</p><p>
"'I agree,' the other answered. 'Let our sons, if they want, modify the house their own way. They themselves can choose their clothing and decide what livestock and goods they need.'</p><p>
"'Fine,' the other answered. 'Let our sons be independent, and let them choose themselves worthy brides. We will find brides for our sons together, my friend.'</p><p>
"Thus the two neighbors firmly decided. Their wives supported their initiative, and the families began to live under the control of their grown sons. However, from that time on, the lives of the two families began to differ.</p><p>
"In one, the son was energetic and took everyone into consideration. He began to be called first in the village. In the other, the son seemed pensive and sluggish, and people began to call him the second. The first cut and hauled off the young forest the father had planted to market. He bought a truck, to replace the horse, and a small tractor. The son of the first neighbor was considered enterprising. The entrepreneur determined that in the coming year the price of garlic was going to rise sharply. He wasn't wrong. He pulled out all the plantings from his land and sowed a field with garlic. Since they had given their word, the father and mother tried to help their son in everything. The family sold the garlic at a large profit. They began to build a huge house of modern materials with a hired crew. Still, the son-entrepreneur would not let up and calculated from morning until night what would be most profitable to plant in the field come spring. By winter's end he had determined that most profitable of all would be to sow the field in onions. Once again he sold his crop profitably, bought himself a car, and thought himself elegant.</p><p>
"One day, the sons of the two neighbors met on the road through the fields. One drove a car, the other a wagon harnessed to a frisky mare. The successful entrepreneur stopped his car, and a conversation took place between the two neighbors.</p><p>
"'Look, neighbor, I'm driving an elegant car, and you're still getting around in a cart. I'm building a big house, and you're living in your father's old one. Our fathers and mothers were always friends, and I too want to give you neighborly help. If you want, I'll suggest what's most profitable to sow your field with.'</p><p>
"'Thank you for your desire to be helpful,' the second neighbor answered from his cart, 'but I treasure only freedom for my thoughts.'</p><p>
"'Then I will not encroach upon the freedom of your thoughts. I only sincerely want to help you.'</p><p>
"'Thank you for your sincerity, too, good neighbor. The inanimate—the car you're sitting in, for instance—takes away from freedom of thought.'</p><p>
"'How can a car take that away? It can easily overtake your wagon, and while you're still riding to town, I can accomplish my business, all thanks to my car.'</p><p>
"'Yes, your car can overtake my wagon, of course, but at the same time you are sitting behind the wheel and forced to hold on continuously, and you are constantly fiddling with switches as you go, looking at the instruments and the road the whole time. My horse goes slower than an automobile, but at the same time I don't have to do anything with it, so I'm not distracted from the movement of my thought. I can fall asleep and the horse will run home itself. You said you had problems with gasoline. The horse finds fodder in the pasture itself. Not only that, tell me where you're in such a hurry to get to in your car?'</p><p>
"'I want to buy spare parts in advance. I know what might break down in my car soon.'</p><p>
"'So you mean you have learned so much about equipment that you can even picture all future breakdowns accurately?'</p><p>
"'Yes, I have! I studied equipment in special courses for three years. You remember, I invited you to attend the courses, too.'</p><p>
"'You gave your thought over to this equipment for three years. Equipment that breaks down and gets old.'</p><p>
"'Your horse will get old and die, too.'</p><p>
"'Yes, of course, it will. But before that it will give birth to a foal. It will grow up, and I will ride it. The animate serves man forever, but the dead only cuts his time short.'</p><p>
"'The whole village thinks your opinions strange. Everyone considers me successful and rich and you living merely at the expense of your aged father. You haven't even changed the look of the trees and bushes a tiny bit on your father's land.'</p><p>
"'But I loved them. I tried to understand the purpose of all of them and the connections between them. I encouraged those starting to wither with my gaze and touch. Now everything will bloom this spring in accord, by itself, requiring no intervention, merely thirsting to offer up its fruits by summer and fall.'</p><p>
"'Truly, my friend, you are an odd one.' The entrepreneur sighed. 'You are always walking around and admiring your homestead, your orchard and flowers. You say in this way that you are presenting your thoughts with freedom?'</p><p>
"'Yes.'</p><p>
"'But why do you need free thought? What is the point of freedom of thought?'</p><p>
"'In order to know all the great creations. To be happier, to help you.'</p><p>
"'Help me? You really have gone too far! I can take the best maiden in the village for my wife. Any of them would marry me. Everyone wants to be rich, to live in a spacious house and ride in my car.'</p><p>
"'Being rich does not mean being happy.'</p><p>
"'And being poor?'</p><p>
"'Being poor isn't good, either.'</p><p>
"'Neither poor nor rich, then what?'</p><p>
"'Everyone needs enough. It is not bad to have a sufficiency as well, and an awareness of what is going on around you. After all, happiness does not come to people all of a sudden.'</p><p>
"The entrepreneur grinned and drove away quickly. A year later, the two neighbor fathers met to consult. They decided it was time to find brides for their sons. When asked which of the village girls he would like to take for a wife, the son entrepreneur answered his father, 'The daughter of the village elder is to my taste, and I want to take her for my wife.'</p><p>
"'I see, my son, you have done wonderfully. The daughter of the village elder is the most beautiful in the entire district. Everyone who comes to visit our village from nearby villages and distant places goes into raptures when they see her. However, she is willful, you know. Even her parents cannot understand the mind of this unusual maiden. She could even be considered strange. Women from different villages have started coming to this young maiden more and more for advice and healing from their illnesses, and they are bringing their children as well.'</p><p>
"'What of it, father? I am nobody's fool, either. In our village there is no home more spacious, no car better, than mine. In addition, I have twice seen her look at me long and hard.'</p><p>
"The second father asked his son the same question.</p><p>
"'Who in the village is most to your liking, son?'</p><p>
"The youth replied, 'I love the daughter of the village elder, father.'</p><p>
"'What does she think of you, my son? Have you seen her loving gaze?'</p><p>
"'No, father. When I met her by chance, the maiden lowered her eyelashes.'</p><p>
"The two neighbors decided to go together to propose marriage for their sons. They came and sat down in a dignified way.</p><p>
"The village elder called in his daughter and said to her, 'Here, my daughter, matchmakers have come to see you, from two young men wishing to take you for a wife. We have come to a joint decision to let you determine which of the two is your chosen one. Can you tell us who he is right away or will you take until dawn to think it over?'</p><p>
"'I have spent quite a few dawns in dreams, Father,' the young maiden said softly, 'and I can give you an answer right away.'</p><p>
"'Then speak, we are all waiting impatiently.'</p><p>
"The beauty answered the matchmakers who had come as follows.</p><p>
"'Thank you, fathers, for your attention. Thank you to the matchmakers' sons for their desire to join their life to mine. You have raised handsome sons, fathers, and the choice as to which of the two to entrust my fate to might be difficult. But I want to bear children and I want my children to be happy. I want my children to live in plenty, in freedom and love, and so I have come to love the one who is richest of all.'</p><p>
"The entrepreneur's father rose proudly. The second father sat with downcast eyes. But the maiden walked up to the second father, knelt before him, and said, without raising her eyelashes, 'I want to live with your son.'</p><p>
"The village elder rose from his seat as well. He wanted to see his daughter living in the house considered the finest in the village and so said sternly, 'You have spoken correctly, my daughter. Your prudence has brought joy to a father's heart, but you did not approach and kneel to the richest in the village. The richest here is the other. Here he is.'</p><p>
"The elder, pointing to the entrepreneur's father, added, 'Their son has built a spacious house. They have a car, a tractor, and money.'</p><p>
"The maiden moved closer to her father.</p><p>
"'Naturally, you are right, dear papa. But I was talking about children. What good will there be for children in the things you listed? The tractor will break down while they are growing up. The car will rust, and the house will fall into decay.'</p><p>
"'That may be, but the children will have a lot of money, and they will acquire a new tractor, and car, and clothing.'</p><p>
"'How much is "a lot," I wonder?'</p><p>
"The entrepreneur's father proudly smoothed his mustache and beard and answered gravely. 'My son has so much money that if necessary he could immediately buy three farms like the one he already has. Furthermore, we can acquire not only two horses like the ones our neighbor has, but an entire herd.'</p><p>
"Modestly lowering her eyelashes, the maiden replied, "I wish you and your son happiness, but there is not enough money on the whole Earth that could buy a father's garden, where each twig reaches out with love to the person who raised it. Money cannot buy the loyalty of a horse that played with your child as a foal. Your homestead will bring money. The homestead of my beloved will bring a sufficiency and love.'"</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Priest Changes His Tactics</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"In the thousand-year war, the priest changed his tactics more than once, always unsuccessfully. Rus' still laughed at his occult attempts. The people called those preachers wretched. At the time, occultism, not physical crippling, was considered wretched. People in Rus' felt sorry for the wretched preachers, fed them, and gave them shelter, but did not take their words seriously.</p><p>
"Four hundred centuries later, the priest realized he could gain victory over a Vedian country. He determined precisely where Vedism's unusual strength lay.</p><p>
"Vedism was rooted firmly in Divine culture. The way of life was divine for each person. Each family created a dimension of Love on its homestead and felt the wholeness of nature—in other words, everything God created.</p><p>
"In Vedism, people basically spoke with God through nature. They did not worship Him, they tried to understand God and love Him, as sons and daughters love their good parents.</p><p>
"The priest created a plan capable of interrupting the dialog with the Divine. For this, people had to be separated from their homesteads, from their Divine gardens, their joint creation with God. The entire territory where Veds lived had to be broken up into states and their culture destroyed.</p><p>
"Other preachers went to Rus'. Their actions were different. Now they tried to seek out people in whom self-esteem—pride—predominated ever so slightly over their other emotional energies. Finding such a person, they tried to develop the pride in him. And that is what they did.</p><p>
"Imagine, a group of noble-looking old men comes into a home where a family is living happily but they make no attempt as before to preach or teach them how to live. On the contrary, they suddenly bow to the head of the family, offer up unusual gifts, and say, 'We have climbed to a high mountain in a country far away. There is no mountain higher in all the Earth. When we stood at the top, which is higher than the clouds, a voice announced itself to us from the heavens. It said that you were wiser than anyone else on Earth. You alone have been chosen, and it would be an honor for us to worship you, offer you gifts, and listen to your wise word.'</p><p>
"If they saw someone had fallen for their trap, they continued their cunning speech: 'You must make all people happy. That is what the voice on the mountain told us. You should not spend your precious time on other actions. You must govern people. You alone are charged with deciding everything for them, and here is your heavenly headdress.'</p><p>
"At this, a headdress decorated with jewels was offered up to the man as the greatest treasure.</p><p>
"The headdress was hoisted onto the head of the man who believed in his own greatness and favored state. Immediately all the newcomers fell prostrate in great obeisance. They began to praise the heavens for having been given the honor to worship greatness. Then the newcomers built him a separate house that resembled a temple.</p><p>
"Thus the first princes appeared in Vedian Rus'.</p><p>
"The neighbors looked at the man seated on the temple throne as they would a curiosity. They watched the foreigners bow to him, indulge his every whim, and ask many questions.</p><p>
"At first, taking their actions for a foreign game, the neighbors—some out of curiosity and others out of pity—decided to play up to the foreigners and to their neighbor. Gradually, however, the people were drawn into the game. Gradually they fell into bondage and unbeknownst to themselves were distracted from the creation of their thought.</p><p>
"The priest's emissaries had to invest quite a lot of effort into creating the principality. At first, for more than a hundred years, their attempts were unsuccessful. Nonetheless, it came to pass finally, and Vedian Rus' was divided into principalities.</p><p>
"A natural process followed: the princes began fighting among themselves for greatness and drawing their neighbors into internecine wars.</p><p>
"Later historians would write that great princes were found, that the separate principalities in Rus' were united into a powerful state. Think for yourself, Vladimir. Is that so? What union are the historians talking about? It's all very simple, in fact. One prince was able to kill or conquer the others. Only culture, a way of life, can unite people.</p><p>
"The establishment of borders always attests to separation. A state formed based not on the culture of a way of life, but on the artificial greatness of one or a few people and the power of their armies, engendered many problems, chief among them how to maintain the borders and, if possible, extend them. Thus the need for a large army arose.</p><p>
"One person cannot govern a large state alone. Clerks and scribes appeared and multiplied, and to this day there are more and more of them. The princes, clerks, scribes, merchants, and all their service staff are a category of people torn away from God's creations. Now their purpose is the creation of an artificial world. They have lost the ability to perceive true reality, and they are the soil for occultism.</p><p>
"Just one thousand years ago, Rus' was considered pagan. Paganism still preserved a little of the meaning of the Divine Vedian culture. With the appearance of princes and small, then large, appanage principalities, rulers required a force more powerful than an army, a force which could create a type of person inclined to resigned subordination.</p><p>
"Here, too, the priest's couriers came to the aid of the princes and offered a suitable religion.</p><p>
"The princes' liked the new state of things, although there was little that was new. It had everything Egypt had five thousand years before.</p><p>
"The prince, like the pharaoh, was considered God's minion. The occult servants of the new religion were his advisors, as it had been in Egypt. Everyone else was merely a slave. It was not easy to inculcate something like this in the minds of free people, whose memory still retained the holidays of the Vedian culture. Once again the priest came to the princes' aid. His soldiers began spreading a false rumor about how human sacrifice to God was being practiced more and more often among the pagans.</p><p>
"They claimed that the pagans offered up as sacrifice to their gods not only various animals, but also beautiful young girls, young men, and sometimes even small children. This slander has survived down to the present day. It angered the pagan people more and more. Here a new religion strictly banning sacrifice was proposed to the people. It spoke of equality and brotherhood, with the exception of the princes, of course. Thus, gradually, the new religion was introduced in pagan Rus'. Later, one of the ruling princes proclaimed Christianity as the sole true religion and banned all the others.</p><p>
"Now let each person whose ancestors, whose mothers and fathers, were pagans just a thousand years ago ask himself whether animals or men were in fact offered up by the pagans to please their gods. The true essence of what is going on will arise before each person who himself, with his own logic, can reason for at least nine minutes.</p><p>
"And you, Vladimir, you yourself can see the truth by calling on your own logic for discovering the truth. I will help you a little.</p><p>
"First, ask yourself a logical question. If the pagans, as they were accused, were offering someone up as sacrifice to God, why did even the rumor of sacrifices disturb their mind and feelings, too? It is more logical to welcome something like this and zealously try to repeat it, rather than be disturbed, and thus not accept a new religion. But the people were disturbed. Why? Naturally, because even the pagans had no thought of and did not accept animal sacrifice, let alone human sacrifice.</p><p>
"This is why no one to this day can present a single source which says that there were sacrifices among the people of pagan Rus'. Only the chroniclers of Christianity speak about this. But after all, they did not live in pagan Rus'. After all, they do not know even the language of pagan Rus'. Where are the sources and manuscripts of that pagan Rus'? Some were hidden, and some were destroyed in bonfires, as in Rome. What was so seditious in those scrolls? What did they proclaim? Not having read them, each person today can only guess. They would reveal the lie in the accusation against paganism, and they might convey a true knowledge of Vedism. The whole point is that the people of all pagan Rus' not only did not know blood sacrifice, they did not eat meat at all. They could not even contemplate that. The pagans were friends with the animals, and their daily food ration was varied but consisted only of plants. Who can produce a single recipe of a Russian dish from the ancient cuisine that contains meat? No one!</p><p>
"Even the legends say that the turnip was respected in Rus' and that they drank honey-beer. Let modern people who eat meat take a taste of the warm honey beverage, with flower pollen and herbs, and after that they will want to eat nothing else, let alone meat. If they are forced, many people end up vomiting from meat.</p><p>
"In addition, judge for yourself, Vladimir, why would they need to eat meat if so many different foods, high in calories, were easily at hand?</p><p>
"The bee feeds in winter on nothing but honey and pollen. The bee does not defecate in the hive all winter.</p><p>
"The bee's organism digests the entire product. People offered their guests sbiten—a beverage brewed with honey—as soon as they came to their house. Who is going to eat meat after something sweet? Nomads introduced meat as food to the world. In the deserts and steppes, they could not find a lot to eat, which is why they killed their livestock, and ate the meat of the animals that bore the burdens of the nomadic life with them, hauled their goods, fed them milk, and gave them their wool for clothing.</p><p>
"In this way, the culture of our forefathers was destroyed and Rus' was plunged into religion. Had it been authentic, Christ's alone, life today might have been different. But the priest introduced his own traps in Christ's religion, and one religion became subject to various interpretations, dividing the Christian world into many confessions and bringing them into conflict with each other. The high priest expended quite a lot of effort on Rus'. In other places on Earth, people saw his actions and did not let the preachers inside their borders. Japan, China, and India did not become Christian, but the high priest conquered them by other means. The millennium of Occultism came one thousand years ago. People of all the Earth lived in it. And they are living in it to this day."</p><p>

"It has lasted just one millennium.</p><p>
"Since the period of Occultism, humanity has been plunged into an unreal world.</p><p>
"Humanity has begun to spend a huge amount of energy on farfetched images and abstract worlds located beyond the limits of real life. The real world, with all its diversity, receives less and less life-giving human warmth. It continues its existence at the expense of the accumulations of the past and the initial Divine supply.</p><p>
"Humanity has ceased to carry out its main purpose to the extent and is becoming dangerous for the Universe, and there have been disasters on a planetary scale.</p><p>
"All humanity lives in an occult world today, too. But it ended in the year 2000. Of course, the year's name is not in fact 2000.</p><p>
"You yourself know that only recently they changed the calendar. The previous chronological boundary was the millionth anniversary of earthly civilization.</p><p>
"As always, a disaster on a planetary scale should have occurred, or rather, humanity should have begun to prepare for mastering the Universe through its own perfection. However, a disaster has not occurred in any occult year.</p><p>
"A mere three of the Veds who had not fallen asleep were able to lift some of the occult sleeping spells from present-day people. You must remember how the hearts of those who read your books began to tremble and recall their love for the land. They are still asleep, but the power of the God's Vedian culture is returning to them. Hope is returning to God. With their love, though not yet completely awake, they averted disaster. Now it will not happen on our planet.</p><p>
"Soon, all people will come out of the hypnotic occult dream. They will begin to return to reality.</p><p>
"Are you surprised that humanity today is sleeping under hypnosis or residing in an unreal world? You think, 'How can that be? Here I am, and in the cities, great and small, many people reside. Cars drive down the streets.'</p><p>
"You must not be in any hurry to be surprised at what I say, Vladimir. Think for yourself, judge for yourself, what kind of season, day, or hour, present-day people reside in the real world. For example, recall how many different religions exist in the world. They interpret man's essence and the world order differently, and each has its own array of rites different from the others.</p><p>
"Let's say that one religion is the truest of them all. This means that the rest are building an unreal world. Yet people also believe in them, after all, and if they do, they are living by obeying the laws of an unreal world.</p><p>
"All over the Earth, more and more people are trying to get more and more money. Yet what is money but a convention? People wrongly believe that anything can be bought for money. This is an illusion. No one has ever bought for money the true energy of Love, a mother's emotion, a Homeland, or the taste of fruits intended only for whoever consciously cultivated them.</p><p>
"Money is a convention and can buy only the convention of love. If you surround yourself with many soulless things for money, you condemn your soul to loneliness.</p><p>
"In the occult millennium, humanity has been wholly disoriented with respect to the dimension created by God, and human souls have raced around as if in the dark.</p><p>
"You must look closely, Vladimir. In the last century alone, society has changed its guidelines drastically even in the country where you now live.</p><p>
"There was a tsar and secular laws. Respected people were marked with various badges and medals and colorful orders with ribbons. They wore embroidered uniforms. Monasteries and temples were built throughout the country. Suddenly all this was deemed a monstrosity. The uniforms and the beribboned orders came to be considered clown costumes; temples, obscurantism; the servants of those temples, swindlers.</p><p>
"People destroyed the temples enthusiastically and killed the occult servants ferociously. Then it was announced to everyone that only Soviet power was to blame for this. Yes, the state issued a call about this to the people, but after all, the people did not resist. They responded to the call of their leader-idols.</p><p>
"You know from documents that exist to this day how forty-two Christian priests were brutally murdered in the Kuban. And they were not simply murdered but viciously tortured. Their bodies were tossed into latrines. It was not the leaders who did all this; the people themselves wanted this action. The leaders merely granted permission for these actions. As a result, clergy at different ends of the country were murdered by the thousands. Some were unable to flee and renounced their faith. In those days, very few could preserve both their life and their faith.</p><p>
"Most people in the country became sincere atheists. Clothing changed. The pins and bows changed shape and color. Quite a few analysts and historians have written books about the Soviet years, but when humanity eventually has to hear about Lenin and Stalin, just one thing will be on our descendants' lips: 'For the first time, humanity was clearly shown that occultism had outlived itself. Even asleep, the people do not accept occult religions, and occultism is maintained by artificial, violent means.' Yet, belief in God was not destroyed. Instead, the occultism that had permeated their faith was brought low.</p><p>
"In the last millennium, in Russia alone, rulers succeeded at changing the nation's philosophy. They brought religion very low and transferred it into a belief in communism, although that is a faith as well.</p><p>
"Quite recently—and you are witness to this—once again the people of your country have drastically changed their principles. The path which they had followed with such joy was deemed incorrect, and once again priorities changed.</p><p>
"Have the people really chosen a new path? Not a bit! The path is unclear to the people in general. In the occult, unreal world, people themselves do not choose their path. Someone always points it out: the high priest, who rules the world even today.</p><p>
"How does he gain control over people today? Why can't anyone overthrow him? Where is he? I can show him to you."</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The High Priest, Who Rules the World Even Today</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"Right now, you see an elderly man. Do not wonder at his simple appearance. He does not differ from others in his clothing or conduct, and in his daily life he is surrounded by ordinary things. His house is not that big—two people are his entire staff. He has a family: a wife and two sons. But even his family doesn't know who he really is. Nonetheless, there is one outward difference between him and everyone else. If you observe him closely, you can see that he spends his whole day in seclusion, and on his face you can mark the depth of his contemplation. When he eats, he speaks with his wife, although conversation is infrequent, and his eyes look as though they're covered with a foggy film. Even when he watches television, his eyelids are slightly closed, and he is never surprised and never laughs. In fact, he barely watches television. He just pretends to watch, while he intensively thinks his own thoughts. He is constructing grandiose plans and controlling the actions of entire countries. He is the high priest of the dynasty of priests, having inherited occult knowledge, which he can also hand down to one of his sons. In the space of a single year, he can orally transmit everything to his heir, whom, unknown to the boy himself, he is training in secret. The priest has long been developing certain capabilities in his own son.</p><p>
"All the money in the world belongs to the high priest. All the money in the world works for him, even the money now in your pocket. Don't be surprised. I will show you how this happens and why the high priest prefers to live not in a castle, surrounded by a battalion of guards, and why he prefers ordinary life to luxury.</p><p>
"The high priest has no guard because he knows full well that the more visible power is to everyone, the greater the need for protection. The ruler of no land on earth can protect himself with guards, even an army of a hundred thousand. After all, there have been instances when the guard betrayed or killed the ruler. In addition, a guard is a lot of trouble. At certain moments, the ruler must submit to the guards' conditions and inform the guard of his intentions, his upcoming movements, for example.</p><p>
"With a guard, a man is always under observation, and therefore it is hard for him to reflect.</p><p>
"More reliable and simpler is to conceal one's essence. In this way, one excludes the intrigues of opponents, rivals for power, and fanatics.</p><p>
"Now you're thinking, 'How can one govern so many people without aides, clerks, or deputies, without writing laws or punishing those guilty of not carrying them out?'</p><p>
"It's all very simple. Most people have been submerged in occultism for a long time.</p><p>
"The high priest knows occultism's methods. He does have aides, clerks, law scribes, executioners, and prisoners. He has armies and commanders, but none of them carrying out his will even suspects who commands them invisibly or how he issues his orders.</p><p>
"Meanwhile, the invisible and contact-free system of governance is simple.</p><p>
"In each country, in cities great and small, there are people who suddenly start hearing voices coming from no one knows where. Such a voice, of unknown origin, may tell a person to carry out some action, and the person obeys the order.</p><p>
"Sometimes the voice is perfectly audible; sometimes the auditor himself has little idea of what is happening to him. An unusual desire arises, and he carries out the action according to the order.</p><p>
"This phenomenon is well known to modern science. Both psychiatrists and representatives of other sciences have long tried to study its nature, but without success.</p><p>
"Modern science has deemed this type of phenomenon a psychiatric illness. Doctors always try to hospitalize people who come to see them and say they hear voices coming from nowhere giving them orders. What kind of hospital? What is called a psychiatric clinic. In many countries, it resembles a prison. There are many such clinics in present-day America, Europe, and Russia. The people in them are treated with various pills and injections, to calm the psyche. These medicines make them sleep for a long time. The person becomes listless and dulled. Some people obviously do stop hearing the voice. Others lie to the doctors in order to get out of the clinic-prisons.</p><p>
"But not everyone who hears a voice goes to a doctor. Now imagine that such a person who obeys a voice controls a nuclear missile, commands an army, safeguards a vat of lethal bacteria, and the voice gives him a special order. . . .</p><p>
"Science has not been able to define the nature of the unusual phenomenon. It obviously exists today, but they are afraid to publicize it, and for good reason. Meanwhile, it has long been essential to give thought to something simple: if there is a receiver receiving a signal, then somewhere there must be a broadcaster.</p><p>
"The high priest and his aides know a means for broadcasting voice-commands. They also know the type of people many religions can shape. Priests are the founders of religions and occultism. The need it in order to control people. A fanatic who believes in the unreal world is like a biorobot, and he is predisposed to hearing voice-commands and unhesitatingly carrying out any order.</p><p>
"The high priest and his aides know how to stir up people of different faiths and set them to fighting each other.</p><p>
"The causes of wars are varied, but in any war the differences between faiths have always been a basic weapon.</p><p>
"The technical means, everything that disseminates information artificially as well as through people, is in the priests' power. For this they do not need to direct every television broadcast or guide an author's hand across the paper. They need only to create general conditions so that all the media strive to work for money. Advertising various goods on television, for example, has become more and more widespread, persistent, and aggressive. Any psychologist will tell you that it is nothing but aggressive suggestion aimed at people, often to their harm rather than to their good. They unabashedly try to convince people that television is impossible without the money advertising brings in. Meanwhile the person watching television pays for all advertising when he buys goods at an ad's suggestion. The price of the good includes money for advertising. What can be sadder than that situation?</p><p>
"The money serves as a huge and powerful lever of influence for the priest.</p><p>
"I told you that even the money in your pocket serves the high priest. Here is how all this happens.</p><p>
"The entangled banking system has one simple law. The money someone borrows from the bank increases the bank's capital. For instance, when Russia takes out a loan from the World Bank, it must repay with high interest, much more than it borrowed. Where does the difference come from? You pay taxes. Even if a nonworking old man buys himself a hunk of bread, the price also includes a percentage of tax. That percentage will be paid back, some of it even to the World Bank. In this way, capital flourishes. But whose capital? The high priest's. Without touching the capital, he can direct the streams of money into wars or occult matters or produce lethal medicines.</p><p>
"His goal is simple! Pride predominates in him, and it strives to create its own world separate from the world created by God and to hold it in submission. The priests succeed at getting their wishes in part. Vanity among people helps them in this, and the priests themselves create such vanity.</p><p>
"Notice that, in their vanity, people do not notice that they are receiving less and less information. A stricter and stricter ban is being placed on one question: Is the path down which all humanity is striving correct?</p><p>
"Once freed from vanity, many might be able to determine that if with each year illnesses increase among people, war doesn't end, and the disaster grows bigger each passing day, then the path we are following is dubious. But the vanity doesn't allow for thinking, while the priest is thinking every minute, making plans, and carrying them out with the hands of many people."</p><p>
For a long time I listened to Anastasia's agitated tale, not interrupting her, asking questions, or seeking clarification. This time I spent longer in the taiga than usual. When I was leaving, I realized I had been overloaded by the amount of information and I would have a hard time setting it forth in a book. In addition, she said things that were too unusual, and she touched on religion and power. A great many fanatics of all kinds profess various religions. They are prepared to attack anyone who encroaches on their belief. What do I need these problems for?</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0609>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>9. We Must Think</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div>
</p><p>
At home, while I prepared the book for the publisher, up to the very last moment I could not decide whether I should include all her statements in the manuscript.</p><p>
When Anastasia spoke about Russia's beautiful future, which could be achieved through the setting up of homesteads, everything she said was comprehensible. Readers picked up on her idea. People began to act.</p><p>
When, in Who Are We?, she agitatedly answered that question and called Jesus Christ her older brother, some readers, primarily believing Christians, began to express dissatisfaction.</p><p>
In the previous book, I wrote that in response to the question as to whether any clergy could understand her she had answered that she would be helped by Pope John II. At that point, certain Catholic readers began to have doubts.</p><p>
Statements of this kind left me with doubts as well. Should I write in the books about Anastasia's unusual actions, words, and behavior? Would they bring benefit or harm? Wouldn't some readers come to doubt obvious real ideas for arranging society by improving the well-being and way of life of individual families?</p><p>
I myself had doubts about what she said, too. Does she really have to say "Jesus Christ's sister" and "Pope John II will help"?</p><p>
If you look through the entire Bible, nowhere does it mention Jesus Christ having any brothers or sisters.</p><p>
Suddenly an event occurred that could be called supersensational, and in connection with this, Anastasia's unusual statements forced us again to think hard about the greatness of man's true possibilities. Here is what happened.</p><p>
Suddenly, I received information about the Vatican talking about Jesus Christ's two sisters. Or it may have been cousins. I heard a short news item when I was alone in my apartment busy with some everyday task.</p><p>
The radio and television were on simultaneously so I cannot say for certain where it came from. I think it was the television news.</p><p>
After this, each time I sat down at my desk for some reason I picked up my notes with Anastasia's unusual statements, which I had previously decided not to include in the new book. I rethought my decision carefully. These statements included the following:</p><p>
"U.S. President George Bush, by one nonstandard action, without himself realizing it, will save his country from a terrible disaster and protect the world from a war unprecedented in its destructive effect."</p><p>
This statement of Anastasia's after the devastating terrorist acts in the United States on September 11 and the military operation, what was basically a war, in Afghanistan with direct U.S. participation, turned out to wholly contradict what happened in reality. However, analyzing the information reported in the press and on television, I was more and more convinced that the events of September 11 in America should reveal a grave secret to people: to avert larger-scale, global terrorist acts in various countries. They would be averted only if this secret was revealed. Over and over again I reread all of Anastasia's unusual statements. Here is what came out of that.</p><p>
On September 11, 2001, a series of large-scale terrorist acts was carried out in the United States. Passenger planes carrying people flew from New York airports and immediately changed their assigned route. One after another, the planes hit the skyscrapers of the World Trade Center and other strategically important sites.</p><p>
People from different countries heard all about this. More than once, they saw the terrible picture of devastation on television. Soon after this event, it was determined that the main perpetrator was Osama bin Laden and his organization. A little later, the President and the U.S. government, with the approval and participation of several European countries, including Russia, began to bomb Afghanistan, where, according to the information in their possession, the main terrorist and members of his organization were based.</p><p>
So what is the secret? After all, footage showing the consequences of the terrorist acts and the course of the antiterrorist military operation have been shown and are still used in reporting several times a day.</p><p>
The secret lies in the total absence or concealment of the reason for the terrorist acts, in the total absence of logic in the actions not of the terrorist act's perpetrators but of their commanders and planners.</p><p>
The secret lies in the fact that the press has not even attempted to analyze at all significantly the reasons for what occurred, as if all the media had been prohibited from shedding light on this issue. Daily they show and talk to us merely about the fact of what occurred. The constant repetitions are making the extraordinary ordinary, familiar, like the daily reports on highway accidents.</p><p>
Based on media reports, the following picture takes shape. According to the accepted version, a certain very wealthy terrorist, Osama bin Laden, prepared and through his agents carried out a series of high-profile terrorist acts that killed a large number of victims and had an unprecedented effect on people all over the world.</p><p>
What result did Osama bin Laden reap? Some of the world's heads of state united against him, deploying the most modern technical means and best-trained military units to catch and destroy him.</p><p>
According to most, the number one terrorist is hiding in the mountain caves of Afghanistan. Planes bomb those mountains, as well as the Taliban forces considered to be helping him.</p><p>
The most developed countries, led by the United States, at the same time are preparing to put an end to all terrorist camps, in whatever country these camps are located.</p><p>
Couldn't the person who is the organizer of the terrorist act have foreseen this outcome? It's madness. Of course, he realized that precisely this would happen. It was not hard for someone capable of hiding from security forces for an extended period of time and of planning and carrying out terrorist acts requiring serious analysis and calculation to figure out that events would develop in this way.</p><p>
Thus, on the one hand, he seems a cunning strategist and tactician and a highly refined analyst and, on the other, a total fool. By his terrorist actions, he brought ruin down on himself, his organization, and all terrorist organizations, even those not connected to him.</p><p>
It is an illogical situation, and consequently the actions of the world community to fight terrorism could be inefficient and, in the larger analysis, dangerous. Logic speaks to the fact that the terrorist act's main organizer remains beyond suspicion.</p><p>
Be that as it may, one thing is clear: the facts offered up by the media create precisely this alogical picture of what happened.</p><p>
Of course, like many people, at first I paid no attention to this, but what happened in the United States brought back to mind a few of Anastasia's statements, statements that I had not wanted to publish due to how unusual and strange they were. Now, however, after the American events, it is they that explained a great deal, although far from right away. Here, for instance, is one of them.</p><p>
"Since the times of the Egyptian pharaohs, the rulers of states great and small have been the most unfree people on Earth. They spend most of their time in an artificial information field and are forced to submit to generally accepted rituals of conduct. A huge volume of typical, monotonous information comes to them constantly, but the time factor does not allow them to analyze it. A shift by a ruler of state from the artificial information field to the natural one, even for a few days, is dangerous for the priests of various levels. Among other things, it is dangerous for the ruler's secular rivals. The danger is that the ruler might begin to analyze many processes independently and thus free both himself and his nation from the rule of the occult.</p><p>
"The natural information field is nature, its look, smells, and sounds. A person can be wholly fenced off from occult influences on him by the nature on his own homestead, the place where the flora and fauna treat him with love."</p><p>
Now, as I sat behind the cedar desk Anastasia gave me and recalled this statement, it did not seem strange to me, as it had before.</p><p>
Indeed, look at what is happening just with our president, constantly meeting with foreign heads of state or with domestic officials. All of them are coming not for a cup of tea but with various problems for which they're seeking an immediate solution. And the press? No sooner does some out-of-the-ordinary event occur in the country than the press is immediately asking, What is the president's reaction? Or, more biting, Why hasn't the president gone to the scene of the event? He wins approval if he goes to the scene of the disaster. But is this good?</p><p>
When can he think calmly and analyze the incoming information? "Give us the president!" the people demand the moment anything happens. That is what we have come to expect. It is practically the rule. But what if the rule were different? The president shouldn't be rushing around like a firefighter. He shouldn't be receiving officials and wasting time on meetings.</p><p>
He must be given the opportunity to sit in his own garden and from there contemplate what is happening in the country, and analyze the incoming information. He should take certain decisions rarely. Maybe then the people would start to live better. "What nonsense is this?" many will probably think, as I did at first. Nonsense? And the fact that the man is not allowed to think is all right? It is to someone's great advantage that presidents of different countries think as little as possible. What would happen to our country if we let our president think calmly and stopped pestering him, if we gave him the opportunity, at least for a time, to step out of the artificial information field?</p><p>
And suddenly! At this thought, it felt as though a current had run through my body, and my desk became warm. An incredible guess. I was so agitated, for some reason I picked up the phone and without dialing, because she doesn't have a phone, I cried out, "Anastasia!"</p><p>
The receiver did not make the usual dial tone. A moment later, I clearly heard a familiar voice, Anastasia pure and calm voice, different from all the voices in the world: "Hello, Vladimir. You must try not to get so terribly agitated. You see for yourself what unnatural actions excessive agitation evokes. I am not going to talk to you over the telephone. Please, calm yourself. Get up from your desk, go out into the fresh air, into the woods around your house."</p><p>
The receiver started beeping. I put the receiver back.</p><p>
"She's right," I thought, "don't get so agitated. I wonder whether that was really Anastasia talking or was I so agitated I imagined it? I really must get some fresh air and calm myself."</p><p>
A little while later, I got dressed and went into the woods located next to my house, went deep into them, and saw Anastasia standing under a pine, a little off the path, and smiling. Paying no attention to her unusual appearance, I immediately began talking.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Who Saved America</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"Anastasia, I understand. I've analyzed and compared your statements and the events that occurred in America, and it's become clear to me. Listen, and if I make a mistake, correct me. The series of terrorist acts that occurred on September 11 in America was incomplete. Their organizers were planning something significantly bigger. Right? Yes?</p><p>
"Of course, it's right. Only I can't imagine the details. Basically, I think, I've learned. But the details. Can you supply more detail?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"Tell me."</p><p>
"The main organizer was planning to initiate six terrorist groups in sequence. Each of the six groups was supposed to act independently at an individually scheduled time. Each knew nothing about the other, and their leaders did not know who was in charge or the ultimate goal. Each group included religious fanatics prepared to die.</p><p>
"Only one group consisted of people who had agreed to commit their evil deed for money.</p><p>
"The first group was supposed to seize all civil aircraft in the air over the country at the same time, as well as those taking off from airports and coming into the country to land. The plan was to send all the captured planes to destroy the country's important sites.</p><p>
"Six days before this, another group was supposed to poison the water supply of the twenty largest hotels. They came up with a way so that it was almost impossible to determine the pollution's source or the perpetrator. The perpetrator was supposed to take a room in one of the biggest hotels, attach a special device to the cold water tap, and open the tap. Water would not flow out. On the contrary, the air pressure would force a lethal powder into the water supply system. After this, the tap gets closed and the next morning the evildoer moves to a hotel in another city.</p><p>
"When the bacteria got into the water supply and came in contact with water, they would stick to the walls of pipes, swell, multiply, and trickle down. Twelve days later there would be a lot of them. They could not multiply in an ordinary, natural water environment. Other bacteria would destroy them. But a water supply system doesn't have this problem. Man has removed many of water's natural properties.</p><p>
"During the greatest water demand, when people went to wash in the morning, the stream of water would break off some of the bacteria, and polluted water would flow from the tap. The person washing with it would not feel anything right away. Eight or twelve days later, however, lesions would start to appear on his body. They would increase in size and number and then fester. The disease is infectious and difficult to treat. The terrorist act's organizers have an antidote. There would be sick people in many countries. Soon, it would become clear that the sick people had stayed in hotels. This was supposed to come out after the airplanes fell.</p><p>
"I find it unpleasant to relate what other evil deeds terrorists were supposed to commit. All the terrorist acts together were supposed to incite fear and panic.</p><p>
"Many families would start to leave the country and would try to move their capital into the banks of countries they thought less dangerous to live in, but not every country would agree to accept American refugees. Horror and fear would grip the population of most countries, if the country considered the most powerful could not withstand . . ."</p><p>
"Stop, Anastasia. I'll try myself. After this they, the main organizers, would immediately declare themselves. I mean, they would advance their demands through intermediaries."</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"But they were unable to carry out all their plans. They couldn't frighten Americans entirely. They couldn't accomplish all they had contemplated because they were forced to begin before all the preparations were complete. That's why it ended up being illogical. There were terrorist acts but no demands. They failed, and I can guess why. The main people, the absolutely main people, now live among the priests, and they were frightened by Bush's actions and forced to act too soon. Right?"</p><p>
"Yes. They—"</p><p>
"Wait, Anastasia. I have to understand it all myself. I have to learn to understand. This is very important. If I can do it, that means others like me will also be able to see the reality in which we live. That means everyone will understand what must be done to improve life."</p><p>
"Yes, Vladimir, if you can, then others can, too—some sooner, some later—but people will begin to build their life in a beautiful reality. You must speak, only more calmly, and you mustn't get so terribly agitated."</p><p>
"Yes, I'm barely agitated at all now. Though, no. It's hard here without agitation. Well, of course. America's President Bush stirred up quite a commotion for those know-it-alls. I realize that they were horrified when he suddenly left for his ranch in Texas. It had only been six months since he'd become President. Suddenly, he takes vacation and leaves for nearly a month. And where does he go? Not to a fashionable resort, not to some exotic castle. He goes to his ranch, where he has a small house. There is not even a special security line, just one ordinary telephone. There aren't even many television channels, because there isn't any satellite antenna. Journalists and analysts spoke about these facts, but no one ever did realize what stood behind them. I read on the Internet about everything having to do with Bush's trip to his ranch. Only the fact itself was reported. Yes, people were surprised that he took vacation so early and for such a long time. He spent twenty-six days on his ranch without inviting journalists or various officials in.</p><p>
"And no one understood! America's President George Bush carried out a large-scale action unprecedented in the entire time of the country's existence. It may be that no single ruler in the last five or ten thousand years ever thought of doing anything like this."</p><p>
"No, they didn't."</p><p>
"Its grandeur consists in the fact that, for the first time, the ruler of a huge country, the most important country in the world, to the horror of priests of all stripes, suddenly broke out of the artificial information field. He just calmly left it. Consequently, he slipped from the occultists' control. Now I understand. Rulers are always kept under surveillance. Their daily statements, even their vocal intonations and facial expressions, are followed keenly. The priests adjust the rulers' actions by throwing all kinds of information at them. Bush went and left this field. The priests were horrified. They tried to get to him by occult means, to dictate to him long distance with their voice, as you said. No such luck. They couldn't! You said it, remember? You said that nature, flora, fauna—this is the natural world—and it does not allow harmful occult influences to reach man. It protects man if he comes into contact with the natural world. He creates it himself."</p><p>
"Yes. That really is true."</p><p>
"George Bush obviously did not create the vegetation on his ranch. But he chose the place himself. He loved it. He loved the nature there, which is clear from many facts. Nature responded to his love in kind. It protected him the way the vegetation of a homestead would. Is this possible, Anastasia, when you yourself don't plant it, but it reacts?"</p><p>
"It is. Sometimes it reacts if a person himself relates to his surroundings sincerely and with love. In this case, that is what happened with George Bush."</p><p>
"There. And I understood this. The president was on his ranch. Everyone believed he lacked information. In fact, however, the information stream from the artificial world decreased significantly, while the information stream from the surrounding natural world increased significantly. The president received it through the rustling of the leaves, the splashing of the water, the singing of the birds, and the blowing of the wind, and he pondered. He analyzed! He thought! They try to 'erase' this fact, to forget it, not to mention it. To change the subject. It won't work! It will still go down in the history of the millennia. I have understood, Anastasia. You can give many smart speeches. You can write many songs and poems, like the Biblical King Solomon, and you can act more vividly and convincingly, as Bush did, and thereby tell the world, 'Look, people, I am rich, I have supreme power over the most powerful country in the world. But all this is not the main thing for the human essence. Something else pleases the human soul and its Divine essence: not the world of artifice but the natural world created by God. My ranch is closer to my soul than gold and technocratic achievements. So I go to my ranch. Give real thought, people, to the aspirations in your life!' The American president made the best, most powerful, and most convincing advertisement for the homesteads you have been talking about—the future homesteads in Russia and in the rest of the world. If after this, people don't understand, then humanity really is asleep or under someone's hypnotic control. So they suffer, fall ill, use drugs, and make war, killing one another. If humanity does not come out from under this trance after what you've said and after Bush's actions, then a disaster is needed. Bush is the president. He is the best-informed person in our technocratic world because he has access to information from special services and analysis from think tanks. He also knows the information of the natural world. He can compare and analyze. He did compare and by his action showed . . . Stop. Another incredible chance incident. No, a whole series of chance incidents, if this really is chance. You said . . . You say it and then it happens. . . . At the beginning of the new millennium the Russian president will promulgate a law on land, so that each and every Russian family is given a hectare for free.</p><p>
"On February 21, 2001, all the television news programs broadcast a report from a session of the State Council under the chairmanship of Russian President V. V. Putin. The session was considering the issue of private land ownership, including farmland. Opinions varied among the assembled governors. Most of the regional leaders—the members of the State Council—inclined toward offering land to Russians as private property.</p><p>
"Judging from his remarks and the fact that it was he who raised the land issue in the State Council in the first place, the president, too, favored allocating land to people as private property with the right of inheritance.</p><p>
"The result of the session was that the government was instructed by May 2002 to draft new land legislation and submit it to the State Duma for consideration.</p><p>
"Of course, they were talking about the sale of land, not its gratuitous allocation for homesteads, and farmlands were not affected. Nonetheless, we can discern clear forward movement.</p><p>
"Anastasia, is this all a chain of chance incidents, or do you somehow influence people? Yes? Can you command people at a distance with your voice, too? Of course. You can, and you do. Do you speak with them?"</p><p>
"Vladimir, I have never, as you suppose, spoken at a distance with a single person besides you, and then only today, by telephone. I have never made use of the opportunity for coercion."</p><p>
"But once, when I was in Moscow, I heard your voice, Anastasia. You weren't nearby, but your voice was."</p><p>
"Vladimir, that time my grandfather was near you.</p><p>
"Many people can catch thoughts that exist in space. This is a natural ability of man. Previously all people possessed it. There's nothing wrong in this, for there is no coercion. At a distance, one person can touch another person with his thought-ray, warm him, and thereby accelerate the thought process. Each person has a thought-ray, only its power varies."</p><p>
"But your ray is very strong. Have you tried to touch people with it?"</p><p>
"Yes. But I don't name their names."</p><p>
"Why?"</p><p>
"The ray's touch is not the main thing for these people. The main thing is their ability to perceive reality."</p><p>
"All right, don't name names. Only . . . that's great! Do you know what I thought of? It's terrific! After all, you can burn people with your ray, not just warm them, at a distance. Turn even a stone to dust. You demonstrated this once. So burn up those who are planning terrorist acts. Burn the priests and all evil spirits in general. You were the one who said it. I remember, I wrote, 'With my ray I will burn up the host of age-old postulates in one instant. Do not stand between God and people,' and so on. Do you remember these words?"</p><p>
"Yes, I remember."</p><p>
"What are you waiting for then? Why don't you burn them up? You were the one who said it."</p><p>
"I was talking about postulates. I would never dare burn people up with my ray."</p><p>
"Not even the main terrorist act organizers?"</p><p>
"Not even them."</p><p>
"Why?"</p><p>
"Think for yourself about what you're saying, Vladimir."</p><p>
"What's there to think? It's clear to everyone that the terrorist act organizers and their accomplices should be destroyed immediately. Armies from various countries and special forces have been deployed for this. People are dying."</p><p>
"Their efforts are futile. They are not going to find or destroy the true organizers. They cannot avert terrorist acts this way."</p><p>
"Then all the more so. If you can figure it out and burn up in one instant both the main organizers and their accomplices, then do it. Burn them up!"</p><p>
"Vladimir, can you think some more and determine who the main organizers' accomplices are and how many of them there?"</p><p>
"Well, of course, I can think, but I'm hardly going to determine that. If you know their names, then divulge them."</p><p>
"Fine. The terrorists' accomplices include you, Vladimir, and your neighbors, and your friends, and your acquaintances."</p><p>
"What? What are you saying, Anastasia? As for myself and my friends, I know for an absolute certainty that we are not accomplices."</p><p>
"The way of life of most people, Vladimir, is the soil that cultivates terror, diseases, and other disasters. Isn't the person who works in an arms factory producing submachine guns and bullets for them an accomplice to murder?"</p><p>
"Those who produce weapons may be accomplices indirectly. But you said that about me, and I don't work in an arms factory."</p><p>
"But you smoke, Vladimir."</p><p>
"Well, yes. What does this have to do with it?"</p><p>
"Smoking is harmful. You're terrorizing your own body."</p><p>
"My own? But we were talking about something else."</p><p>
"Why speak about something else right away? Let each person analyze his way of life closely. Especially those who live in cities. Don't the people driving cars know that their car is contaminating the air with lethal gas? Don't apartment dwellers know that living in those apartments is harmful and dangerous? The big city way of life aims to destroy man, to disorient him with respect to the natural dimension. The majority of people living in this way are accomplices of terrorism."</p><p>
"Let's say that's true. However, right now many have begun to understand this and are planning to change their way of life. So help people and burn up the main organizer of terror with your ray."</p><p>
"Vladimir, to carry out your request, I would have to send through my ray a great deal of malicious energy capable of destroying a person."</p><p>
"Well, so what? Do it. After all, this person is the main organizer of terrorist acts."</p><p>
"I understand. Yet before sending malicious energy against someone else, I must concentrate and produce in myself a great quantity of that energy. Then it can settle in me anew or disperse in smaller parts. The high priest would be destroyed, but the effect of his program would continue. Evil would find another priest, and he would be more powerful than the one I destroyed. You must understand, Vladimir, terrorism, murder, and robbery are many thousands of years old. In Egypt, priests poisoned the pharaoh because he attempted to oppose their actions. When scientists uncovered his grave in the last century, they determined that Tutankhamen had only been eighteen years old. We know about the war of the priests from the Bible. You yourself must recall that the Old Testament talks about this. Before all the Hebrews went out of Egypt, the priests argued among themselves. The priest Moses asked for undivided power over the Hebrews, but the other priests did not grant his request, and then locusts attacked Egypt's crops and then first-born Egyptian children died. Many diseases beset people and livestock. Finally, the pharaoh let the Hebrews go. Frightened, Egypt's inhabitants gave them their livestock, weapons, gold, and silver.</p><p>
"The Old Testament says that God did these acts.</p><p>
"Could God act this way? Of course not. God creates a happy life for everyone. The priests committed acts of terror in Egypt when they divided power among themselves and accused God of their own evil deeds. You must also remember, Vladimir, how Jesus was crucified. Who was crucified next to him on the neighboring crosses? Robbers, so the New Testament says. And that was more than two thousand years ago. But what was the result? Today, here are more and more robberies with each passing day. Why? Living in turmoil for millennia, people never realized that evil cannot be fought with evil. Evil can only increase in that kind of struggle. This is why, Vladimir, I cannot respond to evil with malice."</p><p>
"Can't or won't. Well, all in all, it doesn't matter. Anastasia, when you speak, your arguments have weight. Indeed, humanity has been unable to fight banditry over the millennia. Perhaps it hasn't fought with the right methods. However, when you look at the present state of the world, nothing else comes to mind but how to crush the terrorists militarily. Nowadays we hear more and more often the expression 'religious extremism.' Have you heard about this?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"People also say, 'Islamic religious extremism.' It is the most powerful of all the religious extremisms, or so they say."</p><p>
"Yes, they do."</p><p>
"So what can be done? After all, the Islamic religion, I've heard, is spreading faster than all the others. Some of my acquaintances are Muslims, and they're not bad people, but on the other hand, there are also extremists among Islamists. They commit large-scale terrorist acts. How can they be fought by anything other than military force?"</p><p>
"Above all, don't lie."</p><p>
"To whom?"</p><p>
"Yourself."</p><p>
"How's that?"</p><p>
"Understand, Vladimir, you have heard about Muslims' religious extremism. Many people have been called terrorists. You are not the only who knows this, and the news has been spreading more and more throughout the world. It isn't hard to instill this thought in many people during terrorist outbreaks in which Muslims are involved. However, in speaking about Muslim terrorism, you ignore another weighty argument."</p><p>
"What?"</p><p>
"Those called extremists and terrorists believe that they are the ones trying to halt terror and that they are saving their people from attack. Their arguments are weighty as well. They believe they are saving the whole world from the spreading plague of the Western, non-Muslim world."</p><p>
"You said their arguments were weighty, but I haven't heard anything at all about them. If you know, tell me."</p><p>
"All right. But you must try to judge and then say which of the two warring sides is right. Spiritual leaders tell their Muslim congregations approximately the following: "Look, people, at what the infidels bring us. The world of the West is wallowing in depravity and fornication. It wants to infect our children with its terrible diseases. The wars of Allah must stop the onslaught of infidels."</p><p>
"Wait a minute, Anastasia. Those are just words. What are the arguments?"</p><p>
"They cite facts which show that in the countries of the West and non-Muslim countries depravity and prostitution, as well as sodomy, flourish. There are robberies. With each passing day, an increasing number of people abuse drugs. They cannot stop the terrible diseases—AIDS, for example, and alcoholism."</p><p>
"You mean the people in Muslim countries don't have any of this?"</p><p>
"Vladimir, in the Muslim world, in Muslim countries, there are many fewer drunks and smokers. There are incomparably fewer people with AIDS. Their birthrate is not falling, and compared with other countries, there are many fewer cases of adultery."</p><p>
"So it turns out that both sides are sure they're fighting for a just cause?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"What lies ahead?"</p><p>
"The priests believe that they have done everything so that a large-scale war can begin. The Western countries have united, and the Christians have moved against the Muslim world in full accord. Then the Muslim world will unite to fight, but the forces will be unequal. The Muslims do not have modern weapons. Seeing their fellow believers perish, they will begin to train thousands of terrorists in order to force the Western world to stop. War will begin, but it will be stopped and not allowed to develop."</p><p>
"By whom?"</p><p>
"Your readers. A new worldview is taking shape in them that differs from what has prevailed for the last few millennia. They are now creating in their dreams. When their dreams begin to turn into reality, all the wars and diseases will retreat."</p><p>
"You mean that this will happen when homestead construction begins? But what do homesteads have to do with stopping conflicts and religious confrontation all over the world?"</p><p>
"The good news about them will quickly spread throughout the world. The people of the whole Earth will begin to see clearly after their hypnotic captivity and wake up from their thousand-year sleep. They will change their way of life and build with inspiration a Divine world all over the Earth."</p><p>
"Of course, if this does begin to happen everywhere, the world really will change. I know you dream of this, Anastasia. You believe in your dream and would never betray it. Many have understood your homestead idea. These people really are beginning to act. But you don't know everything, Anastasia. Let's go to my apartment, my office. I'm going to show you one thing right now, and you will see for yourself what these people face."</p><p>
"Let's go, Vladimir, and you will show me what has troubled you so."</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Who Is For, Who Is Against?</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>When we entered my apartment, Anastasia removed her warm vest and scarf, and her golden hair spilled over her shoulders. She gave her head a light shake, and the apartment filled with the marvelous fragrances of the taiga.</p><p>
I took a chair, placed it next to my armchair by the desk in my office, and turned on my computer to go on the Internet.</p><p>
Not everyone in Russia knows what the Internet is, so I will briefly explain. The Internet is an information network that has been intensively developed in many countries of the world. Using a computer, you can go onto this network and through a telephone line connect with a server, a special powerful computer that contains a great deal of information of every possible kind. You can post your own announcements on most servers.</p><p>
The Anastasia Foundation for Culture and Creative Support of the City of Vladimir together with Russian Express, a Moscow firm, has also created its own server and its own website, Anastasia.ru.</p><p>
In this way, a reader with access to a computer can type this address on a keyboard and get to our website, express his opinion about what he's read by sending a typed message, learn the opinion of other readers, and debate or discuss a question.</p><p>
Those who don't have their own computer can do the same thing by going to one of the Internet clubs that now function in all Russian provincial and district centers, as well as probably in most Russian cities.</p><p>
From time to time, I have also gone on the Internet and familiarized myself with readers' statements. I could not do this often, since I could not keep up with the correspondence that came to my address personally by mail. But more than fourteen thousand messages have been posted at Anastasia.ru in the last year. People have discussed specific issues concerning Anastasia's ideas about homesteads. They have suggested draft amendments for the Constitution and intend to hold a referendum on this issue.</p><p>
The essence of Anastasia's idea about allocating at least one hectare of land to set up a homestead to each family that wants it has been set forth in appeals to the president in more detail and with more arguments than I did in my book, Who Are We? Actually, judge for yourself. For those readers who have no Internet access, I will excerpt one message.</p><p>
</p><p>Open Letter to President of the Russian Federation</p><p>Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin</p><p>Esteemed Vladimir Vladimirovich!</p><p>
In the years of Soviet power, which many today still remember as the best years of their life, perhaps the worst possible thing occurred. We, the citizens of a Great Country, Russia, a historically mighty Power, which emerged the victor from the horrors of World War II and was able in a fantastically short period of time to restore its war-ravaged economy, were transformed, unbeknownst to ourselves, into spineless parasites and spongers.</p><p>
We all went to work without any concern about there being a job opening, and we were paid a stable salary on which we could live decently. We gave our children over to be educated and were sure of their future. We knew that when we reached pension age, we would be paid a stable pension, based on our achievements, and would spend a peaceful old age. And this stability, this mighty totalitarian system, played a nasty joke on us. Now, having grown accustomed to social passivity and social apathy, to indifference, while not getting the same stable material foundation for life anymore, we became indignant. We did not begin to act and improve our lives. We just began railing and cursing each succeeding president and government for all we were worth, holding them, and only them, to blame for our present. After all, we believe that the state owes us a stable salary and concern about our present and future. We are simply going to get the most of life without doing anything to support our Stability and Well-being. You will agree that when there is only movement in this one direction, we become parasites, since we want to receive without giving anything in return.</p><p>
Then something AMAZING happened. Thousands and tens of thousands of Russians were stirred by an impulse to CREATE!</p><p>
CREATE a beautiful, blooming corner of their Homeland, RUSSIA;</p><p>
CREATE a beautiful Present and Future for themselves and their children;</p><p>
CREATE their own Material and Spiritual Well-Being;</p><p>
CREATE a Russia that is the richest and most prosperous country!</p><p>
And all these people need for this is a small plot of land measuring one hectare, and confidence that no one will later take away this land, their Homeland, where they are going to Create for the ages a dimension of Love for themselves and their children. This DIMENSION OF LOVE will flow from all the blooming corners of vast Russia and herald to the Whole World about the Great Miracle: the Rebirth of Great Russia!</p><p>
I think that right now a situation has come about in Russia such that any Ruler—call him President—of a country could only dream of, a situation when the people themselves want to work and to create for themselves their own material and spiritual well-being, without asking anything of the state beyond a plot of land and a measure of stable ownership reflected in Law.</p><p>
Isn't this the dream of any state, to discover an INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE of wealth and well-being inside itself and to acquire STABILITY in itself and independence from outside troubles?</p><p>
Vladimir Vladimirovich, I, like thousands of Russia's citizens, confirm yet again my intention to CREATE my own small corner of my Homeland, Russia, and make it a blooming garden for many generations of my descendants.</p><p>
Like thousands of Russian citizens, I confirm yet again my intention to labor for the good of my family and of my Homeland.</p><p>
Like thousands of citizens of Russia, I have stopped criticizing without thought or restraint both you and our Government, since I realize the complexity and responsibility of your work.</p><p>
Like thousands of citizens of Russia, I believe in your wisdom and farsightedness, in the fact that you are assessing the current situation in a fully responsible manner.</p><p>
The time has come at last for all of us to form one amiable collective with you, a collective of like-minded people, and when we UNDERSTAND and ACCEPT you as a close friend, you will feel our love and support and will take care of us with love as the Nation entrusted to you.</p><p>
TOGETHER WE WILL CREATE A PRESENT AND A BEAUTIFUL FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR RUSSIA!</p><p>
Vadim Ponomarev, citizen of Russia</p><p>20 July 2001</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>They Slandered Our Forefathers in the Same Way</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>One day I ran a search-engine program that finds a number of Internet sites based on key words. I typed in "Anastasia," and a very large number appeared on my monitor: 246 Russian-language servers and their addresses. Still not believing that they all concerned the Siberian Anastasia, I began to type these addresses one after the other and to familiarize myself with their content. The overwhelming majority concerned to some extent the Siberian Anastasia. I found that many servers received her positively. At first, this fact pleased me greatly, but as I read more deeply on the Internet, I began to come across an even more incredible fact. Many sites posted a selection of newspaper articles and anonymous messages claiming that the movement connected with Anastasia was a sect and that all the book's readers were sectarians. One site laconically cited a list of all or most of the existing sects in Russia, and "Anastasia" and those who support her were included among them. It did not provide a basis for this or say who spread these rumors, but presented it as a given, a fact well known to everyone.</p><p>
The articles and short items from various central and regional publications posted on separate sites greatly resembled one another and always drew the same conclusion: the Ringing Cedars of Russia movement was a sect or a business, comparable to Aum Shinrikyo. They called our readers a totalitarian sect, using words like "obscurantism" and "destructivism." No concrete facts were cited, just the conclusion.</p><p>
Without knowing the precise definition of the word "totalitarianism," I opened the Great Encyclopedic Dictionary and read in it the following: "Totalitarianism is a form of statehood characterized by its total control over all spheres of life of a society, the de facto elimination of constitutional rights and freedoms, and repression against opposition and dissidents (for example, the various forms of totalitarianism in fascist Germany and Italy and the Communist regime in the Soviet Union)."</p><p>
Strong stuff. So apparently either I or Anastasia were leading a totalitarian sect prepared to overthrow the state, abolish constitutional freedoms, and establish a fascist regime. Yet I don't head any organization whatsoever, and Anastasia certainly doesn't. For the entire last six years I've been working on nothing but my books, once or twice a year speaking to readers' conferences open to the public. My speeches have been recorded, and anyone who wants to can listen to them.</p><p>
But why, to what end, and by whom is this out-and-out lie being circulated? For example, one newspaper article in the Vladimir supplement to Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that Anastasia's books tell people to abandon their apartments and go into the forests.</p><p>
"How can that be?" I thought. After all, Anastasia says the exact opposite. Here are her exact words: "You shouldn't go to the forests. First, clean up the garbage you've left." She calls on people to build their homesteads next to cities, gradually changing their way of life to a more civilized one that benefits their physical and spiritual health.</p><p>
Without the opportunity to familiarize myself with the huge volume of information, let alone analyze it, I've turned to several well-known political scientists for their help and asked them, independently of each other, to analyze the situation and draw their own conclusions. They asked quite a substantial payment for the job, since each had to read all five books, as well as the extensive information connected with the books that is on the Internet. I had to agree.</p><p>
Three months later, I received the early conclusions from one specialist, and a little while later from the others. While expressing their conclusions in different words, independently of each other, since they did not know one another, they gave approximately identical conclusions. I will cite here excerpts from one of them, typical of the rest:</p><p>
"A single-minded, vividly expressed campaign is being conducted against the ideas set forth in the series of books entitled Ringing Cedars of Russia for the purpose of preventing their spread in society. . . .</p><p>
"The pivotal ideas of the books are the strengthening of the state and the achievement of the greatest possible consensus in various strata of society through the flourishing of each individual family. Well-being is achieved by allocating at least one hectare of land for life-time use to each family that desires it. In the context of the books, this idea sounds quite convincing and dominates all the others. Consequently, its opponents, whatever arguments they cite, are in fact speaking out against this idea specifically.</p><p>
"The next issue touched upon by the Ringing Cedars of Russia series, man's Divine essence, his spiritual principle, could provoke rejection by many religious confessions. The book's heroine asserts that man must build by himself his own earthly paradise. Man is eternal. From age to age, he changes only his flesh. All the nature around us has been created by God and is His living thought. Only by coming into contact with nature can man understand God's program, the essence of his own purpose on Earth. . . .</p><p>
"This concept, so well argued and convincing, cannot help but evoke rejection, especially among religious fanatics who consider the end of the world and the winning of heaven or hell for each soul inevitable. This concept benefits many people incapable of building a happy life for themselves under earthly conditions.</p><p>
"Opposition to Anastasia, the main heroine of the Ringing Cedars of Russia series, is carried out by spreading rumors in the media about the readers who have expressed initiative to implement the plans in the book—that these readers belong to some totalitarian sect.</p><p>
"This course was not initiated randomly, since it can distance the state from contact with enterprising readers, from considering their concrete suggestions, and from discussing in the media the problems raised in the books, thus preventing the spread of the books and their ideas. It should be noted that the opposing side has achieved its goal. According to current information, the charge that such readers belong to a sect has spread through many administrative agencies.</p><p>
"The purposes of the opposition are unclear and quite puzzling.</p><p>
"As a rule, the client initiating such dirty tricks is easily determined in a political campaign. In the economic sphere, which is conditioned by competitive struggle among individual firms, it is also not difficult to determine the client behind any discreditation. The goal, too, is always clear: to eliminate or weaken a competitor.</p><p>
"Anastasia talks about man's new consciousness, a new way of life, and changes in the structure of the state to rest on a more perfect foundation.</p><p>
"Who could oppose this aspiration? Only forces with an interest in the ruinous condition of individual families, the state, and society as a whole. The fact of the existence of such forces can be traced through their vividly expressed opposition, which consists in this case in the campaign against Anastasia, her ideas, and the readers of the Ringing Cedars of Russia books. Evidently, they are acting through structures and individual persons either directly or indirectly subordinate to them."</p><p>
I showed Anastasia individual fragments from discussions of the topic on Internet sites and read her the specialist's conclusion so that it would affect her, so that the current situation would agitate her, and so that that she would begin to correct it somehow.</p><p>
But Anastasia sat calmly beside me on a chair, her hands in her lap, and her face expressed no agitation. On the contrary, she was even smiling faintly.</p><p>
"Why are you smiling, Anastasia?" I asked. "You're not at all upset at how they are slandering your readers? At how they are blocking their initiatives for obtaining homestead land?"</p><p>
"I am gladdened, Vladimir, by the inspired surge of many people, by their understanding of the essence and significance of the upcoming accomplishments. Look at how consciously they set forth their thoughts and make plans for the future. They formulated a better appeal to the President than you did in your book, and they are planning to hold a conference with a good title: 'Choose Your Own Future!' It is very good when people start giving serious thought to the future."</p><p>
"Sure, they're planning that. But can't you see how they're being opposed? Such a clever move has been conceived. They've called everyone sectarians and thereby frightened the public and distanced administrative agencies. Do you really not notice this?"</p><p>
"I do. But there is nothing cunning or new in this opposition. This is precisely the way in which the culture of our forefathers' way of life and knowledge was destroyed. Right now as well the dark forces act through their old methods. Furthermore, they will also think up other provocations themselves and then will spread frightening rumors. This has happened before, Vladimir."</p><p>
"That's it exactly. It has, and they won. You yourself say that they destroyed the culture of our forefathers. They distorted history. That means now, too, acting by a tested method, they will win. If they haven't already. Great! It's been a year and we still haven't been able to resolve such a very simple matter as allocating a hectare of land to each family that wants it. It would be one thing if we were to ask for this hectare to do something unnecessary. It is impossible to obtain land to set up your own homestead for decent living conditions and food. Refugees have been living there in tent cities for more than three years. If whoever wants it would just be given a hectare of land each, in three years they could have already set things up in a human way. I've thought a lot, Anastasia, about what tremendous changes could come about in our country, if there were not opposition but rather help for people trying to create their own homesteads. But this very simple matter of allocating land cannot seem to be resolved."</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Good News</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>"This matter is very far from very simple, Vladimir, because it will entail global changes both on our planet and in the Universe. When millions of happy earthly families begin to consciously transform the planet into a blooming garden, the harmony that comes to reign on Earth will exert its influence both on other planets and on the universal dimension. Right now, smoking stench is emanating from the earthly planet into the Cosmos, and the litter in the Earth's orbit has continued to increase. Malicious energy is emanating from the Earth. Another energy will emanate when Earthlings' consciousness changes, and the grace coming from the Earth will foster blooming gardens on other planets."</p><p>
"Wonderful! So grandiose! But hasn't there been an opportunity like this in the history of humanity before? After all, before the Revolution, Russian landowners had their own homesteads. Even right now, private land ownership exists in many countries. We have farmers, too, allowed to lease land for extended periods, but nothing good has come of this. Why?"</p><p>
"There wasn't the kind of consciousness that is now growing in human hearts and minds like Divine shoots. What you called a simple matter, Vladimir, is in fact the greatest secret, guarded by the priests during the occult millennia. Many religions of all times have spoken of God, but none of them talks about the obvious. By consciously communicating with nature, man is communicating with Divine thought. Understanding the dimension means understand God. Even the thought, the dream of a homestead, where everything is in harmony with you, shows more closeness with God than the many intricate rituals. All the universe's secrets will be revealed to man. Man will suddenly discover abilities in himself of which he has no notion even today. He, that man who begins to create a Divine world around himself, will truly come to resemble God.</p><p>
"Think, why do the sages not mention this anywhere? Because man, once he understands his earthly essence and his opportunities, will become free of occult sorcery. The priests' power will disappear. No one and nothing will be able to rule over a man who has created a dimension of Love around himself. For that man, the Creator will be not an ominous and stern judge but a father and friend. This is why so many subterfuges have been created over the centuries in order to lead man away from his main purpose. Land! Such a simple matter, you say, Vladimir. But you must think why centuries have passed without man possessing his own native land. You just mentioned farmers and landowners. But after all, although they have their own native land, they used, and in many cases forced, other people to work on it. They tried to extract as much profit as possible from their land. Those who worked someone else's land could not treat it with love. They often threw the seeds into the ground with malice, and their malice grew. Simple truths were hidden from people for millennia. Strangers' hands and thoughts should not touch native land by coercive means. Rulers of various times have given people plots of land, but without making the land's true purpose clear to people.</p><p>
"If you give someone a little bit of land—for example, a quarter of a hectare—a family cannot create on it an oasis that will serve them effortlessly. On the other hand, man cannot take care of a larger area independently and needs to invite helpers, thus bringing in strangers' thoughts. In this way, through cunning and subterfuges, people have been consistently led away from the land's main purpose."</p><p>
"So no religion in thousands of years has called on people to create Divine oases on their own land, but have, on the contrary, been constantly calling people away from the land? That means they . . ."</p><p>
"Vladimir, you must not say anything unflattering about religions. Your spiritual father, the monk Feodorit, brought you to the present day. Indeed, you and I once met largely thanks to him. Today the day has come when the entire flock of the different confessions must think about how to save our spiritual leaders from disaster."</p><p>
"What disaster?"</p><p>
"The kind that came about in the last century, when people attacked temples and sent the servants of different faiths to their death."</p><p>
"You mean, under Soviet power. Yet right now there is democracy, after all, with freedom of religion, and the authorities allow everything—at least the main religions. Why should past disasters suddenly be repeated?"</p><p>
"You must take a closer look at present-day events, Vladimir. You know that many countries have united in the fight against terrorism."</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"They have determined the other countries to blame for terrorism and named those behind it. Among others, they have accused spiritual, religious leaders. Special forces have been set on a hunt for them, but that is just the beginning. Already more than one report to the rulers of countries great and small has revealed the essence of many religions. The reports cite numerous examples about how they—religions—have created wars and terror. Analysts have set everything out precisely and convincingly. In the future they will gradually make public the facts of many evil deeds and remind people about the endless string of crusades, intrigues, perversions, and greed among occult servants. When the indignation has mounted in many people, widespread pogroms and the destruction of temples could start occurring. Right now, the servants of many religions are trying to halt religious extremism and they are making statements about how they have nothing to do with extremists and openly condemn extremism. For now, their statements have been accepted. Or rather, rulers pretend not to understand . . . and the statements satisfy them. Meanwhile, secret reports already contend that religions are programming people, whether for good and ill—it doesn't matter. The pretexts could be good and call on people to create good. But belief in something man cannot see and at the same time compliantly accepts as truth from a preacher is always fraught with the possibility to redirect the programmed believer. The preacher is free to turn believers into suicide bombers. The report cites many different proofs from past and present to support its finding. Rulers will consequently be inclined to choose one religion, take it under their total control, and deeming all the others destructive, eradicate them. Consequently, if one religion does not gain universal acceptance, they will have to destroy all the religions at least in their own countries. This kind of decision will lead to continuous war. Such a war has actually had its basis laid already and is under way. It must be stopped. This can be done by only one means, by inculcating awareness in spiritual leaders. Only the good news can restore peace all over the Earth. Those who accept the good news will proclaim it in temples large and small, and the temples will be filled with multitudes. Those who do not accept it will find themselves in deserted, collapsing temples."</p><p>
"What news do you have in mind, Anastasia? You have to tell me more simply somehow."</p><p>
"Those who call themselves spiritual leaders today and who talk about God and teach children in contemporary schools must recognize a family's creation of a dimension of Love on their own homestead as a godly deed. In the temples, they and their parishioners must recognize and create plans for future settlements. Together, they must strive to return the knowledge of the primary sources, to dream, to discuss, and to improve the plan in detail. The process of dreaming the creation will take more than a year. Later, when everything comes to pass, people will live in harmony, in a real and Divine dimension."</p><p>
"Anastasia, I see. You want people to study nature in every temple of every different religious orientation, in schools, and in institutions of higher education, so that people grasp the science of creating a homestead according to a special plan. Let's suppose this really can unite different religious confessions in deed and not just in words.</p><p>
"Let's suppose this will really rouse people from their hypnotic sleep and put an end to terrorism, drug use, and many other negative social processes.</p><p>
"Let's suppose that. Nevertheless, how do you convince all the patriarchs and clergy of every different spiritual confession? How do you convince all the secular educational institutions? You have accomplished a lot, Anastasia, but what you're talking about right now is unrealistic."</p><p>
"It's realistic. There is no other way for them."</p><p>
"But you're the one who thinks that. Only you. These are only your simple words."</p><p>
"But He who allows me to speak these simple words, as you say, Vladimir, possesses unsurpassed power. You must remember, more than seven years ago, when you were still an entrepreneur, I drew letters in the sand with a stick by a taiga lake for you."</p><p>
"Yes, I remember. So?"</p><p>
"Suddenly you began to write books, which many people have already read. What do you think? Who gets the credit for this? The sand by the taiga lake, the stick I drew with, the words I uttered, or your hand itself which created all the books? Then poetry began to spout from a holy spring in human hearts. Who created all this activity primarily?"</p><p>
"I don't know. Maybe all the factors here had an effect."</p><p>
"Believe me, Vladimir, please, believe me. His energy infused everything that was created. His energy inspired human hearts and will continue to inspire them."</p><p>
"Possibly. But it's hard to believe that the clergy will begin to act as you say."</p><p>
"You have to believe in this and model the happy situation inside you, and then it will come to pass, especially since this is not hard for you to do now. You must remember: an Orthodox priest came to see you from his village church in order to help you keep up your fallen spirit. Another priest bought your books with his own money and passed them out in prisons. And your Father Feodorit spoke to you about many things. Do you remember?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"You must also understand that all church servants are not alike in their worldview. Some will be found who will carry the good news."</p><p>
"Yes, I think they will. But there will be others, too, who will start to resist. In addition, the high priest you talked about and his occult helpers will come up with some other chicanery."</p><p>
"They will, of course, but all attempts by the dark forces will now be in vain. The process now begun is irrevocable. People are coming to know an earthly paradise. Simple words you say. I will pronounce them. Look, I will now say two simple words, and some of the darkness will be flooded with light. Let the others who remain tremble, concealing their names, as they lose their opportunity to be made real. The words are quite simple: FAMILY BOOK.</p><p>
</p><p>

</br></div>`
</p><p>
"Indeed, the words are very simple. I don't understand why all the forces of darkness must tremble at them."</p><p>
"They fear what is behind these words. Do you know who will write this book and how many pages it will have?"</p><p>
"How many pages? And who will write them?"</p><p>
"In not very many days, millions of fathers and mothers at different ends of the Earth will create a Family Book. They will fill the pages with their own hand. There will be a great many family books. Each will express a truth that comes from the heart, for their children. There will be no room in these books for slyness. Historical falsehood will fall before them.</p><p>
"Imagine what would happen, Vladimir, if you could pick up a book today that your distant ancestor had begun writing for you personally. Another continued it, then your grandfather, then your father and mother.</p><p>
"People read many books today which have been written with a specific purpose: to distort history, the essence of life. Many false postulates purposely disorient man. One cannot sort this out immediately. Clarity sets in, however, when a son reads the book of his forefathers that was continued by his father and mother personally for him."</p><p>
"But wait, Anastasia. Not every person knows how to write books."</p><p>
"Everyone can if he senses the need. If he wants to safeguard his children and himself in the future from false postulates. In Vedian times, each father and mother wrote a family book for their future children and grandchildren. That book consisted of deeds rather than words. Children could read the dimension that had been created as they would a book and understand the deeds and intentions of their parents, and they were happy to inherit a joyful dimension. The only things that book lacked were warnings to the children about the occult world.</p><p>
"The all-knowing sorcerers did not know about it. Now, when nearly all humanity has come to know for itself the ruinous manifestations of occult postulates, they can protect their children from them.</p><p>
"Even if there aren't any homesteads yet blooming in spring, intentions about them are already living in many human hearts. They need to begin to write a book about their intentions for their children."</p><p>
"But why should each parent write? For instance, I write books about homesteads, an architect from Medvedkovo is working on a plan for an entire settlement, and this topic is stormily discussed on the Internet. Isn't this enough?"</p><p>
"No, it isn't, Vladimir. You must look more closely at the present situation. You are writing books, but others are also writing to offset yours. There are so many books that one person alone could not read half of them in a lifetime. After all, information not from books streams at man daily. It seems varied, but it really speaks of just one thing: it justifies and glorifies the occult, unreal world. What can help the person newly arrived in the world sort out the truth from the lie? The family's main sacred object—the Family Book—will help. The father and mother will write to their son and daughter about creating the necessary conditions for happiness. The children will continue the Family Book. There will be no book wiser or more truthful for each family in the whole Earth. All the knowledge of the primary sources will fill it."</p><p>
"Anastasia, how can the knowledge of the primary sources end up in a book that present-day people begin to write? Where are they going to get that knowledge? You did say that the culture of our ancestors and their books were all destroyed."</p><p>
"Those who begin writing have the knowledge inside. It is kept inside each person. When people think about this and start writing not just for anyone but specifically for their children, all the knowledge of the primary sources will become clear in them in a conscious way."</p><p>
"Does this means that before writing, you need to think, so that wise thoughts are set down in the book from the first pages right away?"</p><p>
"The first pages may be outwardly simple."</p><p>
"Like what, for example?"</p><p>
"When was the person who began writing the Family Book born? What was his name? Why, with what thoughts, did he begin to apply pen to the pages of the main book, and what did he intend to create in the future?"</p><p>
"A book like that is easy to write for someone like a famous artist, for example, or a governor, or a scholar, or a successful entrepreneur. But what about those who simply lived? Say a man works, barely making ends meet, for example, to earn enough for his bread and clothing. What advice can he write to his children? What kind of advice can he give?"</p><p>
"The rulers of the present day, those who sparkle before people in the rays of fame, and those who have earned a lot of money will have a harder time in the future answering to their children. People quickly forget external deeds. But future generations will value what a person has contributed to the future. Do you or does anyone else really often think about past governors, famous artists, or entrepreneurs?"</p><p>
"Not often. Rather, I don't think about them at all. I don't even know their names. But their children will remember their parents' deeds with pride."</p><p>
"And their children will try to forget, ashamed at mentions of their parents' name."</p><p>
"But why should the children be ashamed?"</p><p>
"Fate presented their parents with great opportunities, but they never did understand that opportunities are always given in order to create the future. A person should try in his one life to build a second life. Then he will be reincarnated and will live eternally.</p><p>
"Each person can think about a homestead and a dimension of Love today. He can create his plan and try to get the land. He can cultivate a few tree saplings, or perhaps he plants family trees on that land, even if he can't grow a forest, a green fence, or a beautiful orchard. A poor old man might not even be able to lay the foundation of a house. But he will be able to write a Family Book for his children and his grandchildren: 'I was poor, and only when I got to old age did I start thinking about the meaning of life and what I had given my children. I created a plan for our family's dimension. It is for you, my children, that I have described it in my book. I myself was only able to plant nine fruit trees in the orchard and one tree where the woods should be.'</p><p>
"The years will pass. A grandson will read this book and remember his grandfather. He will go up to a mighty, magnificent cedar or oak growing among many other trees on the land of his homestead.</p><p>
"The grandson's thought, full of love and gratitude, will fly up into the dimension and merge with his grandfather's thought, and then a new plan of existence will be born for the two. Man has been presented with eternal life in full. Mastery of the Earth and the universal planets is nothing but each person's transformation of himself.</p><p>
"The Family Book will help convey the good news to his descendents and will help the soul who began writing it to be reincarnated on Earth."</p><p>
"Anastasia, you are ascribing such great importance to this book that I, too, feel like starting to write it for my descendants. I feel intuitively that your idea about the book conceals something grand and unusual. What does it matter what it's called—'Family Book,' 'Book of Family,' 'The Holiest Book for the Family'? But what can it be written on? Ordinary paper deteriorates and rots so quickly, and the binding of notebooks and scrapbooks always looks primitive. After all, if the book is intended for descendants and if, as you say, this book has great significance, then the paper and binding should be appropriate. What do you think? What should they be?"</p><p>
"Like this, for example"—and she glanced at a book lying on my desk. I followed her gaze and an instant later was holding something unusual. . . .</p><p>
"A while ago, Sergei from Novosibirsk sent me my book, Anastasia. The ordinary publisher's binding had been cut off and the pages placed into another . . . I want to say 'binding,' but what held the pages can no longer be called such."</p><p>
A Siberian artist had created an unusual work of art. The cover, including the spine, had been made of precious woods—beech along the edges and cedar inside. All the details had been decorated in exquisite carving: ornament, text, and illustrations. All this was hard to call by the ordinary word "cover." A more precise word would probably be "setting." The top and bottom parts were attached to the spine, but on the other side, there was a small lock. All the details fit together very precisely. With the book closed, the paper pages were compressed perfectly evenly by the top and bottom parts of the setting, which would not let the paper warp at elevated or lowered humidity. They didn't even become deformed in a draft, unlike other books that I set next to it for comparison. Many who saw this work held it for a long time, examining and admiring it.</p><p>
Following Anastasia's gaze, I picked up the book in the wooden setting, felt its warmth, and understood. I understood, perhaps with the help of this unusual work, the unprecedented significance of the Family Book Anastasia had spoken of.</p><p>
She was sitting modestly on a chair next to me, her hands humbly folded in her lap. But I got the feeling that she was wiser than all the priests who had led their dynasties since remote antiquity and wiser than modern analysts. Her wisdom and purity of intention made her capable of vanquishing all the negative manifestations in the human community. Where did these abilities in her come from? What school, what system of upbringing could give man its like?</p><p>
How amazing to come up with this nonstandard, incredible move of the Family Book! I couldn't help it and quickly began to contemplate it and . . . Judge for yourself what she had thought up.</p><p>
No one could withstand the flow of all the different suggestions raining down every minute on people—primarily on our children—in the different countries.</p><p>
Suggestions! Action movies air constantly on television, supposedly to entertain the audience, but in fact showing how one can ensure one's well-being through violence.</p><p>
Suggestions! How terrific to be a famous singer, to sparkle in a sea of lights and applause, to go to parties in magnificent cars. A suggestion! Along with this, it is essential to show other, significantly more extensive intervals from the life of these people: the very hard daily labor, the continual intrigue among show business rivals, all the different incessant attacks by those jealous of others' success and greedy for the money to be made off a famous individual through the so-called free press.</p><p>
Another monstrous suggestion is aggressive, cunning advertising, which is prepared to advertise anything at all, for money.</p><p>
A suggestion! Continuous news about all kinds of international philanthropic foundations and super-politicians creates the impression in people that they owe to these elites their heat, comfort, and food on the table in their homes. When the radiators go cold in a building, people no longer try to think about how to change their life and become independent of central heating, water, and electricity. People go out in the streets like madmen with the slogan, "Give!" A suggestion of one's own helplessness! False postulates are being suggested to adults and children alike.</p><p>
Children! What sort of childrearing can we talk about at all, if we parents have little to do with it, if we allow someone in some institution to raise our children or teach them in school? We also allow shops to lay out before our children overt and covert pornographic literature.</p><p>
We allow someone to recommend books and textbooks to our children. We allow unknown people to shape television programs for them. Who? Who benefits from holding our children's entire upbringing in their hands? Maybe it doesn't matter who. Maybe what does matter is that we feel our complete helplessness and insignificance. That we feel the impossibility of stopping the bacchanalia. But that isn't true! Each parent can do that, If he wants to. If he thinks about it. The Family Book! So well conceived! The end to the bacchanalia of mercantile suggestion. Let this bacchanalia get a little more practice and demonstrate itself. However, man will soon take into his hands his Family Book, and there, written in the hand of his grandfather, grandmother, father, and mother, is man's purpose. We, today's parents, absolutely must sort out where that purpose lies. We must! We are experienced, and we have seen, heard, and tried out much ourselves. All we have to do is stop for a moment, turn away from the flow of suggestions, and think for ourselves, with our own mind. Each parent absolutely must think hard. For himself! And himself alone. It is useless to look for answers to questions about the meaning of life in the wisest books of centuries past, no matter how much these books have been praised or propagandized. It is useless to look for answers in the works of sages recognized for millennia.</p><p>
They—the sages—were great preachers and messiahs. They tried to preach to and write for future generations, but not one, not a single one of these great works will we ever see. They have been masterfully destroyed. This is easy to understand if you stop and think.</p><p>
Judge for yourself. By moving just one comma in a short sentence you can alter the meaning of what was said. Remember the famous example: "Punish you mustn't, show mercy!" "Punish, you mustn't show mercy!" How many similar alterations were made in the works of ancient thinkers—intentionally and unintentionally—by scribes, translators, publishers, and historians? We are talking not only about moving punctuation marks, but about the deletion of chapters and pages and the writing of commentaries of their own. As a result, we are living in an illusory world. Humanity has waged war without end. People have frenziedly destroyed one another and cannot understand why wars do not end. How can they end if humanity has never once been able to determine the instigator of war? It hasn't because, not thinking independently, men have mistaken suggestion for truth.</p><p>
Who started World War II? Who fought whom? Who won the victory? According to the entire world community, Hitler's Germany started the war, and victory was won by the Soviet Union led by Stalin. This half-truth, or rather raving, is perceived by the majority as absolute, historical fact, clear to all.</p><p>
Only a few research historians sometimes mention Hitler's spiritual advisors—for example, the Russian lama Gurdjieff, who acted through Karl Haushofer and Dietrich Eckart. Historians also know about contacts between the spiritual advisors and those standing above them in the upper hierarchy. Here no one will name names. Researchers say merely that the trail leads to the Himalayas and Tibet and to the secret and open occult societies that existed in Germany and to which Hitler belonged.</p><p>
Organizations were formed in Germany, the German Order and the Thule society, the symbol of the latter being the swastika with a wreath and sword.</p><p>
Someone obviously and purposely shaped a unique, previously unknown ideology in Germany. A specific worldview type was inculcated in people. The result was large-scale war, millions of victims, and the International Nuremberg trials, where Hitler's comrades-in-arms were tried. But only soldiers appeared in court. Even if they held the rank of general or field marshal, they were still soldiers, including Hitler. They were soldiers of the invisible priest who shaped their ideology. However, this main strategist and organizer was not even mentioned in the court transcripts. Who was he? Who were his closest secret champions and assistants? Is it so important to have a notion of them? Yes! It is incredibly important. After all, it is they who started the war, and remaining in the shadow, they will start another again. With their experience, the new wars will be more sophisticated and larger in scale.</p><p>
What did they in fact intend by starting World War II? Perhaps an understanding of the following fact might bring us closer to an answer.</p><p>
For the ideologists of Nazism who existed at that time in Germany, the Ahnenerbe organization collected ancient books from all over the world. Above all, they were interested in ancient Russian editions of the pre-Christian period. A strange chain can be traced: the Himalayas, Tibet, lamas, secret societies, and as a result, the intensified hunt for the knowledge of our ancestors from pagan Rus'. We hadn't needed these manuscripts, but they were vitally essential to someone. Why? What secrets did this knowledge contain, obviously mightier than everything the Tibetan monks know? But how can one touch even one of these secrets? Just one! And if it turns out to be significant, then what lost world might open up before today's people if a few more or all of them are disseminated? Where, in what millennia, is the answer to be sought? Rome! Ancient Rome! Something unusual—stranger than the conquests of the Roman legions—happened there four thousand years ago. That's it! Here it is! Something incredible! The Roman senators, the elite of the era, who had slaves, suddenly began giving land to those of their slaves who knew how and wanted to grow food. They started giving them land . . . for lifetime use and the right to hand it down by inheritance. The slave's family was allocated funds for building a house. The slave's family could not be handed over to another owner without his land. The land was an inalienable part of the slave's family.</p><p>
What prompted the slave owners to such a humane and altruistic act? Did they do so out of noble impulses? Or did they get something in return? They did receive ten percent of the harvest for their table. This was probably the smallest tax ever known. The question arises as to why the Roman elite agreed to such a thing. After all, a slave owner could force his slaves to work in the fields by the sweat of their brow and could take as much as he had a mind to take. But no! Why? Because pagan Rome still retained Vedian knowledge, and the patricians and senators knew that the same food grown by someone who wasn't free on land that wasn't his own was drastically different from what he grew on his own land with love.</p><p>
At that time, people still knew that everything that grows in the earth bears a psychic energy. To be healthy, you have to eat good fruits for food. Several very ancient books in the Alexandrian library mentioned this, but the library was destroyed. What other knowledge was concealed along with these books? Anastasia says that every person can resurrect in himself all knowledge and wisdom, beginning from the primary sources. Anyone can do this. One wants to believe this assertion, but it's hard to believe completely. Where is the proof that this is possible? What facts can we extract from our memory in order to believe her entirely?</p><p>
Should we remember everything that we heard from our father and mother, that was taught to us in school, and that we have read over our lifetime? But we find no weighty, absolute proofs in our recollections. Recall everything my spiritual father Feodorit said? But he didn't say much. Mostly he listened and gave me old books to read, but even those did not have proofs. How then? How can modern man suddenly discover in himself this precious knowledge of the primary sources? He can! The memories of each person likely still hold characteristic examples and proofs. In my own memories I found one.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Good and Attentive Grandmother</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>My grandmother! My grandmother was a witch. Not a fairytale witch, but a real, genuine, white witch. Old-timers may remember her incredible miracles. She lived in Ukraine, in the village of Kuznichi, Gorodnyansky District, Chernigovskaya Province. Her first name was Yefrosinia; her last, Verkhusha. One day, when I was a small child, I was present at her miracle-working.</p><p>
At the time, I understood little of this, but now absolutely all of it has become clear. Lord, what simplicity in the most enigmatic incredibility! I think half the people today, especially healers, would be able to achieve her results easily. Here is a little more detail about what happened.</p><p>
I spent my early childhood in the Ukrainian countryside, in a little white cottage with a thatched roof. I liked to watch my grandmother bustling by the stove. One day, during a quarrel, one of my playmates threw out this insult: "And your grandmother's a witch." The others started defending my grandmother immediately: "My mama says she's good."</p><p>
More than once I saw my grandmother heal people. I didn't think it particularly important. In those days, there were many healers in the villages. One might be better at healing one disease, another a different disease, and no one called anyone witches. But my grandmother's abilities went beyond the ordinary bounds of healing. My barely literate grandmother easily treated many animals. She did this in an outwardly incredible way. She would disappear for twenty-four hours with the sick animal and then return with it either healed or responding to treatment, and she would tell the owner how to proceed after that.</p><p>
When I heard my playmate's insult against my grandmother, my feelings about my good grandmother didn't change in the least, though children are afraid of all kinds of witches; she, or rather her actions, merely piqued my interest.</p><p>
One day, they brought the collective farm chairman's horse, a thoroughbred recently purchased so that the chairman could go about his official duties, to my grandmother. We, the local children, had always admired the horse when the chairman rode by. It held its head high and had a much more dashing and beautiful gait than all the other village horses. This time, however, it was brought to my grandmother unsaddled and unharnessed in a cart. It was led, now downcast and moving slowly, by a simple bridle. For me it was an unprecedented event, the chairman's horse in our yard, and I began following with interest what was happening.</p><p>
My grandmother walked up to the horse, began stroking its side and face, and whispered something kind into its ear. Then my grandmother removed the bridle (she pulled the metal bit out of the horse's mouth), brought a bench from the house into the yard, laid out a handful of herbs on the bench, led the horse to the bench, and began offering the animal different dried herbs in turn. The horse ignored some and turned away, but some it sniffed and even tasted. My grandmother threw the bunches that the horse paid attention to into a cast iron pot of water that was resting on coals and lowered her bonnet into it.</p><p>
I heard what she said to the people who had brought the horse: "Come in the morning, the day after tomorrow." When the people left, I realized my grandmother was again planning to disappear somewhere with the horse, and I began asking her to take me along. My grandmother, who always granted all my requests, did not refuse this time either, but she set one condition: Go to bed earlier than usual. I obeyed.</p><p>
My grandmother woke me at dawn. The horse was standing in front of the house covered with a small piece of canvas. After washing my face with the infusion from the cast iron pot, my grandmother gave me a small bundle of food, picked up a rope tied to the horse's bridle, and we set off down the boundary path that separated the gardens and led to the woods that began beyond the gardens. We walked very slowly along the edge of the woods. Or rather, my grandmother walked alongside the horse and stopped every time as soon as the horse lowered its head to the grass and tried some kind of herb. My grandmother held the rein so lightly, it would even slip out of her hands when the horse, suddenly seeing something in the grass, abruptly turned its head to the side.</p><p>
Sometimes my grandmother did lead the horse behind her, but moving to a new spot, she once again would give it full freedom. We walked along the edge of the woods and into them a little. Sometime after noon, we reached a boggy spot in the field. We sat ourselves down to rest and eat our lunch by a haystack from the first mowing. After a snack of milk and bread, tired from the long day's march, I felt sleepy. Right then, my grandmother took a small coat out of her bundle, spread it out by the haystack, and suggested, "You lie down and sleep, grandson. You're all tuckered out, I’m afraid."</p><p>
I lay down and began fighting sleep, afraid my grandmother and the horse would enigmatically disappear without me, but sleep won out.</p><p>
When I woke up, I saw my grandmother picking certain herbs next to the horse's snout and putting them away in her bundle. Soon after we set off in the direction of home, but we took a different route now. When it started growing dark, I got sleepy again, and once again my grandmother made my bed on the coat. She woke me up after dark, and once again we continued on our way home. From time to time, I heard my grandmother saying something to the horse. The words' meaning didn't stick, but I clearly remembered her voice's intonation: calm, kind, and joyous. At home, she immediately began watering the horse, adding the infusion from the cast iron to the bucket.</p><p>
Then I saw her give the people who came for the horse the bundles of herbs she had picked during our journey and explain something to them.</p><p>
The horse, slightly revived, left our yard reluctantly, already harnessed again and pulled along by the rein, turning its head toward my grandmother.</p><p>
For a few days, I was angry at my grandmother for not showing me how witches disappear and just grazing the horse the whole time, picking herbs, and tying them into bundles.</p><p>
I would have quickly forgotten our trip and sorcery, but when I told the playmate who had called my grandmother a witch that she never disappeared, she just grazed sick animals, he, a little older than me, cited a weighty argument which neither I nor the village boys who were on my side could counter. "Then why, every time the chairman rides by your yard, does his horse stop running and just walks by, and won't even obey the whip?"</p><p>
I don't remember how my grandmother explained that for me. Only now have I understood the reason: clarity and the confidence that many people could heal animals the way she did if they had a good heart and paid close attention to nature and animals.</p><p>
Now I understood. By allowing the ailing horse to try the different bundles of herbs, she was simply determining which herbs the ill animal felt a need for, and in this way she mapped out our route, so that we would come across those herbs along the way, as well as those which she did not have on hand at that moment.</p><p>
She needed to go away for an entire day because each plant has its most favorable hours for ingesting. She held the rein loose so that the horse could determine which herbs, and in what quantity, it needed. In some inexplicable way, animals sense this. Since the infusion was made of herbs the animal itself had chosen, the washing with it and soaking of her bonnet in the infusion probably was done so that the animal would be better disposed toward us. How simple it all turns out to be. I have no idea where my barely literate grandmother learned all this. And how we have complicated this simplicity! Isn't this why large-scale epizootics (widespread animal diseases) now rage through Europe, while modern scientific thought has come up with no better solution than to burn tens of thousands of sick animals?</p><p>
I have cited just one example, which speaks to the illusory nature of our modern medicine's achievements, but I could cite many similar examples of the deceptive achievements of modern society. However, why bother with particulars and details if we can go right to the main thing?</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>To Live in a Beautiful Reality</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>What kind of society do we generally live in today? What are we striving for? What do we propose to build in the future? The overwhelming majority would unhesitatingly reply, "We live in a democratic state and are doing our best to build a free democratic society like those of developed, civilized Western countries."</p><p>
This is exactly how most politicians and political experts would answer.</p><p>
This is exactly what is said on our TV screens and written in our newspapers.</p><p>
This is exactly what the majority of people in our country believe.</p><p>
This opinion of the majority proves Anastasia's assertion that today some modern people are now asleep. Still others have been programmed and are biorobots in the hands of a few priests who imagine themselves rulers of the world.</p><p>
If we step back a little from the feverish and monotonous daily bustle and think independently, we can understand the following.</p><p>
Democracy! What is this in general? What concept defines the word itself? Many would reply by quoting either the Great Encyclopedic Dictionary or the Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian Language, which give more or less identical and laconic definitions: "Democracy is a form of state and political arrangement of society based on a recognition of the people as the source of power. The fundamental principles of democracy are the rule of the majority, the equality of citizens . . ."</p><p>
People in highly developed democratic countries choose parliaments and presidents by a majority of votes.</p><p>
Choose? Total delirium! Total illusion! They have no choice! Not once, in no country considered the most democratic and civilized, have the people ever been in power.</p><p>
Elections? They are totally illusory! Remember what always happens before elections in any so-called democratic country. Groups of political experts from the candidates battle among themselves, spending tremendous sums on sophisticated methods of psychological influence through the media, television, and blatant propaganda.</p><p>
The more highly developed the country, the more sophisticated the means of influence are.</p><p>
It is perfectly obvious that the team of political experts able to bring to bear the most influence and suggestion wins. It is under the effect of this suggestion that people later go and vote. They think they are voting according to their own wishes. In fact, they are carrying out someone else's will.</p><p>
In this way, modern democracy is an illusion of the human masses, their belief in the false construction of a community, an unreal and false world.</p><p>
</p><p>Indeed, there is no such thing in nature as obedience to the majority. All the communities of plants, animals, and insects can obey instinct, the movement of the planets, the order established by nature, the leader of the herd, and human society has always been controlled by a minority.</p><p>
It was not the majority that planned revolutions and started wars, but under the purposeful suggestion of the minority, the majority took part in the revolutions and wars. That is how it was and how it is.</p><p>
Democracy is a very dangerous illusion to which a huge number of people have been subjected. It is dangerous because in the democratic world, one or a few people can easily control all democratic countries. All it takes is a lot of money and a good team of psychologists and political experts.</p><p>
We, today's parents, finding ourselves under the sway of illusions, are also trying to raise our children, but in fact we are leading and pushing their consciousness into an illusory world. In fact, we are turning them over to . . . Well, certainly not God. We are turning them over to the opposite.</p><p>
God's world is not illusory, but real and beautiful. It has its own unsurpassed fragrances, colors, shapes, and sounds. The gates to this world are always open, and you can enter them if you free yourself from the illusions that confuse consciousness.</p><p>
I, too, will write my own FAMILY BOOK for my descendants and for myself. And along with everything else, I will definitely write in it the following. "I, Vladimir Megre, lived in a time when humanity did not exist in the real world. Man's flesh nourished itself with the gifts of the real world, but his consciousness wandered in an illusory one. This was a very difficult period for people. Now I am trying to return my consciousness to the real, Divine world. This Divine world of nature has suffered from people's consciousness. Suffered badly. I have understood this and will try to correct it. As much as I can, as much as I have time for, perhaps, I will only create the plan for my homestead or perhaps only a part of it. The main thing is to understand and for my children to understand."</p><p>
Anastasia was still sitting quietly beside me and listening to me reason out loud. When I fell silent, she stood up and walked to the window.</p><p>
"The stars are coming out in the sky. It's time for me to leave, Vladimir. You are right in many ways. But I hope your new visions of reality do not instill in you the desire to guide people. Resist the temptations and do not join any organizations. Other people see the reality, too. They have organized and are doing something important on Earth. You will understand your own purpose in life."</p><p>
"I am not aspiring to join anything or guide anyone, Anastasia. What purpose of mine are you talking about?"</p><p>
"The time will come and you will sense it yourself. Right now you have gone to bed. Go to sleep and rest. You're excited. Your untrained heart might not withstand the excitement."</p><p>
"Yes. I know. But if I fall asleep, you'll leave. You always leave. Sometimes I don't really want you to leave. I want you to be by my side always."</p><p>
"I am always by your side. When you think of me. Soon you will begin to feel this and you will understand. Now get washed and go to sleep."</p><p>
"I won't be able to go to sleep. Lately I've had a hard time falling asleep in general. My thoughts keep me awake."</p><p>
"I will help you, Vladimir. Do you want me to recite verse readers have sent and sing you a lullaby?"</p><p>
"Please, maybe I will be able to sleep."</p><p>
When I had washed and lain down in my readied bed, Anastasia perched beside me and lay her hand on my brow. Then she ran it over my hair and softly began to sing a song written by one of my readers from Ukraine. Anastasia sang very softly, only it seemed as though many people and the stars could hear her voice. They could hear her pure voice and words:</p><p>
Here is my hand,</p><p>
There will come a day, another day,</p><p>
Tomorrow, but for now</p><p>
Lay your cheek down, lay.</p><p>
</p><p>Hour after hour,</p><p>
So you may be blessed with sleep,</p><p>
I will stroke your hair,</p><p>
And from you sorrow I will keep.</p><p>
</p><p>With blue will I cover you,</p><p>
And with embroidered stars.</p><p>
I have lived here of old,</p><p>
And if you keep me in your heart,</p><p>
You shall never know cold.</p><p>
</p><p>Out of the night will I come</p><p>
Out of ages without cease.</p><p>
I have learned to heal,</p><p>
If your faith you put in me.</p><p>
My hands your ache will ease.</p><p>
</p><p>From above you and past</p><p>
A stone will tumble.</p><p>
I know how to forecast</p><p>
Where you will stumble.</p><p>
</p><p>To the temple, the palace,</p><p>
A hero, you shall go.</p><p>
Ladies beautiful, countless,</p><p>
My body will hide from show.</p><p>
</p><p>I, too, shall reside</p><p>
In a world stark and narrow,</p><p>
So none shall ever need</p><p>
A sword or an arrow,</p><p>
</p><p>If you, if you,</p><p>
If you give me your love.</p><p>
</p><p>My faithful dove</p><p>
To the crane will I free.</p><p>
Too tenderly do I love</p><p>
To live in your dream.</p><p>
</p><p>Before plunging into a deep and peaceful sleep, I had time to think: "Of course, tomorrow will be another day. It will be better. I will describe the dawn of the new day. And many people will begin to write in their own family books how the beautiful new dawn of humanity began. These will be the greatest historical books for our descendants for thousands of years. Mine will be one among them. Tomorrow I will begin writing a new book, and now I will no longer write so incoherently. The new book will be about the new, historic turn of the people of the Earth toward the beautiful, Divine reality."</p><p>
Until we meet again, dear readers, in the new and beautiful reality!</p><p>
Vladimir Megre</p><p class=tbc>

</p><p>
The life of a human being! On what and whom does it depend? Why do some become emperors and commanders while others collect garbage at dumps?</p><p>
There is the common opinion that each person has a destiny predetermined for him from birth. If this is so, then the human being is merely an insignificant cog in the system of some mechanism, not a highly organized creation of God.</p><p>
Alternatively, others regard the human being as a self-sufficient creation that contains absolutely all the energies of the universe.</p><p>
However, there is in the human being one energy inherent in him alone—the "energy of thought." If man were to understand what he possesses and learn to use it to the full extent, he would become master of the entire universe.</p><p>
Which of these two mutually exclusive definitions is true?</p><p>
To sort this out, let us recall an old parable that has become almost a joke.</p><p>
</p><p>A man, vexed at his life, ran into a woods at the edge of town, raised his fists skyward, and shouted, addressing God:</p><p>
"I cannot continue my life. There is injustice and chaos in Your earthly enterprise. Some people ride around town in expensive cars and eat in restaurants, while others collect garbage at dumps. I, for example, do not even have enough money to buy new shoes. If You are just, God, if You exist at all, then make my lottery ticket win the big prize.</p><p>
The clouds parted, a sunbeam touched the shouting man warmly and tenderly, and a calm voice spoke from the sky.</p><p>
"Calm yourself, My son. I am prepared to carry out your request."</p><p>
The man was overjoyed. He's walking down the street, smiling, looking at the shop windows with pleasure, imagining which goods he will acquire with the prize from his lottery ticket.</p><p>
A year passed. The man won nothing. He decided that God had deceived him.</p><p>
Thoroughly vexed, he went to the same place in the woods where he had heard God's promise and shouted, "You did not keep your promise, God. You deceived me. I waited an entire year. I dreamed of the purchases I would make with my prize money. But a year has passed, and I never did win a prize."</p><p>
"Oh, My son," said the sad celestial voice. "You wanted to win a lot of money in the lottery. Why didn't you buy a single ticket all year?"</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
It's a common little parable-joke. People laugh at the man's failure: "How could he not realize that in order for his dream to come true, for him to get the lottery prize, he first had to acquire at least one lottery ticket. But the man did not perform the most obvious action."</p><p>
What is important here is not the parable itself, or whether what it talks about did in fact happen. What is most important is people's attitude toward the events that occur.</p><p>
The fact that people laugh at the man's slow-wittedness speaks to the fact that intuitively, unconsciously perhaps, people understand that their own future life depends not only on some Higher Forces, on Divine providence, but on their very own selves.</p><p>
</p><p>Now let each person try to analyze his own life situations. Have you done everything necessary to make your dream come true?</p><p>
I dare say, and not without grounds, that any dream, even if it seems unreal and completely fantastic, can come true if the person who wants what he desires to happen performs simple and logical actions toward this dream.</p><p>
This assertion can be illustrated by a number of examples. Here is one of them.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0702>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>2. Bride of an English Lord</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Once, at a small market in Vladimir, I happened to be witness to a confrontation between a young female seller and a drunk male customer.</p><p>
The young woman was selling cigarettes, had evidently only worked for a few days and still did not know her goods very well. She mixed up the names of the cigarettes and so served her customers slowly. A small line formed—a few people. The drunk man standing at its end said loudly to the young woman, "Could you make it a little quicker, you nobody?"</p><p>
The girl's cheeks blazed red. A few people walking by stopped to look at the inefficient young woman seller.</p><p>
The drunk man loudly continued his unflattering commentary. He wanted two packs of Prima cigarettes, but when it came his turn, the young woman refused to serve him. Flushed from embarrassment and obviously barely holding back tears, she told the customer, "Your behavior is insulting, and I refuse to serve you."</p><p>
The male customer fell quiet at first from the unexpected turn of events, then turned around to the growing group of gawkers, and broke out in even more insults.</p><p>
"Look at that puny nobody. When you get married, your man will tell you even worse if you work around the kitchen like a chicken with its head cut off."</p><p>
"But I won't allow my husband to insult me either," the young woman replied.</p><p>
"And who do you think you are, you puny showoff?" the drunk man shouted even louder and more obnoxiously. "She won't let her husband. Maybe you were planning to marry an English lord?"</p><p>
"Maybe I will marry a lord. That's my business," the young woman replied curtly, and she turned away.</p><p>
The situation was heating up. Neither side would back off. Quite a crowd was already watching this exchange—the small market's regulars. Those gathered started shouting humorous remarks about the seller's intention to leave the market and marry an English lord.</p><p>
Another young woman left the next stall and stood next to her friend. They stood silently, nothing more.</p><p>
They stood silently, the two young women, who by all appearances had recently graduated from high school. They stood in front of the people who had gathered to discuss their impudence and their insolence.</p><p>
The most jokes were made concerning the unlikelihood of the desire to marry a lord coming true and a thoroughgoing assessment of the girls' physical attributes and their possibilities.</p><p>
The situation was defused by a young man, the owner of the trading stalls at the market. When he walked up, he first demanded in a stern voice that the young woman sell cigarettes to the customer, but when he received a refusal, he quickly found a solution that satisfied everyone. He took money out of his pocket and said, addressing the young seller, "Dear woman, be so kind as to sell me, please, if it's not asking too much, two packs of Prima cigarettes."</p><p>
"If you please," the young woman replied, giving him the cigarettes.</p><p>
The young man gave the cigarettes to the male customer, the conflict was played out, and the crowd dispersed. This story had a continuation, and a rather unexpected one.</p><p>
Coming to the market for food, I couldn't help each time but notice those two young girls. They worked just as nimbly as their older colleagues, but at the same time they were significantly different from them. Slender and modest, but neatly dressed, without excess makeup, their movements were much more elegant than others'. The young women had been working at the market for almost a year and suddenly disappeared simultaneously.</p><p>
Six months later, in the summer, at the same market, I noticed an elegant young woman walking by the fruit stalls. She was different from many in her proud posture and fashionable, expensive attire. The striking woman was followed by a respectable man with a basket full of different fruits.</p><p>
I recognized the young woman, who attracted enthusiastic male looks and obviously envious female ones, as the cigarette seller's friend.</p><p>
I walked up and explained to the young couple—mostly to the companion guarding the young lady—the reason for my curiosity. The young woman finally recognized me. We sat down at a table in an open air café, and Natasha, as she was called, told me about the events of the last eighteen months.</p><p>
"That day, when in front of many market regulars Katya had a conflict with a customer, we decided to quit, so that people wouldn't laugh at us. Remember, at the time Katya said she was going to marry an English lord, and people laughed at what she said. That meant they were going to keep laughing and pointing at us, we decided.</p><p>
"But we couldn't find work anywhere else. At the time we'd only just graduated from high school, and we weren't accepted at the institute. Fine, I was a mediocre student, but Katya was nearly at the top of her class. And she did well on her entrance exams, but she didn't go. They had cut the number of free slots at the institute, and she had no way of paying for her studies. Her mama made very little and she had no father. That's why we got jobs as sellers in the market, and no one gave us work anywhere else.</p><p>
"We worked and prepared to go to the institute the next year. A week after the incident at the market, though, Katya suddenly said to me, 'I have to prepare myself to be the worthy wife of an English lord. Do you want to study together?'</p><p>
"I thought my friend was joking, but that wasn't it at all. Katya had been persistent in school, too.</p><p>
"In the library she found the program of the Institute of Well-Born Young Ladies, and she adapted it to modern times. We started studying according to Katya's program, as if we were possessed.</p><p>
"We studied dancing, aerobics, and English history, language, the rules of good taste and manners. We watched political discussions on television so that we could have conversations with intelligent people. Even at work at the stalls we tried to comport ourselves as if we were at a society reception, so our manners would be natural.</p><p>
"We took our pay but didn't spend it on ourselves. We didn't even buy makeup; we were economizing. We saved money to have a decent outfit made and to buy a tour package to England.</p><p>
"Katya said English lords didn't go to the little Vladimir market. That meant we had to go to England for our chances to rise significantly.</p><p>
"We arrived in England with our tour group. The two weeks flew by quickly. Naturally, as you yourself realize, English lords did not greet us or accompany us. I wasn't counting on anything at all and was doing it just to keep Katya company. But she hoped. She's aggressive. She kept looking into Englishmen's faces, searching for her destiny. Twice we even went to a dance club, but no one invited us to dance even once.</p><p>
"On the day of departure, we were already on our way from the hotel to the bus to go to the airport, and Katya was still hoping, still looking around. We stopped on the steps, Katya suddenly put down her suitcase, looked to the side, and said, 'Here he comes.'</p><p>
"I saw a young man walking down the sidewalk toward the hotel entrance, thinking his own thoughts, not even looking at us. As I expected, when he came even with us he didn't even glance at Katya and walked by.</p><p>
"Suddenly, Katya—she had to come up with something—called out to him loudly.</p><p>
"The young man turned in our direction. Slowly but decisively, Katya walked up to him and said in English, 'My name is Katya. I'm from Russia. Right now I'm leaving for the airport on this bus with my tour group. I approached you . . . I sensed I could be a very good wife for you. I don't love you yet, but I can, and you will love me. We will have fine children. There will be a boy and a girl. We will be happy. And now, if you like, you can see me off at the airport.'</p><p>
"The young Englishman looked at Katya very seriously and said nothing in reply. He was probably shocked at this unexpected turn. Then he said he had a serious business meeting, wished her a good journey, and left.</p><p>
"All the way to the airport Katya looked silently out the bus window, and we didn't say a word to each other. It was a little awkward for me and Katya in front of the other tourists, who had witnessed this scene at the hotel entrance. My skin could actually feel people laughing at Katya and judging her.</p><p>
"But when we arrived at the airport, as she walked down the bus steps, Katya was met by this young Englishman with an enormous bouquet of flowers.</p><p>
"She put her suitcase on the pavement—no, she simply tossed her suitcase aside, didn't take the bouquet, and clung to his chest and began to weep.</p><p>
"He dropped the bouquet and the flowers scattered. The group and I pick up the flowers, and the two are standing there. The Englishman is stroking Katya's hair. As if there was no one around, he tells her quickly what a fool he was, that he nearly let his destiny slip, and that if he hadn't caught her he would have gone on to suffer his whole life, and he kept thanking Katya for finding him.</p><p>
"The plane was late taking off. I won't tell you how, but I was the one who delayed it.</p><p>
"Her Englishman turned out to come from an English diplomatic family, and he himself was planning to work at some embassy.</p><p>
"When we returned to Russia, he called Katya every day. They would talk for a long time. Now Katya is in England and pregnant. I think they truly love each other, and now I believe in love at first sight."</p><p>
After telling me this amazing story, Natasha smiled at her companion sitting at the table. I asked whether they'd known each other for long, and the young man answered, 'I was in that tour group, too. When the Englishman scattered the flowers, Natasha started picking them up, and I started helping her pick up the flowers. Now here I am following her with a basket of fruit. What do we care about English lords!'</p><p>
Natasha gently placed her hand on her companion's shoulder and said smiling, "Yes, and what do they care about you—Russian men."</p><p>
Then the happy young woman turned toward me. "Andrei and I got married a month ago, and now we've come to visit my parents."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
Learning the story of these two young women, many think they were lucky beneficiaries of an unusual situation. But I would assert that in this case, the situation was absolutely usual and logical. Moreover, I contend that, repeating the chain of actions of Katya and Natasha, other young women could realize for themselves a similar outcome. The names and personalities of their chosen ones would differ, of course, as would the time it would take, but the fact that a similar situation could happen to others is predetermined. By whom? By the young women themselves—by their way of thinking and subsequent logical actions.</p><p>
Judge for yourself. Katya had a dream or a purpose, to marry an Englishman. It doesn't matter the influence under which she began dreaming of this. More than likely, she didn't like the atmosphere of the market, the drunks, the crudeness, and perhaps the gibes of the rude customer, and so her dream appeared.</p><p>
And so? Plenty of young women dream of a prince in a white Mercedes, but they still marry ordinary failures. For most, dreams do not come true.</p><p>
I agree that they don't, of course, but only because their actions, or rather their inaction with respect to their dream, is like the anecdotal situation with the lottery ticket—the man who dreamt of winning, even asking God for help, but did not take the most elementary action of buying at least one lottery ticket.</p><p>
The young women acted, and a definite sequence was set up: dream—thought—actions. Try discarding even one element from this chain, and the young women's fate would have been completely different.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0703>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>3. Your Destiny Created by You</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Man's destiny! Many routinely think that someone higher shapes their destiny, and this someone simply puts the greatest universal energy at each person's disposal, an energy capable of shaping the possessor's destiny and creating new galaxies. This energy is called "human thought."</p><p>
However, the knowledge alone that this is so does not suffice. This phenomenon must be apprehended and felt.</p><p>
How fully we are able to apprehend it, to feel and understand it, depends on the degree to which the secrets of the universe, the mechanisms of wonders, or rather, logical phenomena, are revealed to us.</p><p>
Only the awareness and acceptance of the energy of thought allows us to make our life and the lives of those near to us happier, and it is a happy life that is predetermined for man.</p><p>
So, we must be firmly convinced of the indisputability of the following conclusions.</p><p>
First, the human being is a thinking being.</p><p>
Second, the energy of thought has no equal in power in the Universe. Everything we see, as well as we ourselves, have been created by the energy of thought.</p><p>
</p><p>We can list the names of millions of objects—from the primitive hammer to the spaceship—and the appearance of each of them will have been preceded by a thought.</p><p>
The imagination constructs a material object in a dimension invisible to us. We don't yet see its materialization, but that certainly doesn't mean that the object doesn't exist. It has already been constructed in the dimension of thought, and this is more significant than its subsequent materialization.</p><p>
The thought of one or several people builds a spaceship. We don't see it yet, we can't touch it, and at the same time, it exists! It exists in a dimension invisible to us, and subsequently it materializes, taking on a shape visible to our ordinary sight.</p><p>
What is most significant in the creation of a spaceship? The thought of the inventor and designer or the actions of the worker turning out the details according to the blueprints provided? Of course, in this instance all the labor is essential. Nonetheless, thought is primary.</p><p>
There can be an accident with a real spaceship, due not only to some faulty piece but also to an imprecisely worked-out thought. In the popular imagination, this is called "thoughtlessness."</p><p>
Thought can predict all accidents. There are no unforeseen situations for thought. But accidents and every possible muddle do occur. Why? They rushed with the materialization, not letting thought perfect the plan.</p><p>
Thus, after giving independent thought, each person can himself be convinced of the indisputability of the following conclusion: all the objects that have ever been manufactured on Earth are the materialization of thought.</p><p>
One must now realize that absolutely all life situations, including life itself, are first shaped in thoughts.</p><p>
The visible world of living nature, including man himself, was shaped originally by the thought of God.</p><p>
Man, like God, has the capacity to shape with his thought new objects and the course of his own life.</p><p>
If your thought is weakly developed or if under certain influences is not allowed to make free use of its inherent energy and speed, someone else's thought will affect your life situations—possibly the thought of the people dear to you, your acquaintances, generally accepted social attitudes.</p><p>
In the latter case, however, your life situations are set up first by human thought. It is your own fault if you have squeezed and enslaved your thought and thereby submitted to the will of another person's thoughts, and your failures and success will now depend on this other person or other people.</p><p>
Many vital examples can convince you of the above. Think. What does a person do before becoming a famous artist? Of course, first he dreams about this, then he mentally draws up a plan for achieving his dream and goes on to act: amateur activity, the appropriate educational institutions, taking work in a theater, film studio, or philharmonic.</p><p>
People may object that everyone dreams of being the most famous artist, but only a very few become that, and some are forced to look for work in another field not connected with their artistic career: it takes not only a dream but talent. Yes, talent is essential, but talent, too, is produced by the power of thought.</p><p>
Physical and natural attributes? Of course, they are important. But once again, thought is not so foolish as to come up with a plan for a one-legged person to go to ballet school.</p><p>
The reader might wonder, if everything, even one's profession and well-being, depends on one's own thoughts, then why isn't everyone rich and famous, and why do some drag out a pitiful existence, digging around dumps in search of food?</p><p>
So let's go to the dump in the direct sense of the word.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0704>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>4. Thought at a Dump</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
I did this in the following way. I went without shaving, rumpled my hair, borrowed some old work clothes from a painter I knew, and taking a plastic bag and a stick, I walked over to a dumpster. I dug around in the garbage with my stick, found a few empty bottles, put them in the bag, and went to the garbage bin next to a nearby apartment building. My efforts were crowned with success. Ten minutes or so later, fifteen at most, as I was standing by the second garbage bin, I was nearly attacked by a man holding a metal rod.</p><p>
"Don't touch what's not yours," he said in a tone of voice that brooked no objections.</p><p>
"This is your territory, you mean?" I asked calmly, moving a little away from the bin, and at the same time gave him my bag of bottles.</p><p>
"Who else's?" my assailant replied less aggressively now, taking my bag and rummaging through the contents, ignoring me.</p><p>
"Maybe you can show me where there's free ones around here?" I asked, and I added, "I'm in a bad way."</p><p>
"It'll cost you," the trash bin's unofficial owner turned to me.</p><p>
I went to the store and bought a bottle of vodka and some snacks. We introduced ourselves over our drinking, and Pavel told me about lots of the subtleties of his trade, and there are quite a few.</p><p>
You have to know what days to watch especially carefully that no interlopers like me horn in and steal what's yours. These are the days after holidays, when even more bottles are thrown out than usual. You also have to know which discarded things contain ferrous metals and how to collect them, which buyers pay most for empties and ferrous metals, and what to do with discarded but still wearable clothing.</p><p>
I tried to shift the conversation to other subjects.</p><p>
Pavel could express his opinions on politics and the government, but with much less interest. His thoughts worked in one direction—dumpsters.</p><p>
To be completely convinced of this, I made him the following offer.</p><p>
"You know, Pavel, there's this guy not far from here building a house. He needs guards for the winter, and if he needs help in the construction, too, then he'll pay additionally and provide the guard with food. His driver brings potatoes, onions, and groats every week. You're a good guy. He'd take you on. If you want, we can go and talk to him."</p><p>
After our drink, we'd become friends, as you'd expect. This made his abrupt change in mood even more unexpected for me. At first Pavel thought intensely for half a minute. Then he looked me over silently, hostilely, for half a minute and finally said what he had to say.</p><p>
"You think I'm drunk and can't think anymore? You snake, you thought you'd make me a guard and then you could have my dumpsters?"</p><p>
He didn't even ask what the pay was for a guard, what the housing was like, or precisely what jobs on the site needed doing for additional pay. His thought was wholly focused on his dumpsters and on deciding the best way to deal with them and protect them from competitors.</p><p>
You see, the man himself directed his own thought—to solve the question of his own existence at the expense of dumpsters—and he followed his thought.</p><p>
Many more examples could be cited confirming the indisputability of the fact that the creation of all objects, life situations, and social phenomena is preceded by the energy of thought.</p><p>
Using his own thought, one person can influence another. The most ancient sayings and parables attest to this. Here is what Anastasia's grandfather told me about the energy of human thought.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0705>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>5. A Wife is a Goddess</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
"Yes, Vladimir, man's thought possesses unsurpassed energy. People regard many of this energy's creations as magic and call them miracles formed in their conception by Higher Powers.</p><p>
"For example, there are miracle-working icons. Why did they suddenly become miracle-working? Why did a piece of wooden board with an image imposed on it by human hand suddenly become miracle-working? This happens when the person painting the icon invests in it a sufficient quantity of his own psychic energy. Later, those who look at it, add their own. There is the concept known as the 'prayed-upon icon'—in other words, an icon that has been invested with a great deal of the energies of human thoughts.</p><p>
"Previously, those who painted icons knew about the properties of great energy. Before proceeding to work, the artists fasted, cleansing their organism of what was undesired, and thereby strengthened their own thought. Then they entered into a state of detachment, concentrating their energy upon a single matter, painting the icon. When it was completely ready, they looked at what they had done for a long time, and so sometimes miracles were worked.</p><p>
"Sometimes people see unusual phenomena, various kinds of angels. Notice, though, people always see only those about whom they are thinking. They always see only images of what they believe in.</p><p>
"Christians, for example, can only see their own saints. Muslims only their own. This is because they see the projection of their own or the collective thought.</p><p>
"Fifteen hundred years ago, people who understood the properties and power of the energy of human thoughts told parables about this. Do you want me to tell you one of them?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"I'll translate it from the ancient language into the modern and replace the objects that figured in it before into modern ones, so that the essence is clearer. Tell me just one thing. What does a man who has been married to a woman for more than a year most often do today? What does he do when he comes home?"</p><p>
"Well, lots, if they don't drink, sit down in front of the television, read the paper, and watch television. They might take out the garbage if their wife asks them to."</p><p>
"And the women?"</p><p>
"Well, women—obviously—they cook in the kitchen and then wash the dishes."</p><p>
"I see. It will be easy to translate an ancient parable into modern form."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
Once upon a time there lived in the world an ordinary husband and wife. The wife's name was Elena, the man's Ivan.</p><p>
The husband would come home from work, sit in the armchair by the television, and read the paper. His wife, Elena, would cook dinner. She would serve her husband dinner and grumble that he did nothing useful around the house and made too little money. His wife's grumbling would irritate Ivan. He wouldn't say anything rude in reply, he would just think privately, "She's a sloppy hag herself, and she's making comments. When I just married, she was completely different, pretty and kind."</p><p>
One day, when his grumbling wife asked Ivan to take out the garbage, he reluctantly tore himself away from the television and went into the courtyard. Returning, he stopped by the apartment house doors and prayed silently to God.</p><p>
"My God, my God! What a muddled life mine's turned out to be. Am I really going to have to live my whole life with a wife like this? Grumbling and ugly to boot? This isn't life, it's nothing but torture."</p><p>
Suddenly, Ivan heard the quiet voice of God.</p><p>
"I could help you in your misfortune, My son. I could give you a beautiful goddess for a wife, but if your neighbors see a sudden change in your fate, they will be greatly mystified. Let's try this. I will gradually change your wife and instill in her the spirit of a goddess and improve her appearance. Only you must remember. If you want to live with a goddess, your life has to be worthy of a goddess."</p><p>
"Thank you, God. Any guy would change his life for the sake of a goddess. Just tell me this. When will you start making changes with my wife?"</p><p>
"I will change her a little right now, and every minute I will change her for the better."</p><p>
Ivan walked into his apartment, sat down in his armchair, picked up the newspaper, and turned the television back on. Only he didn't feel like reading or watching a movie. He couldn't wait to look. Had his wife indeed changed just a little?</p><p>
He stood up, opened the kitchen door, leaned against the doorjamb, and began to examine his wife closely. She was standing with her back to him, washing the dishes left after dinner.</p><p>
Elena suddenly felt his gaze and turned toward the door. Their eyes met. Ivan examined his wife and thought, "No, no changes in my wife."</p><p>
Seeing her husband's unusual attention and understanding nothing, Elena suddenly fixed her hair, and her cheeks flushed when she asked, "What is it, Ivan? Why are you looking at me so closely?"</p><p>
Her husband couldn't think of what to say, and embarrassed himself, suddenly said, "Maybe I can help you wash the dishes? For some reason I thought . . . , "</p><p>
"The dishes? Help me?" his amazed wife asked quietly, removing her soiled apron. "But I've already washed them."</p><p>
"Well, that's great. She's changing right before my eyes," Ivan thought. "All of a sudden, she's prettier."</p><p>
And he started drying the dishes.</p><p>
The next day after work, Ivan hurried home impatiently. Oh, he couldn't wait to see his grumbling wife being gradually transformed into a goddess.</p><p>
"What if there were suddenly a lot of the goddess in her, and I didn't change at all, like before? Just in case, I'll buy some flowers so I put my best foot forward."</p><p>
The door opened, and a bewitched Ivan was lost for words. Elena stood before him in her party dress, the one he'd bought her the year before. She had a ribbon in her tidy hair. He became flustered and awkwardly handed her the flowers. He couldn't take his eyes off Elena.</p><p>
She took the flowers and gasped slightly, lowering her eyelashes, and began to glow.</p><p>
"Oh, how beautiful the goddess's eyelashes are! How meek her character! How unusual her inner beauty and outward appearance!"</p><p>
Ivan gasped in turn when he saw the table set with their good service, two candles lit on the table, two wineglasses, and food drawing him with divine aromas.</p><p>
When he sat down at the table, his wife Elena sat down across form him, too, but suddenly jumped up, saying, "Forgive me, I forgot to turn on the television for you. And here, I got fresh newspapers for you."</p><p>
"I don't need the television, and I don't feel like reading the papers. It's always the same thing in them," Ivan replied sincerely. "Why don't you tell me how you'd like to spend your Saturday tomorrow?"</p><p>
Completely stunned, Elena asked him, "What about you?"</p><p>
"I had a chance to buy two theater tickets for us. But maybe in the afternoon you'd agree to go shopping. If we're going to be going to the theater, we should first stop by a store and buy a proper dress for you to go to the theater."</p><p>
Ivan nearly blurted out the words "a proper dress for a goddess." He grew confused, looked at her, and gasped again. Sitting before him at the table was a goddess. Her face shone with happiness, and her eyes gleamed. Her intimate smile held a small question.</p><p>
"Oh, my God, how beautiful goddesses are! And if she gets prettier every day, will I be able to be worthy of her?" Ivan thought, and a thought struck him like lightning. "I have to! I have to while my goddess is by my side. I have to ask her, and beg her to have my child. The child will be from me and the most beautiful goddess."</p><p>
"What are you thinking about, Ivan? Is that excitement I see on your face?" Elena asked her husband.</p><p>
He sat there agitated, not knowing how to utter his most cherished thought. It's no joke to ask a goddess for a child. God did not promise him a gift like that. Ivan didn't know how to express his wish, and he stood up, tugging the tablecloth, and said, turning red, "I don't know. . . . Maybe. . . . But I . . . wanted to say. . . . For a long time . . . . Yes, I want a child from you, beautiful goddess.'</p><p>
She, Elena, walked up to Ivan, her husband. From her love-filled eyes, a happy tear rolled down her rosy cheek. She put her hand on Ivan's shoulder and scorched him with her hot breath.</p><p>
"Oh, it was night! Now it is morning! This is day! Oh, how beautiful life is with a goddess!" thought Ivan, as he put a coat on his second grandson to go for a walk.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"What did you understand from that parable, Vladimir?"</p><p>
"I understood everything. God didn't help Ivan. He simply heard God's voice. Ivan turned his wife into a goddess with his thought."</p><p>
"Naturally, that's correct. Ivan created his own happiness with his own thought. He made his wife into a goddess and changed himself. But God did help Ivan."</p><p>
"When?"</p><p>
"Back then, when God gave each person everything, when he contemplated the creation of man. And he explained to the first of those created. You must remember God's words from Co-Creation: 'My son, you are infinite, you are eternal. Your creative dreams are in you.'</p><p>
"These words are true to this day, Vladimir. Each person has creative dreams. The only question is what they are aimed at and how strong is thought and its energy in today's sons and daughters living on His earth."</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0706>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>6. What is your Thought doing Right Now?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
I am not going to belabor the reader with further examples. Each person can determine independently from his own life which of his thoughts are his own and which the thoughts of others.</p><p>
In order to conclude, let us take the obvious as our foundation: thought is primary to everything.</p><p>
I have already said that before someone can not just understand but also feel this, many secrets of the universe will be revealed. Above all, a precise picture of co-creation will be laid out.</p><p>
God created the world we live in with the help of His dream and the energy of His thought. He created man, gave him full freedom of action, and allotted to each person the most powerful energy capable of creating not only similar worlds but also worlds that surpass earthly ones in perfection.</p><p>
In order to create new worlds or perfect the world already created, man's thought must be as fast as God's.</p><p>
However, if we look at the world being created today by the human community, we can obviously see not only its imperfection, but also its increasing threat to existence. Consequently, there has been an obvious degradation of consciousness going on, or rather, the speed of thought has decreased.</p><p>
The very first people possessed a speed of thought equal to God's. It could not be otherwise, since God, like any creator-parent, could not even contemplate creating His child as less competent than Himself.</p><p>
What forces could affect human consciousness and set it down the path of degradation? If someone has enough strength, then he must surpass the energy of thought of man and God. But there is no such being on earth or outside earthly existence.</p><p>
The proof of this assertion could not be simpler. If there did exist an essence with a speed of thought greater than man's, it would have long since created its own world and we would have been able to behold it.</p><p>
Only human thought can redirect and enslave the energy of human thought. In other words, one person possessing greater speed of thought than others, and wishing to subordinate others to himself, could, under certain circumstances, do this.</p><p>
In the present-day situation, the human community is subject to the descendants of the Egyptian priests who preserved the knowledge of the science of imagery and with the help of special exercises maintained the ability to think with a speed much greater than many others living on earth.</p><p>
And there are circumstances that confirm this state of affairs.</p><p>
One person proved capable of countering the priests singlehandedly. Of course, I speak of the hermit of the Siberian taiga, Anastasia. Notice that she has achieved tangible results without the help of any army or technological superstructure, but merely with the power of her own thought.</p><p>
The fact that, with the start of the new millennium, humanity has begun to move into the world of a beautiful and Divine civilization is an indisputable fact for me personally. I want to share the good news with my readers.</p><p>
I have information about a few groups of scientists who, independently of each other, began working on a program for developing the state whose image was created by Anastasia. People with academic degrees and university students are working on these programs.</p><p>
Preparing a detailed program will take a few years of persistent work by a whole army of specialists. But you can read their first notes and see for yourself right now.</p><p>
For instance, at www.Anastasia.ru, a published paper by a fourth-year student at a Ukrainian university proposes a program for the development of Ukraine. It takes as its basis Anastasia's idea of homesteads. Drafts for the charters of future settlements have been sent in by people from various regions and countries of the former Soviet Union.</p><p>
It is not for me to judge the quality of the Ukrainian student's paper, but it is significant if only because it is the first to be published. Also very important is the fact that scientists have begun working on these programs not under someone's order, but at the behest of their own heart.</p><p>
Soon, you will be familiarizing yourself with their fundamental works and discussing them. I think these plans will be put up for national discussion and concentrated in a short title: "the national idea."</p><p>
I could have written these lines in my previous book, after my conversation with Anastasia's grandfather. I didn't. I thought it was too soon. As it is, many consider what Anastasia has created to nudge against science fiction or fairy tale.</p><p>
The conversation with her grandfather explained phenomena even more unusual than what Anastasia had previously demonstrated. In general, thanks to him, Anastasia herself appeared in a new light. Now, when the events happening in the human community have begun to confirm what was said in the Siberian taiga, I will cite a portion of my conversation with the Siberian elder.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0707>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>7. A Conversation with Anastasia's Grandfather</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
It took place the day after her great-grandfather passed away.</p><p>
Ordinarily, when dear ones pass away, relatives express sympathy. Lately, Anastasia's grandfather had been inseparably by his father's side. Now that he was left alone, I decided to find him and talk, to distract him from his grief, as is customary. I knew approximately where he might be, so I went to the next glade.</p><p>
Anastasia's grandfather stood at its edge, motionless, looking and listening to the nutcrackers chirping on the branches. He was wearing a long shirt woven of nettle fiber and belted with some kind of plait. He was barefoot.</p><p>
I knew that taiga residents did not think it right to interrupt each other's contemplation. I had begun to understand how high this culture of interaction was. It speaks to respect for the thoughts of the other person.</p><p>
After a while, Anastasia's grandfather turned and walked toward me. When he got close to me, I did not see sorrow on his face; it was as equable as usual.</p><p>
"Good day to you," he reached out to me and we shook hands. In talking, he always built his speech using modern, often quite ordinary words and sometimes joked and kidded me. But not meanly. On the contrary, he made you feel as if you were talking with a relative. It was so easy to talk with him, on any topic, even about what men usually talk about without women.</p><p>
Undoubtedly, Anastasia inherited many of her abilities from her parents and grandparents and, of course, from her grandfather's direct participation in her upbringing.</p><p>
What abilities and knowledge of life were hidden in this gray-haired old man, who had lived more than a hundred years while retaining his sharp intellect and youthful agility? With me he spoke in quite simple words, but once I heard him speaking with his father. I hadn't heard more than half the words before. That meant that when he interacted with others, out of respect for his audience, he used only that vocabulary and idiom.</p><p>
"Well, how are things going there—in your civilized society? Are people beginning to wake up?" the grandfather asked jokingly.</p><p>
"Things are all right," I replied. "Scientists have taken an interest in Anastasia's ideas. Different groups are working on state programs that have her proposals at their base. They are working in other countries as well as in Russia.</p><p>
"But when everything beautiful, as she said, is going to come about in our state and others is still unclear."</p><p>
"Everything already has, Vladimir. The main thing has been done."</p><p>
"What do you mean by 'main'?"</p><p>
"Anastasia has produced the thought—the image of the future state—with her inherent scrupulousness and taken into consideration the minutest details and situations in the materialization of her thought into a future reality.</p><p>
"Now you and many people will observe the materialization of the beautiful future.</p><p>
"The energy of her thought is unusually strong. She has no equal in this dimension.</p><p>
"The energy of her thought is perfect and concrete, but above all, it continues to gain strength at the expense of other people's thoughts. Now she is not alone.</p><p>
"Here you say groups of scientists in different countries are working on state programs, entrepreneurs are beginning to build the homesteads she thought of, and her thought has been accepted by many older and younger people. These people, having come in contact with her thought, are producing their own.</p><p>
"The thoughts of many people, merging into one, are filling the dimension with an energy of unprecedented strength, and this energy is materializing the beautiful future. Right now, individual manifestations of this materialization are already going on."</p><p>
"And if someone intentionally starts to impede the realization of the future?" I asked. "For example, if the priests who now control the world, the high priest himself, begins to impede it?"</p><p>
"He won't. He will help."</p><p>
"Why are you so sure of this?"</p><p>
"I have heard his conversation and seen his thought."</p><p>
"What conversation? What did you see?"</p><p>
"Vladimir, you must have already guessed that my father was one of those six priests."</p><p>
"I never thought anything of the kind."</p><p>
"But you might have, even though outward simplicity and the ability to conceal one's abilities and resources is one of the important components of their might.</p><p>
"They have no need to boast of the power of their weapon, as the rulers of the great powers do. They can freely direct this weapon wherever they want, directing the thoughts of rulers, creating appropriate situations. Not that they ever set themselves the goal of boasting in front of people.</p><p>
"Their secret goal over the millennia was to achieve a dialog with God.</p><p>
"Acting, they did not fear Divine vengeance, knowing that God, having given each person full freedom, would not break His promise.</p><p>
"They controlled humanity, tormented it, and in this way showed God that they were more capable than everyone else, that the fate of earthly civilization depended on them.</p><p>
"A situation like this, they believed, should have brought God into a dialog with them.</p><p>
"But no dialog took place, and now it is clear why there could not be a dialog between God and the priests."</p><p>

Thank You!</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p></br><img class=kumar src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Thank-you-vk.com-kumar82.jpg></div><p>
</p><p>
"When little Anastasia was born and when she was still a tiny child unable to walk without her parents, a fiery sphere would sometimes appear by her side.</p><p>
"My father, like the other priests, knew many natural phenomena, including those which seem puzzling and inexplicable to your present-day scientists, but the might of this fiery sphere was inexplicable to him.</p><p>
"The incomprehensible energy could in one instant dissipate in minute sparks and just as quickly collect into a single whole.</p><p>
"The slenderest ray bursting from the fiery sphere could instantly reduce a huge rock or cliff to dust.</p><p>
"The same ray could tenderly touch the foot of a bug crawling over a flower petal without inflicting any harm on it whatsoever.</p><p>
"Most importantly and incomprehensibly, however, this cluster of the greatest energy reacted to little Anastasia's emotions and desires. That meant that it itself possessed both emotions and thought.</p><p>
"Thought in its fullness is inherent only to the human being. But the fiery sphere is not a human being. Then what is it? Why does it possess feelings inherent to the human being? Where does it get its great power and might?</p><p>
"I have told you, and you described in your book, how it altered the earth's gravitation locally when Anastasia was learning to walk. It shot out thousands of rays and combed the golden hair on the little girl's little head.</p><p>
"Her father speculated about what forces were manifest in this fiery, mighty, and thinking sphere, but he never spoke of it aloud. A conjecture requires confirmation.</p><p>
"When Anastasia grew a little older, we heard her talking with the sphere one day. Or rather, she was always talking. The sphere never uttered words, but it reacted to the child's words with its actions.</p><p>
"My father asked Anastasia about the sphere and she answered briefly: 'It is good.' Her answer was insufficient for my father, but he did not speak with her anymore about the sphere—then or years later.</p><p>
"That initial answer made it clear that Anastasia had no desire to define the fiery sphere itself or its actions. Instead, she perceived it with her feelings. For some reason, however, it was important for my father to understand what was going on with Anastasia's phenomenon.</p><p>
"From the moment of the sphere's first appearance, he ceased to take part in the acts of the priest and concentrated his efforts on solving the puzzle.</p><p>
"The priests know ways of confirming a conjecture or refuting their own surmises. It was essential to make the phenomenon known by a more reliable description of it and to wait for people's reactions and opinions. Moreover, these people could be neither asked nor ordered to express their opinions. The definitions had to arise freely, on the level of emotions, not just intellect, for then they would be the most precise.</p><p>
"Later, at my father's request, I told you about Anastasia's childhood, including the story of her interaction with this puzzling phenomenon. You wrote about it in your book without distorting what you had heard, and—what is very important—you yourself expressed no opinion of your own.</p><p>
"We waited agitatedly for the reaction from the people who had read your books. It followed quickly and was expressed not only in ordinary statements but also in emotional outbursts. People spoke and wrote what my father had conjectured for many years, what he had not said aloud and had hidden from the other priests.</p><p>
"You published the poems of readers written not at anyone's behest, but at the urging of their heart. I'll remind you of the beginning of one of these poems:</p><p>
</p><p>For her birthday</p><p>
God appeared</p><p>
To his beloved Nastenka. . . .</p><p>
</p><p>"This confirmed my father's conjecture. The fiery sphere, which interacts with Anastasia from time to time, is in fact none other than one of the hypostases—or essences—of God.</p><p>
"God has many hypostases; any blade of grade is a manifestation of His thought. But the sphere was, if not the main, then a very great essence, concentrated from many component hypostases, up to and including the energies of intellect and emotions.</p><p>
"Then, one day. . . . This happened after you had written five books—when her words had been published, or rather, her emotional outburst containing these words—'Prepare yourself, malevolence, leave the Earth, attack me!'—had pierced the dark dimension like a fiery sword.</p><p>
"On Anastasia's lips, the words take on the meaning not only of words. You, and not only you, have been convinced of this many times. The malicious, invisible energy began to attack Anastasia.</p><p>
"The white circles began to appear, and the grass turned white. Sometimes, too, Anastasia would lose consciousness for a moment, and we didn't know how to help her.</p><p>
"Our granddaughter did not ask for help from us, and since she didn't ask, that meant she had to withstand it all herself.</p><p>
"Recently, we began noticing the attacks against her increasing in strength, as if, in its agony, malice had tried to make one final, desperate assault.</p><p>
"However, at the same time, our granddaughter's steadfastness was growing. Recently she has only shuddered from successive blows and gone to the shore of the lake.</p><p>
"In some way, the lake's water quickly restored her strength to her. She would splash in the water, dive, and emerge as full of strength as before.</p><p>
"That day, we saw Anastasia, after being subjected to more blows, walk carefully toward the lake.</p><p>
"When she would stop and lean against a cedar trunk to rest, my father said worriedly, 'Today our granddaughter had to overcome something unusual. It was hard for her. Notice the gray locks that have appeared in her golden hair.'</p><p>
"Then we saw Anastasia push off from the trunk, take one step and a second in the direction of the lake, and swaying, stop again.</p><p>
"At this, the fiery sphere arose before her. This time, however, the lightning bolts shining inside it changed color, as if volcanoes were seething within. Suddenly, stormy, fiery arrows pierced the invisible covering, streams of them burst out of the sphere, disappearing in space. However, the sphere did not get smaller. Instead, it increased in girth and became noticeably more solid, and its energies seethed inside it ever more powerfully. It did not hover in space but, like a heart, would squeeze quickly and then expand. Suddenly it fell still, as if deciding something, and thousands of energy bolts burst toward Anastasia.</p><p>
"At some moment, though weak, she was able to raise her arm, and my father and I did not notice, although we were watching what was happening and trying not to blink. We knew the meaning of her gesture; she was stopping the lightning bolt rushing toward her. Why? At the time, we still could not understand.</p><p>
"It was clear to us that the sphere's energy could restore all her powers and, moreover, could give her new vitality, so that no attacks on our granddaughter would be so terrible. So why did she decide to act on her own?</p><p>
"The thousands of rays reaching toward her trembled but did not touch Anastasia, who was standing there with her raised arm. They would disappear in the sphere raging with energies, then burst out again and rush toward her without touching her.</p><p>
"And then suddenly, slowly and gently, she directed these words to the rays and the sphere. 'I beg you to hold back the surge of Your energy. Do not touch me. I can be restored in Your lake. I need to get to it.'</p><p>
"The sphere instantly gathered up all its rays, all of it trembling and pulsing like a heart. It raced upward, sparkled as if it had exploded, and contracted again.</p><p>
"Myriad rays touched everything on the path leading from Anastasia's feet to the lake.</p><p>
"A new vision arose. The path began to shine with millions of pulsing flowers, and an arch of multicolored rainbows formed over the path leading from Anastasia's feet to the lake.</p>

"That path to the lake was the most wonderful picture.</p><p>
"Anastasia was to pass under the triumphal arch.</p><p>
"She took a step, but to the side, not following the path prepared for her by the fiery sphere. She walked slowly to the lake and dove into it, and when she surfaced she simply floated, her arms outstretched, and then began splashing: her powers had returned.</p><p>
"Anastasia's behavior toward the fiery sphere—essentially toward God—lay beyond our understanding.</p><p>
"But what happened afterward was comparable to a revolution in consciousness for all humanity or to a change in the balance of universal energies. Here's what happened then.</p><p>
"Putting her shift over her still-damp body, Anastasia carefully smoothed out its folds, tidied her hair, pressed her hands to her chest, and began to address the dimension.</p><p>
"'My father, who exists in all places, I am Your daughter amidst Your perfect creations.</p><p>
"'I must end the dispute among universal essences about the perfection of Your creations and whether they have no flaw.</p><p>
"'My Father, who exists in all places, You carried out my request and did not touch me.</p><p>
"'Now none of them can say that the earthly paradise can be returned only when God corrects his imperfect creations.</p><p>
"'You do not need to correct anything. Everything was created perfect by You from the beginning. I am not alone, my Father, who exists in all places. There are Your daughters and sons at different ends of the earth. Their aspirations are strong. They will return to the earth its beautiful primordial flowering.</p><p>
"'My Father, who exists in all places, we are Your sons and daughters. Created by you, we are perfection.</p><p>
"'Now we will show everyone our abilities. May our deeds be pleasing to You.'</p><p>
"When Anastasia had uttered these words and fallen silent, the fiery sphere, which hovered still higher, rushed toward the ground. About three meters from Anastasia's feet, it fell into millions of minute sparks and in one instant collected into a single whole, but this whole no longer took the shape of a fiery sphere.</p><p>
"Before Anastasia stood a child of about seven in Earth years. It's hard to say whether it was a little boy or a little girl. Thrown over its childish shoulders was a blue cloth with a hint of violet that seemed as if it had been made out of mist. The child's hair fell to its shoulders. The expression on its childish face was intelligent, confident, and mellow.</p><p>
"More accurately, the expression on the child's face could not be put into words, only emotions, and emotions filled the soul to overflowing.</p><p>
"The child stood barefoot in the grass without flattening the blades.</p><p>
"Anastasia dropped before Him, sat on the grass, and began to look without taking her eyes away from His unusual face.</p><p>
"It seemed that in another instant either He or she would rush to embrace one another. This did not happen.</p><p>
"The child smiled at Anastasia, and diligently uttering each sound, said, 'Thank you to the sons and daughters for their aspirations.'</p><p>
"Then He dissolved in the dimension, and the sphere appeared once again high up, shining with an unprecedented, joyous light. It quickly made several circles over the lake, and for about five minutes warm droplets of rain refreshed the smooth lake and all that grew around it.</p><p>
"This moisture vivified. A few drops fell on my hand and did not roll off, but dissolved, filling my body with contentment.</p><p>
"My father, always imperturbable in any situation, the master of his emotions, was stunned.</p><p>
"As if unaware of his own body, he walked through the taiga, and I followed him.</p><p>
"He walked for several hours, then stopped, and turned to me. A teardrop was rolling down his cheek. Emotions like this are by no means usual in him, one of the high priests, but I saw his tears. My father said calmly and confidently: 'She did it! Anastasia carried people across the dark forces' span of time. The seeds of joyous, happy aspirations will be scattered all over the earth.'</p><p>
"Then my father spoke with me for a long time, agitated. He was not surprised by the actions of the sphere or by the fact that one of God's hypostases—its chief hypostasis, perhaps—had appeared before Anastasia in the image of a child.</p><p>
"My father was a priest, and no ordinary priest. He could extract the main point from what he saw, and he was utterly uninterested in the vision itself.</p><p>
"The main thing was the thought that appeared in the dimension.</p><p>
"The thought produced by Anastasia has not been heard since the time of creation and has not been reflected in a single treatise. Extremely simple and at the same time supremely unusual, it transformed the known treatises into naïve fabrications that have nothing in common with the Divine essence. Anastasia brought into humanity's consciousness the concept of God that man lacked."</p><p>
"What does it consist of?"</p><p>

</p><p>
"You know that the Earth and everything that grows and lives on it, and all its processes—the rain, the snow, and the wind—were conceived of by Him in the beginning.</p><p>
"Our Creator—the Great Intellect—created his great creation in a surge of inspiration. To complete it, He was able to create man in His likeness.</p><p>
"But since the creation, doubts have never quit many essences as to whether man truly was created by God, as the unsurpassed creation in the Universe. Does God's assertion that man is not the same as many essences but is equal to God correspond to reality? As God Himself said, 'He is my image and likeness, I have given him everything, and in the future I will also give him what I have contemplated.'</p><p>
"God wanted to see His creation, man, akin to Himself.</p><p>
"Now look at present-day humanity. Many talk about God. They talk about the strength of their love for the Creator and at the same time they are lying to themselves. For you cannot love someone without seeing Him, without feeling and understanding Him.</p><p>
"Many say, 'I believe in God.' But in what specifically do they believe? Do they believe that God exists? But this is the level of a very primitive consciousness. The person who says, 'I believe that God exists,' is basically admitting that he does not feel or understand God but merely believes in His existence.</p><p>
"If by faith in God they mean that God is omnipotent, a good and loving parent, then what are they doing for God other than uttering words? They destroy His creations, seclude themselves from the world created by their Father behind the stone walls of monasteries. They have concocted and scribbled out thousands of treatises, but everywhere it's the same thing. The treatises say that God must be worshipped. People pray to no one knows whom.</p><p>
"Now, Vladimir, imagine the state of God looking upon this whole bacchanalia. You can if you try. After all, God possesses all the feelings of man, only they are stronger in Him, more acute and pure.</p><p>
"Even with our present-day feelings as human beings and parents, however, we can picture the state of our Parent, our Creator.</p><p>
"Here He is looking at His children, and they do nothing but clamor, 'We love You. Just give us more of Your mercy. We are Your slaves, feeble and slow-witted, foolish. Help us, Lord.'</p><p>
"Can God-like creations really behave in this way? What could cause more pain to a parent than his children's helpless groans? Consequently, doubts appeared in the universal essences as to the perfection of God's creations."</p><p>
"But who was able to dupe man like that? How and when?"</p><p>
"Man could be duped only by someone equal to him in the power of his thought: man himself.</p><p>
"The priests sent people down the path of degradation. They endeavored to prove to God that they were capable of controlling all humanity and that the human groans and agonies would force God to enter into a dialog with them.</p><p>
"They believed this because they knew that God never spoke to anyone, never interfered in human destinies, and all destinies were determined by one's own choice of path.</p><p>
"But if humanity were brought to the brink of ruin, God might negotiate with those leading humanity toward the abyss in order to avert a fall, with those who influenced the human psyche. They acted in this way for the sake of all humanity.</p><p>
"Millennia passed, but God did not enter into a dialog with the priests or produce new miracles in order to make all people see the light. First my father and then I myself have understood why.</p><p>
"Had He done this, had God interfered in human life, then He Himself would have confirmed the conjectures of the universal essences: that man is imperfect.</p><p>
"Most of all, His interference would have killed off man's belief in himself. Man would have completely ceased to discover in himself the Divine principles, relying exclusively on help from without.</p><p>
"So He waited, and He believed in His children. He looked upon what was happening and what they suffered. He endured the ridicule and curses against Himself. He believed in His creation, man. His belief truly was Divine belief.</p><p>
"The priests hoped that the denouement might come moments before the wide-scale disaster. They hoped that what they had conceived of would come to pass. None of them expected that just one person, a young woman, would in a few years destroy their plans, their millennial efforts, and turn humanity toward the Divine primary sources.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"Anastasia effected this about-face. She showed the Universe the power of God's creation, Divine wisdom. And perhaps for the first time—just think of this, Vladimir, picture the magnificence, the significance of the event—for the first time since the moment of earthly creation, our Father heard words about the perfection of His creation.</p><p>
"The beautiful future modeled by Anastasia already lives in the dimension. With each moment, it is being made concrete by many people, who are beginning to understand their own essence and purpose, so that the materialization will inevitably come."</p><p>
"But when will it come? The priests could act and prevent it, too."</p><p>
"But not the high priests. Now it is essential to overcome the program created by the priests. Before departing, my father spoke with one of them. The priests never meet. They reside at different ends of the world, but they can communicate at a distance, sensing each other's thoughts.</p><p>
"My father was standing on a small hill. The dawn ray was already slipping over the cedar treetops, lighting up my father's countenance and figure. I heard a soundless dialog in the dimension:</p><p>
"'I am Moses, descendant of that dynasty which has controlled the fates of nations for thousands of years. I am their descendant and their forefather. I am ordering, not asking, you who count themselves high: do not waste your efforts opposing Anastasia.</p><p>
"'All my granddaughter's efforts are not consistent with our thoughts and plans. Her inconsistencies are to my liking and my soul's. I am Moses. I am a priest. We are equal in power, and I will shield my granddaughter.'</p><p>
"The high priest replied, 'Yes, Moses, we are equal to you in power. So I know you are not expecting me to renounce my attacks, but to advise.</p><p>
"'I am he who is now thinking about how to help her and how to halt the monstrosity of the system. We have created a monster, and it is more powerful than we are. You, too, took part in its creation, after all.</p><p>
"'It has been consuming its children and hacking up human bodies for more than a thousand years. Now it will take centuries of our efforts to stop it.'</p><p>
"'But your granddaughter's thought is more rapid than ours. In a year, she creates a millennium. None of us now is capable of helping or harming.</p><p>
"'The sole thing of which I am certain is that we must create our own way of life according to the image sketched out by your granddaughter.</p><p>
"'We must invest all knowledge into our co-creation, becoming a strong example for people.'</p><p>
"The priests spoke sparely among themselves, but what was said by many had meaning."</p><p>
"I do not think everyone will understand the priests' dialog. For instance, it's not clear to me what this beast consuming its children is, and why, while wishing to help Anastasia, both your father and the high priest, nevertheless, say that they are incapable of giving her help."</p><p>
"It's all a matter of speed of thinking, Vladimir."</p><p>
"Speed? But why is that so important? Where is the connection?"</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0710>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>10. Speed of Thinking</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
"We now know that man's distinguishing trait from everything else that grows and lives on earth is the ability to think, but even in embryo, both animals and plants have thought. Man surpasses all the others by the speed of his thinking.</p><p>
"Originally, man's speed of thought was much closer to God's, and given a certain way of life it could increase and surpass God's. At least, that is what Our Parent wanted.</p><p>
"If the speed of man's thought had reached God's, then man could have produced a vital, harmonious world on other planets.</p><p>
"The significance of the speed of thought is the greatest secret kept by the priests. They have tried by all possible means to eliminate even oblique references to the speed of thinking.</p><p>
"You may have heard expressions like 'slow-witted' and 'slow on the uptake.' What do they speak to? They speak to the fact that it is hard or boring to talk with someone whose thought works more slowly.</p><p>
"The speed of thinking differs among all the people living on earth, but the differences can be insignificant or significant. With the help of a significant superiority in speed of thinking, one person can subdue many, even entire nations.</p><p>
"Imagine giving a million people an arithmetic problem. First to solve the problem is the person who thinks faster than the others. He can solve the problem ten, twenty, or thirty seconds, or a minute, or ten minutes before the others. This simple example speaks to the fact that one person finds out the answer ten minutes before the others. Ten minutes before the other nine hundred ninety-nine people. He finds out something new and obtains knowledge faster.</p><p>
"Arithmetic yields a seemingly trivial example. However, now picture the people of the whole earth being given a problem that takes a thousand years to solve. They start trying to solve it. One person thinks three times faster than the others. Consequently, he alone will know all of humanity's intermediate actions before the others.</p><p>
"What humanity will solve in nine hundred years, he will solve in three hundred. Consequently, for six hundred years he can control and direct the actions of everybody else. He can suggest a correct intermediate solution to someone, bringing him closer to the result; he can give a false intermediate solution to someone, thereby setting him back. Or, what is easier for him, he can give everyone a false solution, lead them into a dead-end, and then make the discovery before everyone—in other words, wield power.</p><p>
"Seven thousand years ago, the priests realized the possibilities opening up before the person who thought that much more quickly than others. They set themselves the goal of increasing the disparity several fold. Using special exercises, they tried to increase their speed of thought in comparison with others', but could not at first achieve a significant disparity. Consequently, they came up with a system that slows the movement of thought in every person born. They perfected the system, still in use, over more than a millennium.</p><p>
"Look closely at the way most modern people live. Analyze it, and you will see that most of it aims to stop the movement of their thought.</p><p>
"Anastasia began to reveal to people the secrets of the priests. She told them how even a small child should not be torn away from his preoccupations, since this means stopping the movement of his thought.</p><p>
"Then she showed you several exercises aimed at accelerating a child's thinking. She told you how the beginning of teaching for us consists of correctly posing the question to the child.</p><p>
"When a child is asked a question, his thought begins to look for an answer and thereby tries to go faster and faster. In this way, his speed of thought increases by the minute, and by age eleven it will surpass by many times the rate of thought in a person shaped by a system that slows it down.</p><p>
"Look at what is happening in the modern world. The child is surrounded by artificial objects from infancy. Any object is the embodiment of someone's thought, and so someone's thought—as primitive as a rattle, for example—is offered up to the infant. The toddler is given a doll or a mechanical toy car. Children like to play, and their play largely depends on what they're brought.</p><p>
"You must look closely at the difference, Vladimir. When your daughter was a baby, she shook her rattle and examined her doll.</p><p>
"Your son, born of Anastasia, likes to play, too, like all children. But his toys were a squirrel, a she-wolf, a bear cub, a snake, and much else created by God.</p><p>
"Now compare, only you must picture the degree of difference in the speed of thinking between the person who created the rattle or doll for your child and He who created the squirrel.</p><p>
"In this way, one child comes in contact with an object that contains a primitive thought, the other with an object created by God. The rate of thought in the two children, each interacting with such different objects, is going to differ strikingly. Which child will have greater speed, you can guess for yourself.</p><p>
"When your children begin to talk, you determine how much they can and cannot do. The child is basically instilled with the idea that he should not think for himself, that everything has already been decided for him. Consequently, he doesn't need to think, but to follow someone else's thoughts.</p><p>
"When the child goes to school, his teacher who stands in front explains to him the essence of things, the rules of conduct, and the way the world works. He not only explains, but he demands that the child think the way someone else thought he should. And once again he thereby slows the development of his speed of thought. Speaking more precisely, he prohibits the child from thinking independently.</p><p>
"Your school lacks the most important subject, the purpose of which is to increase speed of thinking. This main subject has been replaced with many others, whose purpose is to reduce the speed of thought the child already has."</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0711>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>11. Thought Training</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Listening to her grandfather's story, I realized that Anastasia, too, interacting with her son, constantly set up activities for him to increase his speed of thinking. Outwardly, this looked like play, but his thought was still being trained even when the child, apparently just playing, seemed to be developing only his physical abilities.</p><p>
I have already recounted how one morning, playing chase with a she-wolf, Anastasia performed the following stunt. She summoned the she-wolf and quickly ran away from it. The she-wolf ran after her. But when it had nearly caught up, Anastasia suddenly took a running jump at the trunk of the closest cedar, pushed off with her feet, did a somersault, and ran in the opposite direction, while the she-wolf ran past out of inertia.</p><p>
I saw my son running after the wolf cub, too. The young wolf would catch up to the child, no matter how hard he tried to run.</p><p>
Running slightly ahead, the wolf would turn around and cleverly manage to lick the running child quickly on his foot or hand. Volodya would stop immediately and catch his breath for a bit. Then he would once again try to run away from the wolf, and once again the animal would catch up.</p><p>
When Anastasia showed her son the trick of jumping against the cedar trunk and abruptly changing direction, the child liked this exercise very much and tried to repeat it. He took a running jump at a cedar tree, feet first, but he just couldn't do a somersault and immediately run in the opposite direction. The first time he pushed off the tree trunk, Volodya fell on all fours. After plopping down at the second attempt as well, he looked questioningly at his mother.</p><p>
Anastasia told him, "Volodya, before jumping at the tree, you first have to mentally picture your further actions."</p><p>
"I did, Mama. I saw how you did it."</p><p>
"You saw how my body did it, but you didn't picture or feel how yours should act and what to obey. You first have to train your thought."</p><p>
How one could do physical exercise mentally was absolutely incomprehensible. However, the child went up to the tree trunk and stood near it for a while, first closing his eyes, then making involuntary movements with his arms and legs. Then he walked away and ran quickly toward the cedar trunk.</p><p>
He ran faster than usual. I even got scared. What if something didn't work out for him? What if he hit the tree trunk and injured himself? But he did it. He pushed off, did a somersault, and after tottering slightly on landing, was able to run back immediately. Volodya did this exercise a few times, and each time he got better and better technically.</p><p>
"A good exercise," I thought.</p><p>
"It develops all the muscles," I said to Anastasia.</p><p>
"Yes," she replied. "It develops the muscles, but above all, it accelerates thought."</p><p>
I didn't ask then how a purely physical exercise could accelerate thought, but soon after I realized that Anastasia had set exactly this goal by showing the child her trick. Here is what happened.</p><p>
Volodya called to his playmate—the wolf—and they ran off. The wolf had nearly caught up with Volodya when he made a running jump in the opposite direction. Not anticipating such a move, the animal rushed past the cedar.</p><p>
While the wolf was coming to a stop and figuring out what had happened, Volodya was already running swiftly and happily in the opposite direction. He was laughing, waving his arms, skipping, feeling like a conqueror.</p><p>
However, the young wolf turned out to be an unusually smart and clever competitor. When Volodya had done the same thing for the fifth time, as his racing friend approached the cedar trunk the wolf suddenly slowed down and stopped, not running all the way to the tree trunk.</p><p>
When Volodya did his somersault, intending to run in the other direction, the wolf deftly licked him as he landed, hopped in place, and waved its tail. Now it was the wolf celebrating, and Volodya looked at it in amazement and dismay.</p><p>
Anastasia and I were sitting not far away and watching this scene. Volodya tried once more to outwit the animal the same way, but once again he got caught. The clever wolf stopped in advance each time, and calmly waiting for the child to land, and licked him—and more than once.</p><p>
Volodya got to thinking. His face became serious. Even his eyebrows shifted, but obviously he hadn't come up with anything. Thoughtful, he came to us with a question in his eyes. Anastasia said immediately, "Now, Volodya, you must consider take not only your own thought, but the wolf's as well."</p><p>
And my son walked off again to think. I began contemplating the situation, too, and I arrived at the firm conviction that if the wolf understood my son's maneuver, then there was nothing to be done for it. The wolf predicted Volodya's actions, and as long as the child did them, the wolf would just wait for him. Even if Volodya did his trick twice as fast, the wolf would still be able to lick him, and no thought here would help.</p><p>
When I saw from the face of my son as he approached us that he had come to the same conclusion, I said to Anastasia, "Why torture the child? It's clear that now he can't run away from the wolf. And you can't either. Your she-wolf did not catch on to this when you were running away from it, but this young wolf has proved smarter than its mother."</p><p>
"Yes, the cub is smarter than the she-wolf, but man must always be smarter. I'm not torturing the child. I suggested that he think, take into consideration the wolf's thought, and come up with his own solution."</p><p>
"Clearly, there is no solution whatsoever. If there is one, then show me. I can't look at my son's sad face."</p><p>
Anastasia stood up and gestured to the young wolf to come to her. It immediately ran up to her, delighted, wagging its tail. Anastasia patted its withers, made a beckoning gesture, and ran off.</p><p>
My son and I watched Anastasia running swiftly and easily. The amazingly light and free movements of this grown woman and mother struck me with their beauty and swiftness.</p><p>
Nonetheless, the young wolf's running was a little faster. Anastasia veered away from it a few times, abruptly changing direction. The animal lagged behind a little, but soon after it once again almost caught up to her.</p><p>
It was clear that eventually he would reach her.</p><p>
Suddenly, Anastasia ran swiftly straight toward the cedar Volodya had been pushing off of. A few meters before the cedar, the wolf slowed its running, and when Anastasia took a jump, it crouched, preparing to lick her foot or hand the moment she landed. But . . .</p><p>
When she jumped, she didn't push off from the cedar. Her body passed a centimeter away from the tree trunk. Anastasia kept running, getting farther from the cedar, while the stunned wolf still sat at the ready, trying to figure out what had happened.</p><p>
Volodya jumped in place, clapping, and he began speaking happily. "I see, Papa, I see. You have to think fast both for yourself and for the wolf. To think quickly for yourself and faster than the wolf thinks—I see how this is done."</p><p>
When Anastasia came up, he told her, too:</p><p>
"Thank you, Mama. It will never catch me again."</p><p>
Volodya ran away from the wolf, first weaving, like Anastasia, but then he did a whole cascade of all kinds of tricks: first he grabbed the trunk of a small tree and with its help changed direction faster than the animal chasing him, then, leaping over a thick branch snapped off by the wind, running up to it a second time, he simply jumped up, while the wolf took a fast leap forward.</p><p>
This is just one example of a great many. But most important is not the number of examples but the understanding of the problem's essence.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0712>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>12. The Most Forbidden Topic</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
"The system dumps on both grownup people and children streams of news that are supposedly important, but whose purpose in fact is mainly to distract people from the news.</p><p>
"For example, you see reports on television about how one official met another official or one ruler met another ruler. Their meetings are presented as newsworthy, but if you give it some thought, you realize there is absolutely nothing newsworthy in this.</p><p>
"Officials have been meeting for millennia. They meet every hour. Negotiations have been under way between rulers of different countries for millennia. But nothing, absolutely nothing significant changes because of these negotiations.</p><p>
"It doesn't change because they never talk about the main thing. They never talk about the true reason for war. They talk only about the result.</p><p>
"But they lead you astray in offering up each meeting as news.</p><p>
"Notice that the most forbidden information in the whole world is the topic of humanity's path of development.</p><p>
"Can you picture airplane passengers utterly indifferent to where the plane is going or whether it might land?</p><p>
"You thought there were no such passengers. Everyone has an idea beforehand of how long the plane will be in flight and the city where it is supposed to land. But ask one, two, or a thousand people living on planet Earth, ask a million, and no one will tell you what humanity is striving toward.</p><p>
"The system created by the priests has blocked human thought.</p><p>
"Modern man, atrophied in his thinking, is in no condition not only to determine the correct path of development for all humanity or of an individual state, but he is in no condition to model even his own life.</p><p>
"All the leaders you know on earth do not in fact control anything — that is, anything at all important. In no country in the world will you see a clearly laid-out plan for the state's development. It cannot be done without determining clearly and precisely the path of development of all humanity of planet Earth.</p><p>
"As a result of the priests' simple scheme in constructing their system, all rulers are overseers of the continued functioning of the priests' system.</p><p>
"All rulers are concerned with the so-called development of scientific and technical progress in their countries, with their military might, and with the retention of their own power.</p><p>
"For the sake of this, they ignore clean air and water not only in their own countries, but also in all other countries in the world. The system created by the priests looms over rulers. Like most people living on earth, rulers are active cogs in this system. Their thought has been slowed just as much as everyone else's.</p><p>
"Speed of thought! Oh, how I wish you or one of the people reading your books not only realized with cold intellect but also felt with every cell of his body how important the speed of thought is for the whole Universe.</p><p>
"It's not easy to choose the appropriate words and cite the examples essential for understanding. Examples! Anastasia compared the modern computer with a brain prosthetic. Consequently, a thought prosthetic. Those people who know the properties of a computer well will probably not only understand but also sense faster than others the significance of the speed of thinking. After all, Vladimir, you can work on a computer, too. Maybe through the computer you can present more rapidly the catastrophic nature of the consequences of slowing human thinking.</p><p>
"Any person familiar with computers knows that the size of the memory and the speed of its operation has great significance. Note: speed of operation.</p><p>
"Now picture what might happen if you were to slow the speed of a computer controlling a flying airplane or monitoring the operations of a nuclear system. The computer might allow a dangerous situation to arise and a disaster to occur.</p><p>
"The living biological computer that each person born on earth possesses is incomparably more perfect than a manmade one. It is called upon to help govern an immeasurably more perfect and extensive mechanism—the universal planets.</p><p>
"Control is possible if its speed comes close to the original speed or is increased. However, it has decreased and continues to do so. Each person can see this for himself by looking at the situation a little more closely.</p><p>
"If even the most perfect manmade computer uploads all possible information every day, every hour—it doesn't matter what kind of information, just so it uploads it—it will ultimately work more slowly, and it may also not be able to accept incoming information.</p><p>
"Something like this has happened to most people. The system created by the priests has been so overloaded, it has gone out of control. It has begun to operate of its own accord.</p><p>
"The story about the beast eating its children referred to a system gone out of control. Look more closely. Who takes a child born of an earthly woman-mother immediately into its tenacious paws? The system.</p><p>
"Who determines what kind of food the child gets? The system.</p><p>
"Who determines what kind of air the child will breathe and what kind of water he will drink? The system.</p><p>
"Who determines his choice of a life path? The system.</p><p>
"The priests are losing control over the earthly community's way of life, but they know the laws by which the system operates, and they can still influence the life of the planet. Even today, they can slow or activate the development of individual situations.</p><p>
"When the first book of Anastasia's statements came out, the priests took an interest in it. Of course they did! After all, these statements were coming from the mouth of a priest's granddaughter who was familiar with the secret levers of control—a young woman at that, and one leading a way of life that allowed her to accelerate the working of her thought.</p><p>
"They realized that Anastasia had set herself the task of carrying people across the dark forces' span of time. Theoretically, such a thing is possible. Carrying across time is a change of consciousness. Such a thing can be done with a single person.</p><p>
"Significant change in human consciousness is a process extended over millennia in which many generations take part, but a process stretched out over millennia cannot be called carrying people across a span of time.</p><p>
"Carrying people across a span of time means altering the consciousness of people living today, to the consciousness that they had or will be given on condition of a Divine heavenly existence.</p><p>
"The priests tried to determine the plan according to which Anastasia would act. They considered it naïve and full of many incorrect conclusions. They considered the means of conveying information only through a book obviously insufficient. To take in information, modern man requires many repetitions.</p><p>
"They also found out that the book's author was an entrepreneur with not only minimal authority among spiritually thinking people but someone totally unknown in those circles.</p><p>
"Consequently, the Siberian hermit would not be able to create anything significant in the human community by the path she chose, the priests decided. This included my father, who thought the same.</p><p>
"The priests' first amazement and caution arose when the events predicted in the first book started to take place.</p><p>
"She said, 'I will bring you many people who will explain the inexplicable to you'—and people started coming to you who not only could explain something. People began to act.</p><p>
"She said, "'Artists will draw pictures, and poets will compose poems'—and pictures and poems appeared about the new and beautiful reality of human existence.</p><p>
"She said, "'The book you write will be published in different countries'—and the book came out in many languages.</p><p>
"The priests did not know what force was helping her, what mechanisms were bringing what Anastasia had outlined come to pass, and come to pass in front of everyone.</p><p>
"They realized she was beginning to bring to life what she had contemplated, but they could not figure out how she was reaching the goals she had set.</p><p>
"This could mean just one thing: the speed of Anastasia's thinking significantly exceeded the priests' speed of thinking. The complex combinations of moves set up by her thought were unfathomable. This meant that the priests might have lost for good their opportunity to influence the human community.</p><p>
"The priests could not allow such a thing to happen.</p><p>
"While they were trying to come up with sets of counteractions, something even more incredible came to light. Her new statements were disseminated. Many people began striving to create the homesteads she had talked about.</p><p>
"At that point, all means of opposition were aimed at Anastasia. One of the most effective was disinformation with the help of the magic word-symbol 'sect.'</p><p>
"Articles appeared in your press that talked about different terrible sects and claimed that among them was the 'Anastasia' sect; they also used such word-symbols as 'totalitarian' and 'destructive.'</p><p>
"This means of counteraction had been used by the priests from the earliest times. With its help, they changed the religion in ancient Russia, too.</p><p>
"This means had always worked reliably. This time, too, the priests believed, it was working again. You and many readers, communicating among themselves but not knowing each other, were amazed to discover themselves being called sectarians.</p><p>
"False rumors were spread adeptly and intensively. Because of this, the government administration could not decide the issue.</p><p>
"The initiative to obtain land in order to set up homesteads was given open and tacit opposition. The system was working.</p><p>
"Priests of a lower chain believed that it was all over for Anastasia. First to understand that this was not so was the high priest. He realized that Anastasia's thought, having modeled the future, had not only taken into consideration the system's opposition but had redirected it for the good.</p><p>
"What happened was the following. Homesteads founded on the principles stated by Anastasia could not be created in the traditional way. A detailed plan for their construction was essential. A long-term program had to be developed, and some would have to labor over it for at least a year, some significantly longer. If the actions were not well thought out, that could lead to the ideas' discreditation.</p><p>
"But having slowed the process of obtaining land, they thereby averted any hastiness of actions.</p><p>
"By slowing the process of obtaining land, they were unable to destroy the dream of the future, to slow the work of the thoughts of many people shaping the image of the future of their homestead, the future of their country, and the beautiful future of all humanity.</p><p>
"Speaking of Russia's primacy in building the beautiful future, Anastasia understood well that a paradise cannot be created in a single homestead or even state by itself, and her dream was taken to heart by more and more people from other countries. Vladimir, you can determine this from the fact of the popularity of your books published in those countries. Their popularity today is great, but it is incomparable with their future popularity. When people start realizing. . . .</p><p>
"Now the priests have understood this. Anastasia is beginning to solve mysteries whose solution they have struggled over for more than a thousand years. Here is one of them."</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0713>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>13. Divine Nourishment</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
"In a conversation with my father, the high priest said, 'Moses, your great-granddaughter knows mysteries of existences unknown to us. She knows the mysteries of nourishment for the flesh and spirit. You yourself, of course, defined this according to her words: 'Nourish yourself the way you breathe.' Our ancestors read these words on the walls of their secret temples. We lent them significance, but the mystery had not been revealed to this day. By revealing it to the people who will be creating their own homesteads, she would thereby create conditions under which their speed of thought would exceed ours. We would appear before the children born on her homesteads like nothing but silly little boys. Having laid out her combination, she has shown us the solution: each of us must build the kind of homestead she told all people about. We will try to build them, and we will try to make them better, more perfect than others. We possess great resources for this.</p><p>
</p><p>"She is opening up the mysteries of existence to all, and we will learn about them, already having our own homesteads while others will just be starting to create them. Once again, the difference in speed of thought will allow us to predict, and consequently control, the life of the planet. That is what I thought, and I want to hear your opinion of this idea, Moses."</p><p>
"My father answered, 'You want to hear my opinion because you have doubts. Do you want to predict the situation Anastasia will model in the event that the priests and you, who call yourself the high priest, are the first to create homesteads that brings you closer to Divine existence? Do you want to know whether her thought has taken such a situation into account?'</p><p>
"'I'm convinced it has,' the high priest responded. 'She doesn't even try to hide the fact that it has. But I want to hear your opinion. Why is she openly provoking us by presenting once again the possibility of restoring our power over the world?'</p><p>
"My father said, 'It's all because my great-granddaughter Anastasia does not plan to fight you. When the priests—the earthly rulers—begin creating their own homesteads, their intentions will change. Their souls will shine with light.'"</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"'Thank you, Moses! Our thoughts are as one, and I rejoice in the awareness that we can look forward to living in a different reality, perhaps where each person can speak with God.</p><p>
"'I bow to your great-granddaughter's thought, Moses. May Anastasia find the strength in herself to vanquish the system we created like a fierce animal or many animals. You must help her if you can, Moses!'</p><p>
"'You must try to help her yourself. I cannot keep up with her young thought. I had not reckoned with analogous actions.'</p><p>
"'Nor will I keep up, Moses. She nourishes herself as she breathes. We are polluting our flesh. I am not strong enough to nourish my spirit the way she does. I can only conjecture what helps her.'"</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"The way of life of the people of the primary sources differed from life now. They did not simply know nature, they controlled it. Through the sounds of nature and the power of the light of the heavenly bodies, they were able to access the information base of the Universe. They received information through their feelings as well as their intellect. The speed of their thought surpassed that of the present day many times over.</p><p>
"The earlier priesthood understood that their absolute power over humanity was possible only if they could think significantly faster than other people. How were they to bring that about? One of the ancient priests, in a secret dialog with the high priest, said, 'We cannot accelerate our thought to sufficient superiority over other people, but we can use special means to slow the thought of all humanity.'</p><p>
"'You said "all humanity," so does that mean your own as well?' the high priest responded.</p><p>
"'Yes, ultimately, my own, too, but to a significantly lesser extent. The difference will be enormous. We will have the advantage on our side.'</p><p>
"'If you've talked about this, that means you have found a way to slow the thought of all humanity. Tell me about it.'</p><p>
"'It's simple. We must hide from people the Divine method of nourishment, force them to use food that slows rather than accelerates thought. This is the main condition. A chain reaction will follow. The degradation in thinking will bring with it many other factors affecting the speed of thought. Compared to us, all people will be inferior.'</p><p>
"'How can we hide what God gives to each person?'</p><p>
"'Declare the necessity of thanking God for what has been given.'</p><p>
"'I see. You have thought up something monstrous but unsurpassed. People will agree to thank the Creator and will not see anything bad in that. We will come up with rituals that distract people from God's immediate creations.</p><p>
"'They will believe they are thanking God, but the more time they spend giving thanks, gathering around the statues we put up, the less they will interact with God's creations and the more they will distance themselves from information coming directly from God.</p><p>
"'They will receive information coming from us, but think that God wanted it that way. Their thought will follow a false path. We will lead them down a false path.'"</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"Centuries passed, and people spent more and more time on these rituals the priests came up with, thinking that in doing so they were giving God their due respect. In truth, people were interacting less and less with the Creator's immediate creations, and consequently they could not take in the fullness of universal information. His information. They caused God pain and suffering, but they believed they were bringing Him joy.</p><p>
"Meanwhile, the priests began telling people what kind of food they should give preference to. In doing so, they created a secret science of nourishment. The priests needed this in order to maintain their own brain, spirit, physical condition, and consequently, their thought, in better working condition than others'.</p><p>
"Thus, they suggested to people that they sow certain plants but nourished themselves on others, or rather, on a greater variety than everyone else. Human consciousness underwent a monstrous degradation.</p><p>
"Man came to know diseases of the flesh and spirit. Intuitively, people sensed the importance of nourishment and over the course of millennia tried to sort out this issue.</p><p>
"Sages appeared who tried to give advice about which foods were most beneficial.</p><p>
"Many teachings on nourishment began to appear. Even books you know, the Bible and Quran, did not skirt this issue. Here, for example, is what the Old Testament says about nourishment:</p><p>
Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.</p><p>
These are the beasts which you shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, the hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois. And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat. Nevertheless these ye shall not eat . . . the camel, and the hare, and the coney, . . . they are unclean unto you. And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat: and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you. Of all clean birds ye shall eat. But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, and the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind, and every raven after his kind, and the owl, and the nighthawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, the little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, and the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you, they shall not be eaten. But of all clean fowls ye may eat. Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shall give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates that he may eat it or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God (Deuteronomy 14: 3-21).</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"Over the course of millennia, various books were written advising people on what food to use and how to use it in order to stay healthy. But not one book, not one sage, not all the scholars put together ever did manage to shed light on this issue in all its fullness. Proof of this is the increase in diseases of the human flesh and spirit.</p><p>
"Many books began to appear on how to cure diseases. Even today there is a science for this: medicine. They tell you that it is constantly improving. Simultaneously, however, you can observe that the number of sick people has grown.</p><p>
"So what is medical science improving? The result speaks for itself: it is improving diseases.</p><p>
"I see that this conclusion seems strange to you, but think about it yourself. Why do so many animals in natural conditions not get sick, while man, who considers himself a highly developed being, cannot seem to deal with his own ailments?</p><p>
"Your science, called upon to cure, in the entire time of its existence has never once touched upon the primary cause of all diseases. It has always paid attention to the consequence. Those who fall ill do need doctors, of course, but in the modern world order, doctors need sick people to no less an extent.</p><p>
"Further, the speed of thought of the priests themselves has decreased. Although not to the same degree as for everyone else, nonetheless, it has decreased. This phenomenon more than all the rest has disturbed the priests. They devoted more and more attention to the mysteries of Divine nourishment but could not unlock them.</p><p>
"One of the priests who was assigned to study the science of nourishment may have understood something and written it on the wall of a secret underground chamber where no one but the few main priests could enter. He wrote: 'Nourish yourself the way you breathe.'</p><p>
"Having written the last letter of this sentence, or rather, having not quite finished the last letter, the old priest died. He never did explain this sentence to his heir and successor or to any of the other priests.</p><p>
"The priests intensified their effort into uncovering the secret of 'Nourish yourself the way you breathe' for all the succeeding millennia. They feared someone else might hear about this phrase and unlock its mystery before them.</p><p>
"They wiped it off and chipped it out of the wall of their temple. But they passed it down orally to the generations of their successors, hoping for a solution in the future—but in vain.</p><p>
"Astrologers, healers, and sages attached to the rulers studied the problem of nourishment for millennia. No one was able to discover the answer.</p><p>
"If any of the rulers' sages were able to understand how man should nourish himself, then the rulers, who considered themselves the most powerful in the world, would cease to fall ill and their longevity would increase.</p><p>
"If any of the earthly rulers knew the food he needed to eat, he could become the sole autocratic ruler on earth. He could surpass the priests' speed of thought.</p><p>
"But all rulers of the earth fall ill and die. Their longevity is no greater than ordinary people's, even though they have the best healers and sages by their side.</p><p>
"The degradation of the human community continues.</p><p>
"Anastasia said this phrase to you seemingly in passing: 'Nourish yourself the way you breathe.' You published it in a book. You published it in its immediate context and lent it no wider significance.</p><p>
"But for the priests living today as well, the dissemination of this phrase, wiped from the walls of their temple more than five thousand years ago, became grounds for the most intense agitation.</p><p>
"Many times they have reread the books with Anastasia's statements, and they have realized that she not only knew this phrase but also fully possessed knowledge of Divine nourishment.</p><p>
"Anyone possessing such knowledge, naturally, would significantly outrace the thought of all the priests put together and consequently would be capable of controlling all humanity, including the priests. However, in order to control them, the information must be hidden, and she, on the contrary, reveals it to everyone. Consequently, she is liberating people from the priests' influence, and furthermore is bringing people directly into contact with God's thoughts.</p><p>
"They realized this when they saw Anastasia scatter among her phrases information about Adam's nourishment. In your book Co-Creation, you cited Anastasia on how the people of the primary sources nourished themselves:</p><p>
"Around him were many different-tasting fruits, berries, and herbs good for eating. But Adam did not feel hunger in the first days. He was full from the air.</p><p>
"Man truly cannot feed on the air he breathes now. Today the air has been deadened and is often toxic to the flesh and soul. You referred to the saying that you can't be full from air, but there is another: 'I fed on air alone." It corresponds to what man was presented with in the beginning. Adam was born in a beautiful garden, and in the surrounding air there was not a single harmful speck of pollen. In that air, the pollen was dissolved and there were drops of the purest dew."</p><p>
"Pollen? What kind?"</p><p>
"Flower and grass pollen, pollen shed from the trees and fruits of the ether—those nearby and others from faraway places brought on the wind. At that time, the problems of finding food never distracted man from his great works. Everything around fed him through the air. The Creator made this all so from the beginning, that everything living on Earth in a surge of love strove to serve man; the air, water, and breeze were life-giving."</p><p>
"Of course, the ration of nourishment for the people of the Divine primary sources included not only life-giving air, they consumed much else, too, but air and water fed their flesh and soul to a significant degree.</p><p>
"You wrote down Anastasia's words about nourishment, and the priests turned cold from shock. How could this extremely simple truth not have occurred to them? Immediately, they realized why it couldn't have.</p><p>
"Isolated in their temples, they couldn't breathe air saturated with pollen. Assembling people for rituals, where the crowd raised only dust, they breathed the dust of their own fabrications.</p><p>
"The priests understood the significance of nourishment. Their ration included infusions of many healing herbs and various vegetables and fruits. Among everything else, they ascribed greatest importance to cedar oil, which their servants obtained for them from distant places. Their ration also always included honey and the flower pollen that bees gather. But Anastasia showed that this was infinitely lacking. This was a different pollen. The pollen collected by bees and stuffed into honeycombs did, of course, bring quite a bit of benefit, but it was significantly different from the diversity to be found in the air of one's home dimension.</p><p>
"After all, bees gather pollen from a relatively small number of flowers. And in the air there is all the diversity, and its softness and speed of assimilation makes it different from bees'.</p><p>
"The pollen in the air is living and capable of fertilization. With each breath man took, it entered him and dissolved, nourishing his flesh and his brain.</p><p>
"When the priests saw that Anastasia was talking about homesteads, about a hectare of one's own land for each family, they realized that she was returning people to the way of life of the primary sources.</p><p>
"They immediately realized that homesteads could not only bring people material well-being, but more importantly, in the context stipulated by Anastasia, people could shape a dimension which could nourish their flesh, soul, and spirit. All people could see in reality the truths of the Divine universe.</p><p>
"A situation is maturing in which humanity might end up simultaneously in two worlds. It will have the opportunity to enjoy both the achievements of the technocratic, artificial world and the Divine primary sources. Comparing the two worlds not from hearsay, and taking advantage of the opportunity to judge for themselves, from their own condition, people can make their own choice or create a new world—their own beautiful Divine future.</p><p>
"Anastasia showed people not only the meaning and essence of Divine nourishment, but also how to arrive at it. Her homesteads. . . .</p><p>
"Imagine, Vladimir, it's morning. A man wakes at dawn and walks out of his house into the garden of his homestead, where more than three hundred varieties of plants necessary to him grow.</p><p>
"He has developed the habit every morning of taking a turn around his holdings.</p><p>
"He walks down the path, and his eye is delighted by the lively diversity of herbs, trees, and flowers. It has to delight him, give him positive emotions.</p><p>
"Nothing can give a greater emotional charge or more energy than a living dimension of one's own.</p><p>
"Many centuries have passed. In each century, humanity has attempted to extract every possible kind of treasure.</p><p>
"Man delighted in a big house, new clothing, a new car, or some other thing. Man delighted in money and his position in society. Yet all these joys are relative and transient. They bring pleasure and joy only at first. After a short span of time, they become ordinary and begin to bring bother and sometimes even irritation.</p><p>
"A house aging and falling apart by the minute begins to need repairs. A car breaks down. Clothing wears out.</p><p>
"Man intuitively always sensed the true beauty and perfection of the eternal, and so even a tsar surrounded by luxury and possessing palaces always needed a garden. This is the truth, which has remained unshakable for the millions of years man has lived on earth.</p><p>
"True enjoyment and conciliation is to be had only on one's own homestead.</p><p>
"The man walks in the morning through his homestead, and each blade of grass rejoices in him and reacts to the man.</p><p>
"His garden does not fall apart, but grows with each minute of its God-given life.</p><p>
"He understands that the program given him—the trees, bushes, and berry plants selected and planted by his hand—are not going to be destroyed but will live through the ages. They might live forever if he does not contemplate something else.</p><p>
"He walks in the morning through his homestead, breathes its air, and with each breath small, invisible particles enter into him, the plants' pollen. The air is saturated with it, and this living pollen enters and dissolves in him completely, nourishing his flesh with everything essential. The air of the homestead nourishes not only human flesh. It nourishes the spirit with ethers and accelerates thought.</p><p>
"He walks in the morning through his homestead and suddenly stops, picks three berries from a currant bush, and eats them. Why has he stopped at a currant bush precisely? Why has he picked three berries precisely? In what wise book did the man read that this morning in particular he needed these three berries?</p><p>
"He truly did need them. He needed them that day, that minute, and in that exact quantity.</p><p>
"Then he took a few more steps, leaned over, and sniffed a flower. Why? Who told him of the need to breathe in the ether-aroma of this particular flower?</p><p>
"He walked a little farther and picked . . .</p><p>
"He walked in the morning through his homestead, smiled, thought his own thoughts, and at the same time was being satiated with its fruits without thinking about them. Instead, he sensed them. The man was nourishing himself the way he breathed.</p><p>
</p><p>"So who calculated with incredible accuracy man's nourishment for him? Where did he write down all the information for each person born on earth?</p><p>
"For all this information—believe it, Vladimir, and understand it—all this information is contained in every person. Look.</p><p>
"In every person there is a mechanism—I couldn't choose another word. In every person there is a mechanism capable of giving rise to hunger, which signals that the flesh or spirit needs something from universal substances. We won't say what exactly, in what proportions, in what quantities; no one can determine such a thing intellectually. Your body alone knows about this and chooses among the diversity just three currant berries.</p><p>
"However, in order to give it the chance to choose correctly, your organism must know all the information about them, and only a homestead can furnish it with that kind of information.</p><p>
"Imagine: you go into a store where many fruits are set out on counters. You want an apple. You see many types of apples. Which of them will you choose? But a precise choice is impossible. After all, your body, which is capable of making a precise choice, has no information about the apples on the counters. It hasn't tried them. It doesn't know their flavor or balance of substances. It doesn't know when they were picked, and that is very important, too.</p><p>
"As a result, the apples you acquire may seem healthful, but they will not benefit you as much as when your body knows precisely all the information about the food that you have made it digest.</p><p>
"The food you make it take in might also turn out to be harmful, with disease as a result. Such a thing is impossible on a homestead. After all, you know exactly which of the apple trees growing in your orchard the one you pick comes from—the sourer or sweeter apples—and when it is ready for you. Your organism receives information about all the fruits of your homestead.</p><p>
"It received all the information about them back when you lay in your mother's womb, and later, when you drank milk from her breast. After all, your mother enjoyed those same fruits, which helped form her milk.</p><p>
"Now the man is already grown. . .</p><p>
</p><p>"He was walking in the dimension of his homestead, tasting its fruits and berries—everything that had comprised his mother's milk.</p><p>
"You also have the concept of fresh foods being healthy nourishment. But what are fresh foods?</p><p>
"Not frozen, not dried, not in cans or sealed containers, as you thought, but those that are in their natural form. You have cultivated many hybrids, types that can be kept for many days and seem fresh. They are harmful because of their deceit of freshness, believe me.</p><p>
"Now you must know this, and you can verify what I've said yourself.</p><p>
"Nearly all berries can be considered fresh for just a few minutes. The fruits of the sweet cherry tree, the sour cherry tree, the apple tree—no more than an hour. They change with each passing minute into something else.</p><p>
"Just pick a sour cherry and let it lie around for one night. Then go to the tree with it and eat it and immediately try another from a branch. You will taste the difference, even with your eyes shut, which cherry is fresher and tastier.</p><p>
"You can tell changes in a raspberry after an hour, and in some after twenty-four hours. You will see and understand that whoever does not have a homestead, no matter how powerful and rich he is, cannot eat fresh food, and as a result cannot think quickly.</p><p>
"In the ancient treatises, sages also attempted to set forth their ideas about which season is most beneficial for eating which food. This is very important, too. Meanwhile, however, among the many, only one tenet is firm: the one that God created for every person.</p><p>
"Look for yourself how, gradually, starting in spring, the early plants yield fruits, followed by others in the early and late summer. In the fall it is time for others.</p><p>
"What is there to write here when it is blatantly clear what must be eaten and when. And not based on the month or season. Suggestions are given for each minute. Just think about it, Vladimir, and understand. Our Creator is prepared to practically spoon-feed everyone by His own hand.</p><p>
"Just think how perfect and precise His program is.</p><p>
"There is a season when a fruit ripens. The planets fall into a precise order at that time, the one most favorable for man to pick the fruit.</p><p>
"And just at the appropriate moment, marked out by God, man picked the fruit because his organism suddenly wanted it, without any calculation whatsoever. He did not trouble himself with the problem of when to nourish himself or with what. He simply ate. He ate because he wanted to, and simultaneously his thought was carried away over joint creation.</p><p>
"It rushed ahead, no longer engaged with what the Father had thought through, and wanted to create more, to the delight of everyone who contemplated the new creation.</p><p>
"And God rejoiced: 'My son is a creator,' and he fed His child with His creations."</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0714>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>14. A Society of Schizophrenics?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Listening to Anastasia's grandfather's story about how man should nourish himself, I could not help but compare this with the nourishment of the modern man, even the rich man living in a so-called civilized country. A highly puzzling situation arose. Let us try to sort it out together.</p><p>
We all know that it is healthful for man to nourish himself with fresh, organic foods.</p><p>
We all know that there are plants which can heal any ailments of the human flesh. Stop. Here I must say this more precisely: There exist in nature plants capable of preventing illnesses of the human flesh. So why don't we use them? Why, under whose influence, do we choose a way of life that destroys our flesh and intellect? Someone must simply be mocking us, forcing us to call this way of life "civilized" as well.</p><p>
</p><p>If we use the terms "civilized country" and "civilized state," meaning by this a community of people who have achieved a definite and, of course, correct level of development, then this development should be reflected in matters of nourishment not only as well, but first and foremost.</p><p>
Now let's visit a supermarket Russian style—a store of a modern "civilized" state. Those who have not been in Western countries may visit ours. In the big cities, the assortment of goods among them does not differ very much.</p><p>
We will see that most foods are handsomely packaged and have a long shelf life. We will see many dried, frozen, and concentrated foods. This entire assortment cannot be called fresh food.</p><p>
Also in the supermarket we can see vegetables labeled "fresh"—tomatoes, cucumbers, and so on—pretty to look at. But now it has become well known that these are hybrids, specially cultivated to preserve a good appearance for a long time, while significantly losing out in quality to normal, natural fruit.</p><p>
In European countries, nearly every adult knows this. There, a network of stores has appeared whose signs say that the goods offered there are organic, whose cost is approximately five times higher than in ordinary stores. Consequently, society has recognized that in the conventional stores, many more in number, the foods are not organic.</p><p>
Now let's call things by their proper names. Society has recognized that most people eat foods that harm health.</p><p>
Stop! How, then, can we call ours a "civilized state"? Can people of a "civilized state" really consume poor-quality food harmful to their health?</p><p>
A more accurate name for a state like this is an "imbecile state" or "a state with a duped population."</p><p>
In the "imbecile states," which Russia, too, is trying so hard to resemble, a precise system for duping the population has been carefully articulated.</p><p>
Look at what is happening. Man tries to nourish himself with poor-quality foods and becomes ill.</p><p>
He then falls into the hands of the system called "health care." This system has at its disposal a huge number of medicines, hospitals, and research centers. It is a paid system. An enormous amount of money circulates in it.</p><p>
We are told that it is constantly improving.</p><p>
Pay attention, though: according to statistics, every year the number of sick people grows. Moreover, new illnesses are appearing that have never been encountered previously. Many new psychiatric illnesses have appeared, and there is now a fashionable profession, the psychotherapist.</p><p>
It is reasonable to ask why the population's health has deteriorated in "civilized states." Doesn't health care itself play a role in this deterioration?</p><p>
That man's health has deteriorated there is a fact that every person who so desires can be convinced of if he compares data from different sources.</p><p>
We are talking about not only his physical state but an even more dangerous factor, his psyche.</p><p>
One has only to break away from the incessant, monotonous news, which keeps us from thinking seriously about the essence of what is going on, and one can, to put it mildly, doubt the normality of the majority of the population in so-called civilized countries.</p><p>
One can view the way of life chosen by society as a symptom of schizophrenic illness. Judge for yourself.</p><p>
For example, a man living on his own homestead wants to eat an apple. What does he do? He goes out into the garden, picks a fresh fruit, and eats it. Now look at the actions of someone else living in a city apartment in a developed state. He too wants to eat an apple. The man takes his money, goes to the store, and buys an apple, but it is no longer fresh. Someone else grew that apple then packed it in a container. Someone else transported this apple in a truck or on a plane. Then someone else built a store and put this apple on his counter. All the operations, from cultivation to sale, are recorded, accounts are kept, and taxes, duties, and other fees are levied.</p><p>
In this way, a whole chain is set in motion in which people supposedly engage in business. They give people like themselves the chance to taste the fruit of an apple tree. Furthermore, before the person tastes this fruit and satisfies this need, he has to work somewhere to get the paper money that pays the entire artificial chain that stands between the branch of the apple tree and the consumer.</p><p>
And society considers this a normal phenomenon. It does not suspect that someone wanted very much to lead people away from their true purpose and force them to engage in something senseless.</p><p>
People were led toward this absurdity gradually. It couldn't be done quickly. If it had been done quickly, then even a slow-witted person could have seen the delirium of what was going on.</p><p>
You just have to picture the paradoxical nature of the situation. One fine day, you decided to go to your apple tree, as usual, and pick a fruit. You took a step from your front porch toward the apple tree and saw a rank of people.</p><p>
"Who are you?" you asked the person standing closest to you.</p><p>
"I'm an apple seller," the man replied.</p><p>
"And who are those people behind you?" You stood there amazed and heard in reply:</p><p>
"Behind me stands the person who brings the apples to my store, and behind him is the person who harvest them from the tree, and around each of us you see people in nice suits. These are the people who record how many apples go through us."</p><p>
"Have you gone off your rocker, guys?" you protest. "Why are you doing these pointless things? Who will thank you for this senseless work?"</p><p>
He replies, "You will thank us. You are going to pay us all money, and with this money we will buy apples for ourselves, too."</p><p>
"Where am I going to get so much money?"</p><p>
"You go to your neighbor, to the pear tree; there's an opening for a clerk there. You'll be a clerk and earn the money you'll pay us to eat apples when you want."</p><p>
Total absurdity, you're going to say. Schizophrenia. Of course it's absurd, of course it's schizophrenia. But something similar has already happened to us.</p><p>
The most obvious conditions for a healthy life should be set forth in the form of a treatise. So here it is, a small treatise.</p><p>
First</p><p>
Each person must have his own homestead, his own dimension, in order to provide high-quality nourishment.</p><p>
Second</p><p>
In his own dimension, a person must cultivate plants, preferably by his own hand, that bear fruit, those plants which he believes he will find delicious and healthful. If, for example, the person knows beforehand that he doesn't like red currants, then he should not plant them in great quantities. In all, no more than three hundred types of perennial plants should be planted on a homestead. I will not repeat myself on the unusual ways of planting and interacting with the plants; I described them back in the first book, when Anastasia was talking about summer people. Of course, such a thing cannot be brought about in a single year, but, say, in two or three. It is entirely possible, however, that the truly ideal source of nourishment will be left for your children.</p><p>
Third</p><p>
A person must wake up every morning and take a walk through the plot of his homestead, and if the desire arises, eat a fruit, or berry, or herb that has ripened at that moment. This should be done exclusively by desire, and not at the recommendation of some nutritionist, even one with an academic degree. Once your body has come to know all the tastes of what grows on your homestead, it itself will compile the ideal diet for you in the quality, quantity, and season for partaking of nourishment. You must go out on your homestead not only in the morning or at hours strictly determined by someone else for taking nourishment, but when you get the urge to eat.</p><p>
Under modern conditions, many people cannot live permanently on their homestead, even if they have one, but they should visit it at least once a week.</p><p>
In the event of illness, before taking medicines, best of all is simply to go for a few days to your native dimension and spend time there.</p><p>
If you have already shaped your own homestead, if your body has the information about the plants that grow in this dimension, it will with absolute precision be able to choose for itself what is essential for recovery.</p><p>
Anastasia has asserted that there is no human illness that cannot be vanquished by a dimension of Love you have created.</p><p>
Of course, here she means not the dimension of a city apartment, but a homestead set up according to the principles she has set forth.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
I formulated these rules in my notebook, read them out to Anastasia's grandfather, and asked, "Have I left anything out?"</p><p>
He replied, "If it's to be short, this will do for a beginning. But you absolutely must say something about neighbors."</p><p>
"What do neighbors have to do with this?" I didn’t understand at first.</p><p>
"What do you mean?" her grandfather was amazed at my question. "Think for yourself. If right over the fence of your homestead a factory is emitting lethal cinders and gases and the wind brings these ashes onto your homestead, what will you be breathing?"</p><p>
"No one is going to build a homestead next to a factory," I objected and fell silent.</p><p>
I remembered. In Novosibirsk, summer people had plots just five hundred meters from a tin refinery, and in Germany there were farmlands next to eight-lane highways.</p><p>
I thought that such a simple concept as cultivating agricultural produce for man's nourishment is possible only in an ecologically clean location, preferably not near big cities. This simple concept just can't seem to get through to man. Truly, I need to write one more point.</p><p>
Fourth</p><p>
Your homestead must be located in an ecologically clean zone. It must be surrounded by the homesteads of like-minded people in the creation of native heavenly oases. Life-giving pollen from your homestead will be carried away by the breeze to your neighbors, but another breeze will carry life-giving air from them to you.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0715>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>15. Opposition</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Many readers of the "Ringing Cedars of Russia" book series have been convinced that there is opposition to a harmonious and physically and spiritually healthy way of life.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
I have written several times about reports I've received alleging that the Russian Orthodox Church has come out against Anastasia and that clerics have helped spread rumors in administrative bodies that all readers of the "Ringing Cedars of Russia" series are sectarians.</p><p>
At first, I couldn't believe that these reports were serious. Soon after, however, members of the Novosibirsk readers club told me that church representatives had gone to the directors of the House of Culture and asked them to stop a readers' conference.</p><p>
Later they showed me how, on one Orthodox website, a person calling himself a "doctor of theology" abused Anastasia in every possible way, using far from theological expressions. Readers entered into a polemic with him and tried to explain that Anastasia's ideas are positive. But the "doctor of theology" probably was incapable of discussing this topic; he was much more interested in a discussion of whether my name was real or a literary pseudonym.</p><p>
Later people began sending in newspapers articles from the regions that seemed to have been written with carbon paper. From their manner of exposition, standard expressions, and malicious fabrications, it was easy to determine that the basic authorship stemmed from the same source.</p><p>
Finally, a completely extraordinary fact—Vstrecha, a St. Petersburg theater, put on a show called "Anastasia" based on themes from the "Ringing Cedars of Russia" books. On July 23, 2002, the theater troupe arrived in Vladimir and performed the show in the Taneyev Concert Hall.</p><p>
On July 25, they took the show to Tula. The previous day, the local paper ran as its lead article an appeal over the signature of the missionary office of the Tula diocese calling on people not to attend the performance and also talking about how the books and play advocated a return to paganism.</p><p>
In general, they were trying to frighten people. Nonetheless, the performance played before a full house, but when the Vstrecha Theater director brought me this publication, I, as well as others who saw it immediately had identical questions for the Tula diocese missionary office.</p><p>
How could you criticize a show you hadn't seen? The only performance was in Vladimir just two days ago. Tula was basically the premiere.</p><p>
In St. Petersburg, clerics had come to the show and later thanked the actors for their highly spiritual performance. They said, "We wish there were more like this!"</p><p>
This suggests that a certain force opposing Anastasia keeps close watch on spiritual phenomena like her. One can find this force both in Russia and beyond its borders, and it possesses a network capable of reacting to processes taking place among the human masses, to develop or slow them at its discretion.</p><p>
The stories about priests from Anastasia, her grandfather, and her great-grandfather thus assume increasingly real and specific outlines, which have been expressed in specific actions of the present day.</p><p>
Her grandfather said that the high priest, who shapes the ideology of entire nations, refused to oppose Anastasia, but that the system the priests created would oppose it for centuries. This, too, found its confirmation.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
Locally, these zealous opponents proved incapable of penetrating the essence of what was going on. They acted as if according to a previously installed program and unfairly accused Anastasia of actions completely uncharacteristic of her. For example, when asked, "Should everyone go to the forest?" Anastasia replies, "You shouldn't go to the forest. First clean up the place you have littered."</p><p>
However, parts of the press have alleged that Anastasia has called on people to abandon their urban housing and children and go to the forest.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
In this way, one can conclude that certain structures are actively attempting to prevent the advancement of Anastasia's ideas—specifically, the allocation to each Russian family of a hectare of land for setting up their homestead.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
Of course, Anastasia's opponents try not to mention this basic idea and prefer to frighten people with their fabrications.</p><p>
Of course, I wanted to defend both the idea itself and the books' readers from slander and other obstacles to their goal. To defend them. But how and from whom specifically? After all, even slanderers have specific names, employers, and interests, of course. However, there is an analytical center of supporters of Anastasia's ideas. Far from all the people who belong to it are known to me personally, but their determinations and conclusions are quite interesting. For example:</p><p>
"Opposition is being rendered not directly at Anastasia but at the national idea that has been born in Russia. The opposition is stemming from a single intermediate point. As if on signal, it is picked up locally by adepts not in contact with each other. These adepts are to be found in diverse social strata, including the church.</p><p>
"The method is primitive: slander and the spread of obviously false rumors. If necessary, provocation by means of heading up the movement and discrediting it."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
The analytical center has identified by name and reported who specifically stole the computer with the manuscript and how they planned to hijack the website. Who attempted to replace Anastasia's books with frauds seemingly similar but in fact gradually leading away from her ideas and how?</p><p>
I was also told the same forces had used the same means as they had against Anastasia to persecute the school of Academician Shchetinin and the singer Baskov, a pleasant young man with a powerful and beautiful voice.. "What does Baskov have to do with this?" the reader wonders. This is exactly what drives them mad. Imagine this young Russian suddenly beginning to sing:</p><p>
Dawns shining on the ringing cedar's branches.</p><p>
Generations of the virtuous land cast their beam.</p><p>
Dawning heavens give the land a sigh of love.</p><p>
And interplanetary winds caress sleep with reeds</p><p>
In each grain is power conceived</p><p>
In each child a mission arises.</p><p>
In a white beam Russia is revived,</p><p>
Anastasia, Russia, God have mercy.</p><p>
This song was sung by a children's chorus at the launch of the book, Who Are We? at the Oktyabrsky Concert Hall in St. Petersburg. You can hear this song sung by bards and in the video, "Bring Back Your Homeland, People," the latter written by a teacher from Belarus. It has apparently become a folk song. The singer Baskov may sing other patriotic songs about Russia, too, and they will call out to Russians. These are the Russian initiatives someone finds so terrible. A Russian revival.</p><p>
</p><p>They asked me not to worry, not to talk about what was going on, and assured me that for the first time the opportunity had arisen to study the mechanism and to name the specific people carrying out the ideological diversions against any positive trends in Russia.</p><p>
I wouldn't have said anything, either, and would have let the appropriate agencies deal with this. Forgive me, though, I cannot be silent about one thing, despite my promise. If I were to be silent, I would lose my self-respect for good.</p><p>
It is impossible to remain silent any longer about the attacks on the school of Academician Shchetinin and its teachers, and in general against innovative teachers, but above all, against the children.</p><p>
The pupils at Shchetinin's school, together with the teachers, decided to build one more school. In Belgorod Province. They began equipping the building presented to them with the agreement of a local organization. Accustomed to hard work and design and construction, they quickly achieved their set goal. They wanted other children to be able to study in a good school, but they had to leave the refurbished building. Why? Because the provocateurs do not nap.</p><p>
The exact same accusations were spewed out from the exact same point that organized the spread of the rumors about all the readers of the Anastasia books: "The Shchetinin school is a totalitarian sect."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
As in Anastasia's case, it was as if after a secret signal certain supposedly Orthodox priests began to parrot what had been said. And once again, using the same old phrases and groundless charges not confirmed by the facts.</p><p>
The pupils of Shchetinin's school, a certain Father Alexei writes, allegedly "have no experience whatsoever dealing with money." That's a lie—they do, but they're not obsessed with it the way you are.</p><p>
"Shchetinin's school uses the 'call to the circle' method, when the delinquent finds himself facing the entire group, which is negatively disposed toward him and expresses its censure."</p><p>
There's an accusation for you! Didn't the Cossacks call the delinquent "to the circle"? They did—not simply for censure, but for punishment with the lash. Don't our democratic and communist parties call their delinquents to their "circle"? Doesn't the Church call its delinquents to the "circle" and strip them of their rank? The church has done even worse—it's burned its dissenters at the bonfire. And here we have this reproach.</p><p>
Might whoever wrote about this as a negative fact have meant that the "circle" can comprise just his own person? But then this would not be a circle, it would truly be totalitarianism.</p><p>
Different articles have also contended that Shchetinin's school is protected by Cossacks and that one cannot always get onto the school grounds uninhibited.</p><p>
Gentlemen, many schools are guarded nowadays, though, and not only in our country. Furthermore, what business do you have at Shchetinin's school? Have some fear of God. Guard your health. After all, you're horrified when you see that the children of this school don't drink or smoke, that they build their new buildings themselves and study hard. Apparently, "grace descends" upon you when you find drugs and obscenities in the schools.</p><p>
I am not going to report all the nonsense written about this wonderful school. Even their colleagues have condemned these writers.</p><p>
Here is what Alexander Adamsky wrote in his article. I will cite an excerpt from it:</p><p>
On Saturday, the first of April, Author Television (ATV) broadcast a taped episode of "Press Club" devoted to what are now called diverse publications in the press about the school of Mikhail Petrovich Shchetinin in the village of Tekos in Krasnodar District. The producers of 'Press Club' decided to gather teachers and journalists writing on schools in order to discuss everything.</p><p>
Professionally and philosophically, Shchetinin's system, a unique phenomenon of contemporary education, has of course given rise to debates. However, the arguments of "pedagogical hit men" (Alexander Radov's expression) differ from the arguments of those debating Shchetinin over substance.</p><p>
Hit men don't argue; they seek to destroy.</p><p>
</p><p>As long as pedagogy has existed and thought about itself, since Socrates' day, the mob has beaten vivid teacher-philosophers for stirring up youth and teaching unconventional ideas.</p><p>
</p><p>So the latest attempt at a pogrom against Shchetinin is no accident. As Alexander Radov said at a "Press Club" session, if pogroms used to be organized by officials, these days this is done by perfectly nice journalists. Nice boys and girls, encountering something that does not fit their usual notions, something so unlike what, in their opinion, a school or a teacher should be or how a system of education should be arranged, turn out to be incapable of coexisting with this incomprehensible idea that does not fit into their consciousness. What I don't understand has no right to exist—that is their simple and murderous logic.</p><p>
This is the old world stirring up what was left on the bottom, the last thing, the thick sediment of totalitarianism, aggressive and unshakable in its hatred for anything other, or different, or unlike itself. The old world, which has no place for tolerance, where children have to be identical and teachers have to teach the same thing. The beginning of the "Press Club" discussion was revealing. One of the publishers of attacks against Shchetinin contended that he had grounds for his accusations but first wanted to hear the arguments in favor. It is striking how alive the Stalinist logic is, according to which any person first must be defended so that afterward his accusers can decide the degree of guilt. No one doubts the defendant's guilt. The question is how guilty and what punishment to mete out.</p><p>
</p><p>Arguing with the publishers is useless, and naming them would only be publicizing them and flattering their vanity, which is what they're after—to be noticed. They have to be suffered, understanding that the old, outlived world speaks through their lips, that slumbering ignorance and malice guides their hand. They themselves are largely not to blame for anything, the way a child who plays with matches and burns down his house is not to blame. But what is going to happen to the school and the future of our education?</p><p>
From our standpoint, Shchetinin has made the greatest educational discovery, which, of course, has gone unnoticed by his attackers. He has discovered a new content for education. On his pedagogical island, he has arranged life in such a way that this way of life has become the content of the education. Of course, there are curricula and school subjects. The children, for example, study math and biology, but this is material, while the content has been the way of life of Tekos: constructing buildings, gathering food, protecting their residences, art, interacting with each other. Also, everyone talks about how the children are different and have not just a different study rhythm, but also different spheres for the fullest discovery of their abilities. For now, only Shchetinin has been able to make it so that different children move in their studies at an exclusively individual tempo, though. Therefore, a Shchetinin pupil may be studying ninth-grade physics but university-level architecture. This is what continuous education is.</p><p>
Who has been able to do such a thing?</p><p>
This is hard to imagine, let alone invent and implement.</p><p>
Of course, Shchetinin is a genius. Of course, Mikhail Petrovich is an artist, a thinker, and an outstanding figure in our culture.</p><p>
However, because of exactly this, you are not going to put either him or his work into a box or cliché, whether laudatory or condemnatory. One can and must argue with Shchetinin. One can learn from him, and he simply must be praised because an artist cannot live without praise and recognition.</p><p>
Shchetinin must not be insulted, however.</p><p>
No one should be insulted, at all, and no one should be destroyed. Sooner or later, such efforts will prove embarrassing. It's only in a mob that people prove themselves by destroying someone else. In normal society, people prove themselves by demonstrating respect and love, for others as well as themselves.</p><p>
Yes, the ideological hit men have been condemned, but what is condemnation to them? For them, this is a reward. Their bosses compensate them for everything. They are going to try even harder, always unpunished. How can they be punished? People have simply expressed their opinion, or simply made a mistake. How can you punish someone for holding a mistaken opinion? But they didn't make a mistake. By calling the school a totalitarian sect, they were thereby pursuing a precise goal: distancing administrative bodies from support of this beautiful new initiative in Russia. All officials are not going to go there to sort out the true state of affairs, but they will certainly try to distance themselves from any contacts. What if there really is something amiss at the school? In this way, the school is defenseless, liable to be torn to pieces, and here the hit men will try their best to methodically aim their blows.</p><p>
What does this mean for us? After all, right before our eyes, more than three hundred Russian children, as well as their teachers, have been smeared with mud, had their reputations blackened, and been insulted for two years.</p><p>
I don't believe that Russians are doing this. It's not in the Russian character. Yet, this persecution is clear to all, high-ranking officials and ordinary people alike. We see obvious insults against and moral abuse of children. By whom?</p><p>
Let the Russian officers talk about this. But God forbid we should tell our grandchildren, "We lived at a time when the school of Academician Shchetinin still existed in Tekos, and three hundred children studied there, dreaming of a beautiful Russia."</p><p>
We should tell our grandchildren, who will live on Russian homesteads, "And here is the school you now attend with pleasure, and which began under us. We protected it."</p><p>
All that will come later.</p><p>
For now, Mikhail Petrovich, teachers of Tekos, teacher innovators! It is hard for you, of course, but you know full well that "we cannot reach the truth on our hands and knees." And the children of the school from Tekos! Forgive me, southern Russians, if I do not do everything I should be able to. But I will. And many other people will. How is it there now—warm, probably? If it’s warm, that’s good. May the sun shine on you more often and warm the dream each of you has.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
In hopes of receiving practical advice, I told Anastasia's grandfather of the situation that had come about. The old man stood there, leaning on his staff, which he had inherited from his father, and listened closely to my story. At the story's end and after my request for advice about how to act in the situation that had come about, the old man was silent for a while. His face was concentrated. Then he raised his head skyward and squinted, as if scanning the dimension, and began to speak.</p><p>
"It was unclear to anyone—me, my father, or the high priest—how my granddaughter Anastasia would reveal the mystery of mysteries and answer the question of why the earth had begun to rot. Man had allowed himself to produce sufferings, both corporeal and spiritual.</p><p>
"If the earliest civilizations were considered the most intelligent on earth, why didn't they preserve a happy way of life for their children?</p><p>
"Right now, everything can be returned to God's primordial world. It was unclear to anyone how to preserve it and keep from repeating the same old mistakes. Here, she alone created with her thought the inconceivable combination and immediately put it into practice. Answers will be given to all our questions.</p><p>
"Anastasia is compressing events that have been developing for millennia into a single century. She is repeating them. Right now each person is personally testing the history of the earth and your country. Each will evaluate, draw his conclusion, and write his conclusion down in his family book. Man will be able to know the events of millennia through himself, his feelings, and his soul.</p><p>
"Just as they are now slandering Anastasia, they slandered your ancestors in ancient Russia, when they destroyed their culture.</p><p>
"They called paganism and the Vedism of ancient Russia terrible barbarism and a colorless culture. How can people be allowed to feel and understand what in fact was there?</p><p>
"My granddaughter has shown through herself the aspirations of her Russian forefathers and is now taking the blows from the descendants of those who slandered them to the modern day, to our children and grandchildren.</p><p>
"It is as if this were a performance, a historical play, and she were offering all people living on earth today to choose a role for themselves and then to play their chosen role and watch the situation objectively. Even those who simply observe all that goes on will be playing the part of spectators, living through and assessing the drama, and they themselves will strive to act.</p><p>
"I’ve hurried. You wanted to hear an answer as to who was creating these insults and obstacles. I will answer. An answer is not hard for a priest.</p><p>
"People are trying to present obstacles to everyone who has understood and been inspired by the ideas voiced by my granddaughter Anastasia. But those are not simple people. They are biorobots, guided by a tiny sect that was born long ago, and not in Russia.</p><p>
"I have newspaper clippings, though, and there are the signatures of the people who wrote the articles, and one says specifically that the missionary office of the Tula diocese has come out against Anastasia. There are reports from people in various regions talking about the bad attitude of certain Christian parishes.”</p><p>
"Do they also have biorobots, as you put it, that are subordinate to some sect?"</p><p>
"Biorobots themselves do not know about their own subordination. They were simply preprogrammed long ago. However, this programming did not predict the appearance of Anastasia and so has malfunctioned badly. It has set itself on a course of destruction."</p><p>
"I can't wrap my mind around this. Where can I find confirmation?"</p><p>
"If you can't wrap your mind around it, then you can calmly use your logic, and each person capable of thought can search for proof in their own logic.”</p><p>
"Use logic?"</p><p>
"Yes. Simple facts well known to everyone. Just look at how you can reason basing yourself only on facts."</p><p>
"How?"</p><p>
"First define precisely for yourself what Anastasia has suggested that everyone do."</p><p>
"Well, she suggested that everyone take at least a hectare of land and set up a homestead on it for their family and future generations. As she says, if each family makes their own heavenly corner for themselves, then the whole earth will turn into a paradise. She also talked about how to plant edible plants to fight disease and about a healthy way of life, about childrearing, and about a protective attitude toward nature. She has said that God's thoughts are dissolved in nature. Basically, she has constructed a model by which Russia could become a flourishing country where happy families would live."</p><p>
"Talking about homesteads, Anastasia in fact revealed to people the greatest mystery of Divine being. She showed the path of man's return to paradise. You can understand this if you combine her statements scattered through the different books into one.</p><p>
"She revealed a secret that was kept for millennia by the dark forces. They destroyed everything that could help people find out about it.</p><p>
"In the second century of your era, as it’s called, the last book written in runic writing was destroyed. This book talked about the Divine way of life for man. It spoke of the possibility of mastering the Universe through the harmonious mastering first of a plot of one's own land, then of the entire planet called Earth.</p><p>
"Once man had perfectly mastered the Earth, the opportunity opened up for mastering other planets of the Universe. This method for mastering other planets is psychotelepathic, not technocratic."</p><p>
"But has none of the great sages really ever once spoken about the earth the way she has?"</p><p>
"You will not find the discovery Anastasia has made for people in a single one of the treatises we have now, Vladimir. Moreover, for six thousand years, people have been intensively led away from understanding the earth. They have been offered up other teachings and assured of their truth.</p><p>
"Man studies one teaching and quickly sees that there is no truth in it, so they offer up another right away. He studies the other, and a third. So life passes, but man has not understood the essence of life, even as he is dying.</p><p>
"Meanwhile, intuitively, man keeps being drawn to the land and its great knowledge. Realizing that they could not pull this longing of human souls out by the root, the forces of darkness decided to compromise it.</p><p>
"Basically, there have been many subterfuges through the ages, but in the last six thousand years no one has consciously concerned themselves with the earth."</p><p>
"Consciously, is this the way Anastasia speaks?"</p><p>
"Yes, the way she speaks and the way people understand her.</p><p>
"Anastasia has turned the entire human community onto a beautiful path. Now, no one will be able to impede her. Many people carry her dream in their hearts."</p><p>
"But they are blocking it by slandering Anastasia and her readers, after all. If they understood they wouldn't be able to stop her, they wouldn’t slander her."</p><p>
"Right now, Vladimir, through the efforts of those committing the slander, even higher priests try to prevent the beginning of a new era directly from Russia. A little later, in another country, they will present the idea in a distorted form and, through this sham, try to defame it.</p><p>
"Anastasia was able to predict all this in advance. And her move, which she had thought out in advance, struck the high priest. Anastasia realized that after she revealed the essence of man and earth, far from everyone would be able to restrain themselves from direct interaction with the earth. Haste could be harmful. After all, first it is essential to create one's dimension in one's thoughts.</p><p>
"In Russia, the slanderers are now setting up obstacles for people, but people haven't betrayed their dream and have not retreated from creating their own dimension with their thoughts.</p><p>
"Of course the system is powerful, but you can't accuse all people indiscriminately. The clergy have offered varied opinions of Anastasia."</p><p>
"I know that. Several times I've met priests who do understand and support Anastasia."</p><p>
"You and your readers must understand who today is hurt by the new information arising in Russia."</p><p>
"I don’t think that many countries which consider themselves developed would like to suddenly see another more developed country all of a sudden."</p><p>
"That's logical. But many people live in each country. Do you think they all follow closely and analyze events in Russia?"</p><p>
"Not everyone, naturally. But there are certain interested people."</p><p>
"What kind, for example?"</p><p>
"What kind? Well, for example, those corporations which sell medicines and supply them to Russia in large quantities. It would hurt them if Russians stopped being ill."</p><p>
"Also?"</p><p>
"Also . . . a great deal of food is supplied to us from abroad, and when Anastasia's plan comes to pass, Russia, on the contrary, will be supplying food to many countries. And it will be outstrip the competition.”</p><p>
"So you mean Anastasia's plan will not hurt the general populace of the different countries but rather a particular category of individuals, and they could be in any country, including Russia itself? Right?"</p><p>
"Yes. That's basically right."</p><p>
"Now, tell me, this category of individuals possessing large amounts of capital, can it have its own services following world development trends?"</p><p>
"Of course, all major companies have services like that. Otherwise they would go broke. Some educational institutions even train people like that."</p><p>
"Fine. This means major companies have services that study the development of their business in different countries, and they can influence the creation of favorable conditions for themselves."</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"You agree. Fine. So the further logical chain leads you to the fact that the governments of entire countries might possess similar services."</p><p>
"There are many historical examples of that. The most significant of all concerns a tiny Jewish group through whom they today control America, Europe, and Russia, although it is merely an instrument in the priest's hands."</p><p>
"What connection is there between the Christian dioceses coming out against Anastasia's ideas and this group?"</p><p>
"As I have said, these kinds of people are biorobots. They are shaped under the influence of the priests' program and spread by a tiny Jewish group."</p><p>
"Where can we find proofs for these assertions?"</p><p>
"In the facts of history. Take a close and unbiased look at them."</p><p>

</p><p>
In addressing Jews and Christians, I am hoping for understanding from at least some of the adherents of these two mutually exclusive ideologies. I understand that few are aware of the purpose that has compelled me to take up this topic.</p><p>
No sooner had I mentioned the topic of Jews and Christians in my previous book than certain insults followed.</p><p>
Although the essence of what Anastasia has said pursues just one thing—shedding light on the reasons for conflicts between peoples—conflicts that have not ceased for five millennia.</p><p>
When I was working on this book, common sense suggested it would be better not to touch upon Judaism or Christianity. Why irritate some readers and, moreover, set them against myself? Nonetheless, possessing definite information, I do not believe I have the right to conceal it, no matter how unpleasant it might seem to someone.</p><p>
Citing information about the Jewish pogroms that have gone on for more than a millennium, I mentioned just historical facts as best I could and tried not to comment on the circumstances described or give them a subjective assessment.</p><p>
My sole goal is to attempt to avert another large-scale pogrom against Jews in several countries at once.</p><p>
This pogrom could be significantly larger than the one inflicted during Hitler's Germany. It is almost inevitable. Only one thing can avert it: a sufficient degree of understanding of the causes of the previous pogroms and the corresponding actions to eliminate those causes.</p><p>
I will try not to resort to the statements of the Siberian taiga hermits—Anastasia, her grandfather, and her great-grandfather—although for me personally they take on more and more weight with each passing year.</p><p>
For others, they might seem like a mere fabrication. I will try to compile proof from all the known facts or from those whose existence each person can be convinced if he so desires.</p><p>
As we know from historical sources, the pogroms against Jews began in the times of the Egyptian pharaohs. During the last millennium, they recurred periodically, about once every hundred years. They arose in different countries, which had become Christian by that time. With each century, they became larger and larger in scale. The last large-scale action to destroy the Jews was committed by Hitler's Germany in the years 1939-1945. Jews were incinerated in concentration camp ovens, shot, and poisoned with gas. According to different sources, during this period about six million Jews were destroyed.</p><p>
The periodicity of repeating events connected with the destruction of Jews by peoples of various countries over the course of millennia now speaks clearly and convincingly to the existence of certain causes behind these events. However, someone is making painstaking efforts to mask the true causes.</p><p>
The media—the press, radio, and television—are trying not to touch upon this very hot topic. The mere hint of such a topic gives rise to accusations of inciting national hatred.</p><p>
In fact, inciting national hatred may in fact serve to hush up the acute issues that are disturbing society.</p><p>
The fact that the Jewish question disturbs society is attested to by numerous facts.</p><p>
Many know the public statement by a Russian general, a State Duma deputy, who declared from a rally dais, "Get all the Jews out of Russia."</p><p>
Several State Duma deputies condemned the general. The press, naturally, did not allow him to speak. No one entered into a polemic with him. Why? Perhaps this general is the only person in Russia who adheres to this opinion, so is it worth wasting precious air time for a debate between the entire society and one person?</p><p>
I dare say he is not alone. There are many anti-Semites among the generals, among the state officials, and among young people.</p><p>
The number of people who believe that all their misfortunes stem from the Jews mounts by the day. The press's silence makes it possible for a critical mass to accumulate. I will cite figures that attest to this more eloquently.</p><p>
Beginning in 1992, various publishers in Russia have published more than fifty books denouncing Jews. This rather serious number does not include the hundreds of self-published materials or the numerous newspapers and magazines.</p><p>
These publications don't lie on store shelves or collect dust in book warehouses. They are passed from hand to hand. Many of them literally wear out. There is a demand for these publications, and the fact that the press refuses to address an issue that agitates so many people leads those people to simply conclude that "the whole press is in the hands of the Jews." Their arguments are hard to refute for anyone unprepared to argue.</p><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
Two men and a young woman entered the train compartment in which I was returning from St. Petersburg to Moscow. The men were wearing dark shirts and wide officer belts. Evidently exhausted from stormy events, they lay down on the upper berths to relax.</p><p>
I struck up a conversation with the young woman, who was also dressed severely. It turned out that they were returning from a congress of "Russia's patriotic forces," as she put it.</p><p>
"What were the goals of your congress?" I asked the young woman.</p><p>
"The struggle with world Jewry," she replied proudly.</p><p>
"If you're in Russia, how can you fight with someone in Europe, for example, or America?"</p><p>
"We have supporters in both Europe and America. We have not made contact with everyone, but we know of many movements that share our views. Patriots of different countries will soon unite against world Jewry."</p><p>
The young woman spoke eloquently and boldly. Either she had memorized something or was inspired to perform the role of orator in what I’m sure was her own "patriotic" movement.</p><p>
I asked the young woman, "Have Jews ever harmed you personally in any way?"</p><p>
"Of course, they have. It's because of them that I've been forced to live in a poor and dirty country that grovels before the West and eats its scraps."</p><p>
"But why do you believe the Jews are the cause of the state's failures?"</p><p>
"Because the program of their actions is very particular. To deceive and rob one country, then another, and a third. As soon as the first gets back on its feet, they clean it out again. They don't consider us human beings. Here, read what's written here. These are a few quotations from their Talmud." She held out a slim brochure to me, having opened it to a specific place, and I began to read.</p><p>
I am not going to quote these because at that time I didn't know how well they corresponded to what the Talmud actually says. But I did know that according to the Old Testament, Jews are supposed to consider themselves the chosen people. The point lies elsewhere. Struck by the fervent aggressiveness of this youthful "patriot," I thought that eventually it would be necessary to look the truth in the eye.</p><p>
The causes of the incessant conflicts within many countries lie in the simultaneous existence of two mutually exclusive religion-ideologies.</p><p>
Let us think about what religion is. Above all, it is an ideology that shapes a specific type of person, instilling in him a specific program of action.</p><p>
A religion, in this case Judaism, defines its followers as the sole people chosen by God and regulates its actions with respect to those outside the faith.</p><p>
Christianity says that the Christian is a slave and only after death may he repose in heaven. It is hard for the rich to get to heaven. You must love your neighbor and share your property with him.</p><p>
The Talmud says, "Everything is yours"; the Bible," Give everything away." A good combination. These two mutually exclusive ideologies, as we know, stem from a single point, Israel, but this does not mean that their developers were in reality Jews. What is important is something else: the inevitability of conflict.</p><p>
The fact that the conflict between adherents of the two ideologies is inevitable can be well seen from the behavior of even small children. If we tell one child that all the toys he sees belong to him alone, and we tell another that he must give away the toys that belong to him when someone needs them, what is going to happen?</p><p>
The child may agree once or twice to give up his toys, but he is definitely not going to feel love for whoever takes them. Then he will want to get back at least something. He will extend his hand, but they will give him nothing. As a result, he'll start to cry or try to use force.</p><p>
The result is that with the help of two different ideologies, a conflict is predetermined even between children born in the future.</p><p>
In this case, nationality has absolutely no significance.</p><p>
If all Jews were made Christian, or all Slavic peoples Jews, the same conflicts would take place.</p><p>
It is not different nationalities that are constantly fighting each other but different ideologies that exploit nationality.</p><p>
We have had more than one occasion to hear from even cultured and educated people about the necessity of tolerance toward different confessions. The State Duma has passed a law punishing those who incite national and religious hatred. On television, we see the leaders of different religions attending government social events together.</p><p>
It all seems good, intelligent, and correct. However, extremism is not reduced by this in the least. They also show us mined posters that say "Beat them!," and we hear news reports about bombings of various organizations.</p><p>
So what is going on? It's all very simple. The situation cannot be changed with pretty words and appeals alone.</p><p>
Not only that, the situation is actually made worse and deftly masked by these words—masked so that at x-hour, the state can be blown up and destroyed.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"Let us treat all religious confessions with tolerance." Indeed. I, for example, like many people, am not opposed to a tolerant attitude.</p><p>
But what happens with the religious confessions themselves? Each of them tries as hard as it can to acquire as much power as it can as quickly as possible and attract as many supporters as it can to its side. As a result, once they believe they hold sufficiently solid positions, the two ideologies will inevitably enter into a struggle. The history of unending conflicts attests to this, but humanity, as if programmed, over the course of many centuries, continues step on the same rake.</p><p>
Did the priests, the creators of the two ideologies, know about this? Yes. Those capable of psychologically influencing millions of people in different countries could not help but know. Those capable of programming people.</p><p>
Did they really mean to make the Jewish people happy by speaking of their chosenness? History shows that their goal was completely different. Over the centuries, the Jewish people have been used as a token, a scapegoat, a shield that keeps people from noticing those who pursue their own dark goals, using both Jews and Christians as pawns in their uncomplicated game. This programming has brought both nothing but suffering.</p><p>
Judge for yourself what all this is leading to right now. Aggression is accruing throughout the world. The conflict between Israel and Palestine continues. Aided by the military equipment and support of the United States, Israel can occupy and force Palestinians to submit to their demands, But this will not lead at all to mutual respect between the two neighboring nations. Quite the contrary, the quantity of aggressive energy toward the Jews throughout the Muslim world is mounting drastically. This energy will have to manifest itself, up to and including terrorist acts in Israel and the United States, but this is not only a matter of the direct Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p><p>
The dead end this path of development for earthly civilization leads to has become increasingly obvious to many.</p><p>
AIDS, drug addiction, crime, and technogenic disasters are eating people up. The overwhelming majority of people on the planet lack the opportunity to eat food that does not harm their health, to drink clean rather than polluted water, and to breathe clean rather than toxic air.</p><p>
What if these masses get information about the true cause of social and technogenic disasters and leaders appear who point out to them the true perpetrators of the planetary situation and guess their game, their goals, and their purposes?</p><p>
This is exactly what world ideologies fear. So, trying not to allow the national fury to turn on them, they toss them the tried-and-true scapegoat, the Jews: it's all their fault; have at them. In their fury, the masses attack all Jews without distinction. This has happened many times throughout the ages. They attack them in the belief that they are eliminating evil, but in fact they are merely letting off steam.</p><p>

</p><p>
The story from Anastasia's grandfather struck me because its proofs were so unusual and simple.</p><p>
Subsequently I compared his conclusions with other sources and was struck by the degree of coincidence of facts that led logical thinking to specific conclusions. In my further exposition, I will try to compare the conclusions of Anastasia's grandfather to other sources.</p><p>
</p><p>In the years A.D. 30-100, tiny groups of believing Jews and infidels living both in Israel (Palestine) and inside the larger Roman Empire began to unite into an independent movement inside Judaism. A small Christian community arose made up of people who truly believed in Jesus Christ's precepts and in His speedy resurrection.</p><p>
Many historical monographs, including the Bible itself, confirm this.</p><p>
In short, the fact that the powerful Christian teaching began with meetings of a small Hebrew community has been confirmed.</p><p>
Now let us try to determine how the teaching of this small community suddenly took hold in the Roman Empire, present-day Europe and Russia.</p><p>
How did so many countries come to know about it at all? Even in Israel itself very few did.</p><p>
According to Anastasia's grandfather, the priests who guided the Jews of that era saw that with specific development, or rather a reworking of the Christian teaching, it could shape a slavish person easy to control. This type in part or almost entirely switches off his own logical thinking and begins to believe what clergymen or others tell him. More precisely, the priests created a human biorobot who obeyed the program installed in him.</p><p>
(A human biorobot is a person who has agreed, not quite voluntarily, of course, but under the influence of a special occult program, to believe in an unreal world. Since the unreal world is built by someone with a specific goal, this someone asserts he knows the laws of the unreal world and demands that others subordinate themselves to those laws. In fact, however, he makes others subordinate to him personally.)</p><p>
Further, the Judaic priests, who by that time possessed not only the knowledge but also the practical experience of introducing the types of teachings they needed in the masses, trained hundreds of preachers from among the Christians, supplied them with money, and sent them to different countries to introduce the teaching they needed.</p><p>
We find indirect proof of this in the following.</p><p>
Late in the second century of our era, Hebrew Christian communities suddenly unleashed the broadest missionary activity in different countries. This proselytizing was preceded by intensified evangelization (the publication and distribution of the Christian Hebrew Bible).</p><p>
Everyone knows full well that publishing books takes money even today. In times long past, the production of each book took not just money, but a lot of money. Journeys to other countries took quite a lot of money as well. Merchants or high-born, wealthy people could allow themselves these kinds of journeys.</p><p>
So how did a community that included primarily rural inhabitants carry off such a costly and large-scale operation?</p><p>
Of course, they received expert theoretical training and quite a lot of financing. The attention from the priesthood and the moral and material support turned the ordinary believing peasant into a fanatic.</p><p>
Just imagine an Israelite villager who is suddenly told, "We see a great missionary and preacher in you. Study up a little and you will get money and you will teach the people, but not in our country. You have to go to other countries."</p><p>
They studied, got the money, and went on their journeys. They journeyed to other countries. And what was the result? Did they achieve success? Not a bit. The population of all countries not only rejected the Jewish preachers, they first listened to them, then asked them to go away, beat those who were especially persistent, and set their dogs on them.</p><p>
Attesting to this are many facts in the history of the Roman Empire of that time, where most of the preachers were sent.</p><p>
The result of the widespread action was the organization in a number of places in the Roman Empire of a network of Christian communities, but they had no influence whatsoever on the foundations of the traditional religions.</p><p>
Ancient Rome had been and remained pagan. These sects had no influence whatsoever on imperial politics or on the formation of the new type, the slave biorobot the priests dreamed of.</p><p>
The first wave of preachers were not welcomed by Rome's emperors.</p><p>
The emperor Nero, complacent toward the different pagan religious beliefs, was hostile to the Christians alone. The Christians were driven out of those territories by the emperors Dionysus (249-251), Diocletian (284-285), and Galeria (305-311), one of their main persecutors.</p><p>
Success was achieved only by the second wave of preachers, who were no longer fanatics of the faith. The priests trained them in such a way that, on the one hand, they could speak eloquently about faith, and, on the other, they had the knowledge of psychologists capable of influencing a person by exploiting his aspirations for their own purposes.</p><p>
The task of this second wave involved influencing rulers exclusively. The ruler's conviction that if the Christian faith strengthened his power and make it permanent, the state would be wholly governable, controllable, and prosperous.</p><p>
It is to this end that the following doctrines were introduced: "All power comes from God," and "The ruler is God's deputy on earth."</p><p>
Confession allowed them to control the thoughts, hopes, and actions of each member of the country. In short, the preachers began to convince rulers that the Christianization of the state would create the optimal conditions for ruling.</p><p>
Outwardly, this appeared to be so, but only outwardly. Rulers who fell for these traps did not suspect that in essence they themselves were falling under the rule of other forces.</p><p>
The position of Christianity in the Roman Empire began to solidify significantly beginning in 312, when they were able to convince Emperor Constantine of the political benefit to him of allowing Christian churches in his state.</p><p>
Constantine agreed to give them protection, while still supporting the temples of the Roman gods.</p><p>
As a result, Christianity's position in the Roman Empire improved significantly, its wealth multiplied, and subsequent generations of Christian bishops acquired the might of Roman senators.</p><p>
This fact among many attests that this teaching could neither develop nor wield serious societal influence without the support of secular rulers. Society’s leaders themselves always strove for power.</p><p>
The power of the Roman Empire is great even today, even though there is no Roman Empire anymore. A coincidence? An exception to the rule or logical? The history of the states of succeeding ages, right up to the present day, can answer these questions.</p><p>
No one can name a single state that flourished with the advent of Christianity. On the contrary, one can cite several states overtaken by the same sad fate of the Roman Empire.</p><p>
One more interesting historical fact: in absolutely all countries that accepted Christianity, the Hebrews unleashed a highly odd activity. They became rich with unusual ease.</p><p>
Their activities in all Christian countries became so widespread that it could not go unnoticed by the populace or the governments of those countries.</p><p>
When it reached the tipping point in some country, people started attacking the Jews, and the government drove the Jews out of the country.</p><p>
Since the beginning of the second millennium of our era, there have been many pogroms against Jews in various Christian countries.</p><p>
Tens of Jewish communities were driven out and routed on the Rhine in 1096. In 1290, the Jews were driven out of England. In the late fourteenth century, more than 100,000 Jews were put to death in Spain. (It is true that after a while the Jews quietly returned to these countries.)</p><p>
This list of historical facts could be significantly increased, but what for? As it is, it is absolutely clear that situations so similar to each other and so repetitive over the course of many centuries are preprogrammed.</p><p>
Since representatives of the Christian world and the Jews themselves have been suffering the losses, then there is a third actor who is not. For this third party, Christian and Jew are nothing but biorobots that can be very easily manipulated.</p><p>
Who is this third party? Historians attempting to dig down to the essence, the roots of the bacchanalia that has continued for millennia always point to the Jews only.</p><p>
It's as if to say, it's all the fault of the Jews. But if there is a third force, then Jews as well as Christians are merely marionette biorobots in the hands of this third force.</p><p>
But can we define and prove its existence today? Of course, we can. Using what? Using historical facts and logical thinking. Judge for yourself.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
Among the Jewish class there is one clan, class, nationality, caste—call it what you like; the essence, after all, is not in the name—but for brevity's sake we will call them Levites.</p><p>
There are historical sources which say that the Levites' forefathers are the Egyptian priests. Relying on sources better known to many, specifically, the Old Testament, we can see that the Levites held a special position.</p><p>
For instance, according to the laws of Israel, they did not take part in military actions. They did not have to pay taxes or duties to anyone. During the census of the Israelite population that is mentioned in the Old Testament, the Levites were not subject to the census.</p><p>
When an encampment was set up during campaigns, the Israelite tribes, which numbered from fifty thousand to a hundred fifty thousand people, were situated along a circle. Each had a previously assigned place. It was decreed where they would place their camp on the south, north, west, or east of the main encampment and where to put the guard. The Levites always camped in the center. Thus, guarding the Levites was part of the duties of all the Israelite clans.</p><p>
What did the representatives of this class of Levites do?</p><p>
Their duties included appointing clergymen from their number and making sure that Jewish laws were observed. Moreover, these laws regulated what to eat, how to deal with infidels, and where to go.</p><p>
Jewish law strictly and in great detail regulated the entire waking day, from morning to night, and also indicated where and in what lands a person was supposed to live, and specified whom to fight.</p><p>
Thus, the Levites were basically the administrators of the Hebrew people—by all accounts, highly skilled administrators.</p><p>
It is hard to say whether the Levites themselves were Jews. Far from all the laws each Jew was supposed to uphold applied to the Levites. For instance, unlike the Jewish law mandate for all others, they were not subject to circumcision on the eighth day after birth.</p><p>
Thus, knowing the secret sciences of the Egyptian priests and having the opportunity to engage in experiments, observe, and contemplate, free from military duty and the ordinary jobs of everyone else, they could from generation to generation, down to the present day, perfect their knowledge.</p><p>
The phrase "down to the present day" might raise doubts in some, since we don't seem to have heard about a nationality or class called the Levites. The English, the Russians, and the French—many have heard of them—but for some reason, few know about the Levites, who supervise everything.</p><p>
Like the Egyptian priests, they have to stay in the shadows. If something happens, all the claims are made against the Jews, who carry out their will.</p><p>
This is why the Jews have been the subject of pogroms over millennia in different countries of the world. Why the pogroms? Because the Jews have tried by every possible means to acquire the most money they could. And many of them have succeeded.</p><p>
But what do the Levites have to do with this? What good or interest do they have if the Jews in England, Spain, or Russia carry out their own policy and transfer a substantial portion of state or private funds to their own bank? In short, pocket the money? The people and rulers of a given country will see unseemly actions, start beating up the Jews, and simply treat them badly. After all, this is the way to get to the Levites. In general, it might seem that there is no logic in the actions of the wise Levites and no reason for them to help the Jews with their wise advise or to figure out clever combinations for them, to manipulate entire states.</p><p>
It turns out there is reason: a direct, plain, and concrete interest. Money! Wealthy Jews, no matter what country they are in, are obliged to pay some of their profit to the Levites. Proof? If you please! According to the Old Testament, the people of Israel are supposed to give a tenth of their income to the Levites. The original says this:</p><p>
All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the Lord, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee. And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die. But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance. But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe. And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress. Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the Lord of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the Lord's heave offering to Aaron the priest. Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the Lord, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation (Numbers 18:19-31).</p><p>
Some may wonder what the Old Testament, more than two thousand years old, and the present day have to do with this? I have an answer for this. Are there not believing Jews, clergy, and rabbis today as well? Of course, there are! And, of course, most Jews observe the religious canons. Consequently, try to imagine the tremendous capital concentrated in the banks owned by the Levites in different countries.</p><p>
Moreover, they do not have to worry about the preservation and growth of their capital. Many bankers in different countries are Jews, and this is their task. At the necessary moment, the Levites may, of course, suggest where best to invest the money, which regimes or groups opposing an existing government to support or, just the opposite, destroy through financial intrigues.</p><p>
One might doubt Anastasia's information about how the entire human community is controlled by just a few priests, but now that the logical chain has been set forth, there can be no doubts for people still capable of thinking logically. Fanatics don't count here.</p><p>
The logic consists in the following.</p><p>
About a million Jews came out of Egypt under the priests' guidance. The priests' closest assistants are Levites, on whom is placed the task of shaping out of the Jews a specific type of human individual. An ideology specifically created for this purpose recommends a series of rituals and a unique way of life.</p><p>
The Levites have been able to carry out the assignment set for them. The ideology created a few thousand years ago governs the Jews today as well. It distinguishes them from people of many nationalities living on earth.</p><p>
One of the main postulates of this ideology is the assertion that God chose only the Jews, among the other nationalities populating the earth, as the chosen people.</p><p>
Consequently, even today the ideology exists, the Jews exist, and conflicts continue that many have heard of. But where are the Levites? Do we hear much about them? Practically nothing. Herein lies their cleverness or sagacity, you can call it what you like. But they exist.</p><p>
Now imagine that there is a small community which possesses more esoteric knowledge than anyone else and has acquired more and more experience over the millennia in effective influence on the masses.</p><p>
Can an institute of some state concerned with the problems of the country's development and shaping ideology compare with them?</p><p>
This is impossible for several reasons. The main ones are as follows.</p><p>
The Levites handed down to their descendants esoteric knowledge, and they continue to do so today.</p><p>
Modern science rejects esoteric knowledge. Consequently, few study esoterica seriously.</p><p>
This absurd situation is not accidental. Why absurd? Judge for yourself.</p><p>
On the one hand, the state officially recognizes some religions, and this too is complete esotericism. The state even creates advantageous conditions to help them thrive. On the other hand, the state has not supported its scientists to study esoteric trends. Consequently, structures capable of influencing the population's psyche have been legalized in that state. But a secular government has a very vague notion of how this influence expresses itself in real life. So who, then, is controlling whom?</p><p>
Second, a government and all the thoughtful people in a state can extract a lesson from history. History is a very good school, but people have to know history. Those who control the world know it very well. However, most people, including governments, don't know the history of their own state, except in distorted form. We can easily see this by the example of Russia.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
Quite recently in schools, institutions of higher education, art, and especially in literature, but everywhere in general, it was asserted that the life of our grandmothers and grandfathers in tsarist Russia was terrible. The majority firmly believed this. The majority not only believed it but even admired those who took us out of the horror of tsarism. Commissars in leather jackets were heroes and idols for many. Priests were the symbol of obscurantism.</p><p>
Suddenly, before our eyes—not in a few generations or centuries, you'll note, but right before our eyes—history changed.</p><p>
The commissars in leather jackets were thugs, it turns out, and they committed genocide against the nation. After tsarism, we lived in the most terrible, most totalitarian state in the world. Once again, the majority believed this, and once again the majority admired those who freed them from the yoke of the totalitarian state.</p><p>
I do not intend to assess which regime is better or worse. But I do wish we would all give thought to the phenomenon of change, the polar change in our consciousness over a very brief span of time. Why did it change in this way? Have the changes come about of their own accord or due to someone's influence?</p><p>
Here it is not hard to venture a guess: our consciousness has long been easily influenced, and it is being influenced today, too. We are guinea pigs in someone's hands.</p><p>
The masters of influence are vying with each other. They are making us incapable of accepting historical reality.</p><p>
Let us at least try, however, to find out what this reality in fact is. Let us try to define historical reality not from someone's words but through our own thoughts.</p><p>
Notice, we can see on daily television how widely men cheat on their wives and vice versa. They offer us so many unimportant problems to discuss, but God forbid any of the politicians, journalists, or writers should touch upon a serious topic. It may flash by and be lost immediately in the mash of gossip, cop shows, psychotropic advertising, and slander.</p><p>
There needs to be serious analysis of what we have lived through, a critical analysis of our present condition of life on the planet, and the development of a plan for the future. There needs to be a new ideology, one which unites entire nations rather than sets them at odds.</p><p>
You can say it is essential a thousand times. You can even shout it a thousand times, and it will not appear. If you gathered together all the leading scholars of the world and they sat down to work it out, nothing would come of it, either. There would be only endless debate.</p><p>
If science could have worked out an ideology like this, it would have long since appeared in at least one country.</p><p>
Anastasia. Now it no longer matters who she is. What does matter is something else.</p><p>
Against the backdrop of the bacchanalia now going on, Anastasia gave the world the idea of homesteads. It is now clear that with simple words she set out a philosophy, a new ideology, that has been solid in people's hearts since the time of the world's creation.</p><p>
Emperor and beggar, Christian and Jew, Muslim and Shintoist, Russian, Chinese, or American, they have always found the greatest solace for their soul and grace in the lap of Divine nature.</p><p>
Anastasia's philosophy is the philosophy of joining together—not in words but in the fact—the interests of different nations. As life has shown, people of different nationalities, including Jews, have accepted it. I have documentary proof for this.</p><p>
I am proposing to European analysts, Christians, and ideologues of patriotic movements that they discuss her ideas and her philosophical aspirations. The leaders of ordinary confessions big and small. Discussion itself is a creative process that can lead to a unity of opposites, which in turn can lead to "joint creation and joy for all from its contemplation," as God wanted it.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0718>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>18. Take Jesus Christ down from the Cross</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
I will say at the outset that we must not confuse the teaching of Jesus Christ and the selfless activities of the elders of the Russian church with that occult array of rituals we now encounter. The most beautiful teaching can be neutralized by occult methods.</p><p>
As you yourselves understand, Jesus Christ has nothing to do with this occultism.</p><p>
Not only that, He Himself to this day hangs on the cross thanks to the efforts of occultists and to our misunderstanding.</p><p>
It is no accident that I have devoted several chapters to the power of the energy of human thought, with the help of which people can form images. If this is understandable, then tell me what the most vivid image of Jesus Christ is in your thoughts and in the thoughts of most believers. A survey shows it is the image of Jesus Christ nailed to the cross.</p><p>
You will see the depiction of the crucifixion in every Orthodox and Catholic church. Who came up with this occult image and for what purpose? Did Jesus Christ himself want this depiction specifically to be the main one looming over all the rest? Of course not!</p><p>
However, we—and I mean we—through the power of our thoughts, continue to project the crucifixion—the crucifixion, note, not the resurrection. We kiss the crucifixion, not the resurrection. By so doing, we keep Him on the cross.</p><p>
This very simple occult device uses the energy of collective human thought to shape an image.</p><p>
Jesus Christ will continue to hang on the cross until we understand and take Him down with our thoughts, until we stop falling into occult traps.</p><p>
Since the very formation of religions, priests have striven to invest each of them with their own occult rituals and doctrines.</p><p>
Any religion, even the one with the most light, calling for goodness and nobility, with the inculcation of the priests' nuances became a very powerful weapon for them. With the help of this mechanism, they completely subjugated entire nations and set them against one another, all the way up to total self-annihilation. That is how it was and that is how it is today. Even today, many religions have occult rituals and doctrines whose meaning and degree of influence on humanity are known only to the priests.</p><p>
The projection of Jesus Christ's crucifixion through the thoughts of so many people comes about thanks to an occult ritual.</p><p>
Yet, the people themselves who perform this kind of projection—or rather, their souls, will be crucified as long as they go on projecting the crucifixion.</p><p>
The collective thought of the crucifixion is so strong that it even penetrates the flesh of people today. Jesus Christ's bleeding wounds, called the "mystery of the stigmata," periodically appear on the bodies of some believers. Many scholars believe the bleeding wounds to be the result of psychiatric illness. I would add to this that this is the illness not of an individual person but of a segment of society, and its primary cause is the occult ritual introduced by the priests.</p><p>
However, instead of thoroughly sorting out this phenomenon, enterprising people have built their business on it.</p><p>
For example, a woman, a stigmatic, Gladys Motta, lives in the Argentinean town of San Nicolas. Around her house, there is a lively trade in everything directly or indirectly linked to her.</p><p>
The Siberian elder said, "The murder of people by one another and what you call terrorism are the consequence of a priestly doctrine introduced into many religious confessions large and small.</p><p>
"It is they who came up with the doctrine about how the true Divine life of man is not on earth but in some other dimension. It is they who came up with the image of a heaven outside the earth created by God. Thanks to this doctrine, many religious fanatics develop a disdain for earthly life, so they are prepared, under quite minor influence on their psyche, to kill themselves and others.</p><p>
"Anastasia has been trying to impart this information using many phrases and various words. Not everyone will understand what Anastasia has said. Not everyone will understand what I say. You, Vladimir, and your readers must think carefully about what has been said and cite your own examples and arguments. Different tongues, merged into one, will be able to free men.</p><p>
"Look closely at the origin of wars and terrorism today, and you will clearly see the influence of a monstrous doctrine."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
The Siberian elder spoke a while longer on this topic. I sensed a slight agitation in him. Sometimes he would stop speaking and quickly stroke the piece of cedar hanging on his chest before once again returning to the fact that we ourselves must see and sense the manifestation of occult rituals and doctrines.</p><p>
"No spiritual teachers can rid people of them if people themselves do not begin to give this careful thought and learn to identify them," Anastasia’s grandfather said.</p><p>
I think I understood the significance of his assertions and decided to examine the phenomenon of terrorism in our life. In the future, we will have to sort this out together. For now, I will merely begin.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0719>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>19. Terror</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
In recent years, many countries have been lashed by a wave of terrorist acts. People have still not forgotten such large-scale attacks as September 11, 2001, in America. A terrible terrorist act was committed in our country quite recently. On October 23-26, 2002, terrorists seized more than eight hundred people who had come to see the musical Nord-Ost at Moscow's Theater Center on Dubrovka.</p><p>
Between these two large-scale attacks, less "spectacular" ones occurred in various places worldwide, taking many people’s lives.</p><p>
Each time, the governments of the different countries angrily condemn the terrorists. Secret services assure us of inevitable punishment for the perpetrators and take increasingly stringent precautionary measures.</p><p>
An international coalition to fight terrorism has been created. However, terror has not decreased even today. On the contrary, it has grown increasingly sophisticated and larger in scale. One gets the impression that someone always masterfully directs both the governments and the secret services down a false trail.</p><p>
Recently, the true source and main organizer of many terrorist acts in the world was tentatively identified in Russia.</p><p>
During the hostage seizure on October 23-26, many commentaries and interviews appeared on the leading television channels.</p><p>
Along with everything else, information was presented in the name of emergency headquarters by the Russian deputy interior minister. A fit, gray-haired man, he clipped his words, almost militarily. His speech was free of padding and sounds like "um" and marked by its concision and sensitivity, an indication that his thought moved fairly quickly and precisely. It was he who was one of the first to say, "We are dealing with religious fanatics." Many people may not have paid attention to this sentence. For the few who understand, this sounded like a clap of thunder in a clear blue sky. For the first time, and from the lips of a deputy interior minister at that, one of the fundamental bases of terrorism was called by its name.</p><p>
After the terrorist attack, another thought was advanced: "Islamic fundamentalism." Voices began to be heard about how Islamic fundamentalists had declared war on Christians and Jews—more specifically, on Israel, Russia, and the United States.</p><p>
How does one fight religious fanaticism? I propose calming down and examining the situation more thoughtfully.</p><p>
First of all, let us determine whether religious fanaticism is inherent to Islam alone or is part of other religions as well. Of course, it is. Let us recall history. Let us recall the Christians' many crusades. Let us recall the painting, "Boyarynia Morozova." Let us recall the names of the many martyrs prepared to sacrifice their own lives for the sake of some religious dogma. After death, they were elevated to the rank of saints.</p><p>
It is perfectly obvious that it is not religion as a whole in and of itself but specific dogmas inculcated in various religions that compel people to disdain their own life. A religious fanatic who becomes a suicide bomber is sure that he does not disdain life but, on the contrary, is crossing over to real life.</p><p>
How does this happen? Among believers, be they Muslim or Christian, one can always separate out a group of those most devoted to given dogmas. Further, with the help of occult rituals, their faith can be strengthened and led to the point of fanaticism. In this way, you get a biorobot who believes what he himself cannot see and cannot understand logically.</p><p>
Those who know the laws of psychology see full well which buttons on the biorobot to press, and they do, although not with their finger, of course. They simply name an object that must be destroyed for the sake of a bright life. The biorobots themselves begin to work out an operation to destroy it and follow through. Their own earthly life no longer has any significance for them. After all, they are sure of their own transition to a better, heavenly life.</p><p>
As long as the doctrine exists about a transcendent good not on earth but somewhere else, no secret services or army will eliminate terrorist suicide bombers.</p><p>
Now let us imagine the following. The secret services of the leading powers have united and through joint efforts destroyed every last terrorist. What does this change, though? New ones are born. After all, the doctrine that produces terrorism still exists.</p><p>
So where is the solution? Of course, traditional precautionary measures must be taken. But along with this, we have to understand and wipe out the pernicious doctrine that creates more and more new terrorist suicide bombers.</p><p>
Understand! This is the most important thing. Otherwise, the fight against terrorism will turn into a comical situation.</p><p>
Imagine such a situation. A religious fanatic, a terrorist suicide bomber, seizes an airplane and directs it at some important site in a populated city. Authorities negotiate with the terrorist and tell him they're prepared to meet his demands, but the negotiators cannot even imagine that the religious fanatic's stated demands are not his goal. His goal is to perish and be transported to the otherworldly heaven he imagines.</p><p>
The dogma of the otherworldly heaven influences nonbelievers as well. This dogma is projected by the collective thought of people of various religious confessions. It has had a pernicious effect on the entire human community for more than a millennium.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
What I am going to say right now may seem unrealizable, even fantastic. However, the sole bloodless solution to the problem may be the following.</p><p>
The patriarchs, muftis, elders of religious movements, and, above all, Christians, Catholics, and Muslims must be assembled immediately, closely assess the situation that has come about, and change the life-destroying doctrines in their religious teachings. Religious fanatics must be helped to regain a humane perception of the world. They must be told, "The Father is here, on earth, not somewhere else."</p><p>
What if the spiritual leaders do not assemble? What if they don't make such a statement?</p><p>
It doesn't matter,</p><p>
for it has already been done.</p><p>
It is simply that the statement from religious leaders, "Let us live as friend," has yet to touch anyone. Few believe the statements that we have nothing to do with terror; a more fundamental step is essential.</p><p>
I have said that such a religious assembly and its statement might be viewed as unreal. Let us consider, then, why such a simple and real action seems unreal.</p><p>
Why don't we believe that spiritual leaders invested with high rank might simply agree among themselves?</p><p>
If they cannot agree, then what can we expect from ordinary believers?</p><p>
If those leaders cannot agree themselves, then we must help them with the aid of the sensible public and governments.</p><p>
They must agree! If they don't, agree to such a program, bombs will do the talking at full force.</p><p>
So let human reason speak instead. The reason of God's children.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
At first glance, it might seem that positive changes in Russia and in other countries might come about from Anastasia's ideas only after a long time, that human consciousness changes gradually. However, practice has shown that in many readers it changes instantly.</p><p>
Let us examine what might happen with Chechnya if the Russian government and State Duma considered and passed a law allocating to each willing family a hectare of land to set up their own homestead—the kind Anastasia talked about.</p><p>
What would happen to Chechnya? Here’s what.</p><p>
The twenty thousand refugees who have been living in tents with their families for three years would get their own homesteads.</p><p>
In three years, the same tents that are now standing in dirty tent cities would today be standing in beautiful gardens. Some of the homesteaders would even have managed to build a house.</p><p>
Who is preventing such a thing from coming to pass? He who benefits not from peace but from something else, he who it trying to prevent any positive changes in Russia.</p><p>
You are trying in vain, boys! None of you has even a vague notion of who Anastasia is or what forces she now embodies.</p><p>
I'll say one thing: she will not simply create what she has contemplated; she has already created what she has contemplated. Right now the materialization is under way, and your opposition is confirmation of this. There is trash at any construction site, but they always pick it up afterward and plant flowers.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0720>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>20. Pagans</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
The main accusation against Anastasia is based on the idea that she is a pagan. Without any proof or consideration of the ideas the taiga hermit has advanced, although Anastasia has precisely and clearly called herself a Vedruss.</p><p>
What follows from Anastasia's alleged paganism? Japan is practically a pagan country right now. During its prime, the Roman Empire was pagan as well. Our fathers and mothers were pagans, too—and not just pagans. In the heyday of the Egyptian state and the Roman Empire, Vedian culture was still preserved in ancient Russia.</p><p>
Should we take pride in our pagan history, our origins, or be ashamed?</p><p>
We are told we should be ashamed of our origins.</p><p>
The words "paganism" and "pagan" have been turned into word-symbols of something bad and terrible. The word "Christian" has also become a word-symbol, but it connotes spirituality, decency, an enlightened mind, and closeness to God.</p><p>
Today we can observe the type of the Christian person and judge his merits by his deeds.</p><p>
We can judge based on our own present way of life. Yet we cannot judge anything! We simply cannot compare it with the maligned way of life of our pagan fathers and mothers, which has been hidden from us.</p><p>
In the end, of the history of our country offered up to us, we have been suggested the following.</p><p>
Our ancestors were some kind of horrible, ignorant people, but enlighteners came bringing an ideology developed in Israel: Christianity.</p><p>
The Russian Prince Vladimir accepted it and christened all of ancient Russia.</p><p>
Recently we celebrated the millennium of Russia's christening. But what is a thousand years? A flash in the context of billions of years. Well, let us imagine not a flash but a single day. Knowing how to condense time becomes very important. Right now you will see what comes of this.</p><p>
You wake up one beautiful, sunny morning and see visitors on the steps of your house. They tell you your parents were bad, terrible, pagans, and that you need to be Christians, stop interacting with nature, and pray for your sins, because your parents committed so many sins that their sin has been visited upon you.</p><p>
You immediately agree with the strangers' assertion and follow them to a temple and kiss their hands. You ask for their blessing and try not to even think about your parents. You wipe them from your memory, leaving only the concept of "terrible pagans."</p><p>
This is the picture one gets in a figurative condensation of time.</p><p>
For the last thousand years, our attention has been focused on a number of different events. They tell us who fought whom, who built what beautiful structures, which prince or tsar married whom, and who gained power and how. But compared with our relationship to our parents and their culture, this has no significant importance. All the other events, the disasters and adversities, flow inevitably from the main one: our betrayal of our parents.</p><p>
"But we didn't betray our parents," someone will say. "Those events happened more than a thousand years ago, after all, and completely different people were alive at the time."</p><p>
I can rephrase this and expand the time frame, but the essential meaning doesn't change if you say it that way.</p><p>
Your distant, very distant, great-great-etc.-mother was a pagan. She loved and understood nature. She knew the Universe and the significance of the rising sun. She gave birth to you, so very far away, in a beautiful garden. Your beautiful foremother rejoiced in you, and your father was happy at your appearance.</p><p>
Your forefathers, wanted you—so far from the present-day you—to make their beautiful dimension even more beautiful. They made sure present-day you would inherit this beautiful dimension, improved from generation to generation, so that the present-day you could live on an Earth transformed into a Divine, heavenly planet. They did this specifically for you.</p><p>
They were pagans, and they could understand God's thoughts through nature. Your very distant mama and papa knew how to make you happy. They knew because they were pagans.</p><p>
Your father perished in an unequal battle with foreign mercenaries fighting over your future.</p><p>
Your mama was burned on a bonfire because she did not want to change your beautiful future in the present day.</p><p>
But that day came.</p><p>
Today, the pagans' descendants today kiss on bended knee the hands of the descendants of those who burned their mothers and killed their fathers.</p><p>
They kiss them and compose songs about the impossibility of subduing Russia. They sing songs about the Russian spirit while slavishly crawling on their knees for more than a millennium.</p><p>
What freedom? Open your eyes! You have been under a yoke for a millennium, befuddled, as from narcotics, by a foreign ideology!</p><p>
Open your eyes and think, if you can. How could it happen that Anastasia, a Siberian hermit, a Russian, having said a few words about Russian history, immediately encountered opposition not just anywhere but in Russia specifically?</p><p>
If, as we believe, this country has not been taken over by ideologues from abroad, then who is offering resistance? It turns out that it is the Russians themselves who are opposing even the mention of their past and their parents. It is as if these Russians have lost their minds.</p><p>
Perhaps not entirely, though. Attesting to this are the millions of letters, songs, poems, and books in print with Anastasia's statements.</p><p>
Russians' hearts are beginning to beat in unison with the hearts of their distant and close parents, who dreamed of their children's happiness. The opposition is being provoked by mercenaries and their accomplices. What mercenaries? What mercenaries’ accomplices?</p><p>
Do you seriously think that some Russian prince by the name of Vladimir changed the way of life of the entire Russian people with his word? He wasn't even yet very secure on his princely throne. Do you actually believe he sat and sat and suddenly said, "Boys, I think you should forget the culture of your parents and be converted to Christianity."</p><p>
Did the people enthusiastically respond, "Yes, of course, we're sick of our ancestors' culture. Come on, prince, christen us."</p><p>
Absurd? Of course, it's absurd. In actual fact, Prince Vladimir first tried to increase his power by changing the religious worldview of the ancient Slavs, creating a pantheon of pagan divinities for this purpose. However, pagan beliefs could neither sanctify the social relations taking shape nor justify material and social inequality, the exploitation of man by man, or the "divine ordination" of princely power. This forced Prince Vladimir to choose an alien religion for the Russian people in order to satisfy his political ambitions. Nor is it a secret that the choice fell on the Byzantine version of Christianity, inasmuch as it provided for the actual subordination of the clergy to princely power, despite its legal subordination to the Constantinople patriarchate. We were assured that he did this for the good of the enlightenment and prosperity of ancient Russia.</p><p>
We all know that a change in ideologies is linked to social cataclysms and bloodshed. But here what happened was not simply a change of ideologies. The religion, culture and way of life, and social order changed radically.</p><p>
If we compare what happened in those days with the 1917 revolution, then this was "revolution squared." If after this revolution there had been a bloody civil war, then it would have been "civil war squared."</p><p>
There was no civil war simply because in pagan Russia there were only pagans. They tell us about opposition, including armed opposition between the Christians and pagans of ancient Russia. But if all of ancient Russia was pagan, then how did there get to be Christians in ancient Russia? They came from outside, with the mercenaries. By that time, Prince Vladimir was far from the mightiest prince. Of course, the prince maintained his own armed force. However, we know from history that for there to be any serious military actions, this armed force was not enough. It always required the support of the people. In ancient Russia, the popular militia was always the main military force.</p><p>
But what kind of popular militia can we talk about if the entire nation was opposed to Christianization?</p><p>
Mercenaries from outside? Of course! But there were not enough funds in the prince's treasury to hire an entire army and pay for its work. Of course, there weren’t! But he got the necessary military support. From whom?</p><p>
From the patriarchs of Rome and other Christianized countries, who had become quite wealthy by that time.</p><p>
Thus, a thousand years ago, the half-Russian Prince Vladimir, in exchange for reinforcing his power, allowed foreign emissaries to conduct propaganda and organize intrigues and provocations in ancient Russia and to perpetrate violence against the Russian people.</p><p>
Ancient Russia proved more steadfast than the Roman Empire and did not fall for the propaganda to any great extent. Consequently, the prince's armed force was reinforced with mercenaries and some of the unbowed population destroyed.</p><p>
This is just one historical opinion, opponents might say. On the contrary, gentlemen ideologues, this is objective historical fact. It can be proven even without possessing Anastasia's phenomenal abilities or her knowledge of history. Now even I, an ordinary person, can prove this to you as well, and that means many ordinary people will be able to sort this out as well.</p><p>
Tell me, gentlemen adherents of occult ideologies, how many million Russian fathers and mothers did you burn alive on the bonfires? Name your number, even if it's low. Or do you contend that this didn't happen? It did! even your sources mention this. Remember.</p><p>
At an assembly in the fifteenth century, the trans-Volga elders raised the question of rescinding the death penalty for heretics. Note, this happened five hundred years after Christianization, but the people of ancient Russia were still resisting. The punishment was not abolished, and an unenviable fate overtook the trans-Volga elders.</p><p>
If you want to consider what I've said as just one version, go right ahead.</p><p>
However, consider your assertions as a version then, too, and we will compare the two.</p><p>
Upon comparison, you can see right away that yours does not hold up to any logic. It is based on mere assertions that you demand be taken for the truth. In addition, you cannot present any documents whatsoever confirming, for example, human sacrifice by the pagans of ancient Russia.</p><p>
Show people the archeological evidence. Dig up the victims. It won't work because there weren't any.</p><p>
Show us the pagans' books where they set out their views of the world. Let people themselves compare the cultures of the two civilizations.</p><p>
You won't? Why? It’s because once people read the texts, they will see the full insanity of our present way of life.</p><p>
There is no proof of your utopian version. You demand simply that everyone believe you and that’s that. Believe us, and if you don’t want to, you will be labeled an unbeliever, a spiritually impoverished person.</p><p>
One can find evidence that ancient Russia was enslaved with the help of intrigues and forces. I will not cite the long list. For illustration, I will tell you about one of them.</p><p>
Since then and up to the present day, ancient Russia can be considered to have been enslaved. Even today, a foreign ideology dominates Russia. Even today, Russia pays tribute. Only the form of payment is different: the flow of capital, the selling of minerals, the imposition of low-quality foreign foods. Even today, the ideological component can be very closely traced.</p><p>
The mere mention of the culture of ancient Russia sets the mechanism of opposition in motion, and the intrigues and attacks on Anastasia never cease.</p><p>
You talk about freedom of speech, why are you so afraid of hers? Why do you strive to slander her and keep the people from getting to know the culture of their own country? Here is why.</p><p>
The culture of our ancestors is beautiful, joyous, and highly spiritual!</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
In my previous book, The Family Book, I told Anastasia's story about the wedding ritual for two people in love. Just two thousand years ago, this ritual still existed in ancient Russia. After this publication came the conclusions of scholars and researchers. I have already said that lately Anastasia's statements have been studied by scholars from various branches of science; some are doing this openly and even trying to publish their works, while others are simply sending them to the Foundation for us to read. In order not to subject them, too, to attacks, I will not indicate their names but merely give the gist of their statements.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"The wedding ritual that existed in the culture of ancient Russia and presented by Anastasia is a unique and priceless document that attests to the very high level of knowledge of the ancient Russians. The entire ritual is based not on beliefs in the supernatural, but specifically on the knowledge of what we now call supernatural.</p><p>
"Individual elements of this ritual can be seen among various ethnicities even today. But in the modern interpretation, these elements are purely ritualistic, unconscious, and incomplete in nature, and consequently do not help strengthen the union of the two lovers to the degree to which they were effective under their conscious application.</p><p>
"In their modern form, some of them seem pointless, based on superstitions, and at best move into the category of so-called esoteric actions. The ritual presented by Anastasia makes the unconscious quality a conscious quality of the greatest rationality and speaks not only of the knowledge but of the unsurpassed level of spirituality of the Slav generations that preceded ours."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"In a comparative analysis of present-day wedding actions and the ritual presented by Anastasia, one gets the sense that contemporary rituals are more inherent to an undeveloped, primitive society, while the ancient Russian one is inherent to the highest civilization in all respects.</p><p>
"For example, among several ethnicities, including the Russians, there is a ritual action of sprinkling the young wedded or civilly registered couple with grain. One of the newlyweds' mothers, grandmothers, or relatives sprinkles grain before the young people enter their house or tosses grain right on the young people, by this action intending the future family’s prosperity.</p><p>
"These contemporary actions can be categorized with superstitions or esoterica. It does not make conscious sense. How can we make sense of their rationality if the seeds that fall on the floor, asphalt, or path to the house entrance are immediately trampled?</p><p>
"In the ritual Anastasia presents, there is also an action involving grain. But it bears several precisely contemplated, rational meanings at once. Everyone who comes to the young people's wedding— relatives, acquaintances, and friends—brings seeds from their best plants, and each with his own hand plants the seed brought in the spot indicated by the young people.</p><p>
“If we are speaking about material prosperity, then it is not merely intended but actually achieved by this action. In a very short period of time, an hour or two, the newlyweds are given a future orchard, made up of the best fruit and berry plantings, a vegetable garden, and a green fence framing their dimension as well."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
“No less important is the second, psychological aspect of this action. Many of us can tie an improvement in our psychological condition to going out in nature. Pleasant sensations increase upon touching not just anyone's garden plantings but specifically those which belong to you. What the force of the spirit must have been, the level of the emotional state of someone entering a garden where each tree, bush, and herb was created as a gift to you directly from your parents, relatives, and friends, we can only conjecture today because probably no one living on earth today can have this kind of dimension.</p><p>
"Evidently, not only material prosperity but positive inner emotions specifically that are the consequence of this action played the main part."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"In contemporary esoteric literature, much is said about the energy of kundalini and about the chakras. The information presented mainly focuses attention on the possibility of the existence of chakras. Of the existence of the energy of love and the energy of the sexual attraction of a man for a woman, on the contrary, hardly anyone has any doubts.</p><p>
"The overwhelming majority of people have experienced the effect of this energy themselves. However, neither the theoreticians of the past nor present-day science have indicated the possibility of man controlling this energy.</p><p>
"In the ritual presented by Anastasia, it is shown for the first time how man can control, transform, and preserve this energy."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"Basically, the young lovers materialize the energy of love that has come down to or entered into them. With the help of this energy, they shape the visible and tangible dimension around themselves. They keep this great energy by their side for eternity.</p><p>
"Why was this possible for them but not in our present reality? Let us compare the actions of two couples in love, one from the past, and one from the present time.</p><p>
"The average statistical modern couple in love spends time visiting entertainment institutions, alone on walks and at home, and often, even before entering into marriage, entering into sexual relations."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"The main goal of most lovers is the official registration of their relationship in a secular institution or a church.</p><p>
"As the research shows, lovers do not construct very precise or specific plans for their further life. If someone does try to define their further joint actions after entering into marriage, then the definitions are fairly abstract in nature. As psychologists note, each hopes that after they are joined together, their life will be improved by their partner.</p><p>
"Each hopes that the lofty state of love that fills their life will be preserved even after they enter into marriage. But love passes. The surrounding dimension becomes ordinary and doesn't just not remind them of being in love but also begins to irritate by its ordinariness and primitivism.</p><p>
"Irritation arises with respect to each other, too. Few suspect that this irritation is not the reason for lovers' actions after entering into marriage. Dissatisfaction comes as a consequence of the inability to make use of the state of being in love."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"As practice has shown, no secular laws or religious intimidation is capable of preserving love or even a respectful attitude toward each other.</p><p>
"Now let us look at the actions of the two lovers from Anastasia's story and try to give them a logical, scientific explanation.</p><p>
"Above all, the declaration of love itself is striking.</p><p>
"'With you, beautiful goddess, I could create a dimension of Love for the ages,' he told his chosen one. If the girl responded with love, she would reply, 'My god, I am prepared to help you in the great co-creation.'</p><p>
"Let us compare this with the declaration of love presented by an outstanding poet, which characterizes most accurately the essence of modern attitudes toward the energy of love: 'I love you, what more can I say. . . .'</p><p>
"As we can see, the first declaration immediately proposes a great and precisely conditioned action, the shaping of a dimension of love—basically, the scientific materialization of love.</p><p>
"The second states a fact, 'I love you,' but does not propose further action. He and she simply do not know how to use the energy of love, or for what."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"The lovers from Anastasia's story, having received each other's pledge, set about shaping a dimension of love for both themselves and their future generations.</p><p>
"They seclude themselves, they may even spend the night in the shelter built on the parcel of land they've chosen, but they do not enter into sexual relations. What is this, ritual abstinence?"</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"Similar abstinence is encountered in the religious beliefs of many nations. It exists in worldly ethics as well. Young lovers should not enter into sexual relations before registering their marriage or before their wedding. However, the overwhelming majority of lovers ignore the religious admonitions and social condemnations, entering into sexual relations before registering their marriage in a secular institution or in a church. Why? The most likely answer might be the absence of logic in the demands of society and religion, the absence of a distinct explanation, or to put it even more precisely, the absence of knowledge of the essence of the energy of love.</p><p>
"The energy of love activates an entire set of feelings in a person and accelerates thinking processes. This energy can be compared with the highest point of inspiration, which assumes further actions.</p><p>
"Lovers in ancient Russia, thanks to their very high culture of human interrelations and knowledge, naturally directed the energy of love and sexual attraction into the action of creating a dimension for their future life together."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
"Scientific research surpassing what is created by two lovers hardly seems possible. This assumption is attested to by the following assertion of Anastasia's: 'The scholarly world will not be able to create even a likeness of a beautiful homestead as well because of the Universal law that one Creator, inspired by love, is stronger than all the sciences, which lack love.'</p><p>
"All the actions of the participants in the events reflected in Anastasia's story about the wedding ritual are permeated with logic, rationalism, and the highest spirituality and culture of being. Before this, the modern wedding, where the main thing is the feast with its abundance of food and liquor, looks so squalid.</p><p>
"The parables and rituals of ancient pagan—or, as Anastasia puts it, Vedian—Russia presented by Anastasia, saturated as they are with emotion, meaning, and information, surpass all the ancient sayings characterizing the historic past previously known to us. Even the so well-known Lay of Igor's Campaign pales by comparison.</p><p>
"With her narratives about Vedian Russia, Anastasia basically opens up for us the highly spiritual culture of a civilization previously unknown to us. The notion of history present in science, not only of our country but of all humanity, is changing at its root.</p><p>
"Such an unexpected and fundamental turnaround, and the simplicity with which it was done, has bewildered many luminaries of modern science. And in order to stay within the framework of their current scientific position, many are trying to pretend that nothing has happened, that they are unfamiliar with this information.</p><p>
"They are like an ostrich hiding its head in the sand. The information exists, it is truly priceless and sensational, and more and more people want to know it."</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
I have quoted for you, esteemed readers, the statements of individual scientific researchers. As you see, they confirm the important information value contained in Anastasia's statements. They also speak to the bewilderment of the scientific world.</p><p>
But bewilderment is one thing. The opposition and efforts undertaken to prevent the spread of this information, which sheds light on the history of our country and our nation, are something completely different.</p><p>
Someone greatly fears the possibility of us coming into contact with our ancestral culture and knowledge. Who is that? Under whose pressure, pursuing what program, are those acting today who call our forefathers barbarous pagans and who have tainted the great word "pagans" with the implication of something terrible and backward?</p><p>
Why have our historians agreed with this definition? They've agreed, but, then, these are not our historians.</p><p>
Are they historians at all? If to this day they can tell us nothing intelligible about the times a mere thousand years ago, while at the same time they insult or agree with insults to this antiquity, then these are not Russia's historians but traitors or mercenaries acting in someone's interests.</p><p>
We must not rely on them anymore. We must make our own joint efforts, little by little, based on analogies, to restore our own past and rehabilitate our forefathers and ourselves. If we don't do this. . . .</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
Many of the readers of the books in the "Ringing Cedars of Russia" series have already begun to write their own family book for their children. What if someone wants to express his opinion about the history of ancient Russia as well and tell his children from whom we came? But what can he write about his own past? Will we really write about the nonsense they fill us with?</p><p>
Maybe we shouldn't write anything about the past, as if it never happened. That won't work, for after we are gone, our children will continue to be offered whatever is to that someone else's good.</p><p>
Someone might wonder, "How are we, ordinary people, not scholarly historians, going to be able to reconstruct the history of two to three thousand years ago?" We can do this because we will do it not on someone’s order but at the behest of our mind and heart. I will try to begin, but let us gather together all the legends, facts, and analogies, each according to his ability, and begin to shape the history of our line.</p><p>
Let us begin to think and reason together. I repeat, a great deal can be restored even by analogy. Here is how this is done by analogy. Look.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
More than two thousand years ago, there was the mighty Roman Empire—Roman law, a senate, and emperors. The empire's cities were adorned with monumental buildings, and the capital already had a water supply. There were libraries, and the arts flourished. The Roman Empire waged quite a few wars.</p><p>
On the backdrop of the states of the pre-Christian period, there is almost no information at all about the Russian state—its political structure, territories, and culture.</p><p>
Perhaps it didn’t exist? Of course, it existed. We know from historical sources that at the time ancient Russia accepted Christianity there were already cities and principalities and that Prince Vladimir, under whom ancient Russia accepted Christianity, was far from the first prince. The same sources talk about his father, Prince Svyatoslav.</p><p>
This means that ancient Russia existed during the times of the Roman Empire. Its cities and many very wealthy settlements existed—very wealthy because the cities of ancient Russia were formed not only as the capitals of principalities but also as craft and trading centers serving the many settlements surrounding them.</p><p>
Cities cannot be born if the settlements are poor. There would simply be no one to finance their construction, and no one in the future to consume what the city produced.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
Now let us try to determine whether pre-Christian Russia was a strong or weak state. Let us suppose it was very, very weak. In addition, historians assert that ancient Russia was divided up into small appendage principalities that were constantly quarreling among themselves.</p><p>
But once again the question arises, if pre-Christian Russia was a weak state torn by internecine conflicts, then why did mightier powers not try to conquer it?</p><p>
Weak compared with other states, to say nothing of the Roman Empire itself, the Russian state was not hard to conquer, turn into a colony, and force to pay tribute. But this is where the mystery and puzzle begin.</p><p>
The historical documents of the Roman Empire and other powerful state entities do not record any attack on ancient Russia.</p><p>
As we ourselves know, up to the moment of its Christianization, ancient Russia was an independent state conquered by no one.</p><p>
Why didn't anyone try to conquer pagan Russia?</p><p>
Did it have a large, well-organized, and well-equipped army? No, it didn’t. Even during the princely period there were only armed forces smaller than the Roman legions.</p><p>
We will never learn the historical truth if we take initially for our basis the false notion of a pagan, to say nothing of Vedian, Russia.</p><p>
On the contrary, everything falls into place if we accept and understand the opposite.</p><p>
Vedian, pre-princely Russia was a highly spiritual and highly organized civilization. It is this civilization "lost" on earth that legends will be told of later on.</p><p>
I have purposely called ancient Russia a civilization rather than a state because the model of statehood in that era was Egypt or Rome, ruled by supreme rulers, priests and an elite grown wealthy at the expense of slaves.</p><p>
The social structure of ancient Russia was more perfect and civilized than that of Egypt or Rome.</p><p>
* * *</p><p>
In the Russia of that era, there was no slavery in general. Nor were there appendage principalities quarreling among themselves. Ancient Russia consisted of beautiful homesteads. Decisions were made in popular assemblies, town hall meetings. Information was disseminated by magi.</p><p>
But look at how they subordinated and distorted the meaning of the word "civilization." When the priests and pharaohs ruled Egypt, the entire nation was called a solid, highly developed, civilized state, but Russia was considered backward, uncivilized, and weak and without statehood. Indeed! If there were neither slaves nor petty tyrants, does not that mean there was no state and it was uncivilized?</p><p>
And again, the same question.</p><p>
Why did no one conquer Russia then?</p><p>
There were attempts to conquer the Vedrusses, of course, but those would-be conquerors always tried to wipe away the outcomes from even their own memory.</p><p>
Here is what Anastasia recounted about one such attempt more than two thousand years ago.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0721>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>21. Battle</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
“In those days, Vladimir, the culture of the Vedian way of life still dominated ancient Russia. At the time, the Vedruss still did not have towns. A great many settlements, rich in unusual food, joy, and radiant people living on their own homesteads, comprised ancient Russia. In those times, other countries teemed with cities, and the power of money came to rule more and more over human aspirations. There were great armies, too, with which rulers tried to subject the world to themselves, and many countries worshiped the dark force.</p><p>
“A select Roman legion was sent to Russia. Five thousand soldiers came up to the border of the first small settlement and set up a menacing camp close to the settlement’s outskirts.</p><p>
“The military commanders summoned the elders. The elders came, knowing no fear before the menacing power. The military commanders explained to the elders that they were from the mightiest country of all and so demanded that all the settlements pay them tribute. Anyone who couldn't pay would be taken into slavery.</p><p>
“The elders of the small settlement replied that it did not befit them to feed bad men with their food and thereby feed the masses of the dark forces.</p><p>
“The supreme military chief told the oldest of the settlement elders, ‘I knew about your barbarism and your unusual daily life. Your mind cannot even assess our relative strength. With a mind like that, you will never be free in a civilized empire. You will be slaves or you will not be at all.’</p><p>
“The Vedruss elder replied, ‘He who cannot consume the Divine for his food will not be. Look.’</p><p>
“With these words, the Vedruss elder took two beautiful apples out of his pocket, identical and fresh. He cast his glance over the military commanders, their armor gleaming, but his eyes rested on an ordinary young soldier. He walked up to the soldier, held out one of the apples to him, and said, ‘Take this, son. May this fruit be to your soul’s liking.’</p><p>
“The Roman soldier took the ordinary fruit and tasted it as those standing beside him watched. Contentment lit up the young soldier's face, to the envy of the others.</p><p>
“Holding the second beautiful apple in his hand, the elder turned to the military commander again, walked up to him, and said, ‘My soul has no desire to offer you this beautiful fruit. What this means, you must try to understand yourself.’</p><p>
“The Vedruss elder placed the second apple at the military commander's feet.</p><p>
“‘How dare you be so insolent, old man, to a commander who has distinguished himself in battle?’ a Roman orderly exclaimed, and he quickly picked up the apple, and the surprised man gasped.</p><p>
“Everyone invested with rank and their servants froze, watching. The very beautiful apple rotted in the orderly's hands, right before their eyes. Right before their eyes, a swarm of midges suddenly appeared and ate up the rotting fruit. The old Vedruss continued.</p><p>
“‘No one can buy the Divine grace of fruits for gold or take them by force. You may call yourself a lord, you may have confidence that you will subdue countries, but in doing so you will only be tasting rot.’”</p><p>
</p><p>"This is not mysticism, Vladimir. You must understand. Fruits grown with love can give their grace only to someone who has put love in them and who has been given them freely by whoever grew them. Everything in the Universe is arranged this way, and for its proof in the present day, take a close look. People have long been doomed to taste fruits that are not fresh."</p><p>
"What about the rich, and those who rule the world?"</p><p>
"For them food problems are even greater. They're afraid of poisoned fruits and refined dishes. Before they eat it themselves, they force those close to them to test their food. They place a guard over their food and secret services, but in vain. Many rulers have died in agony from bad food. Notice that today many are trying to produce the very healing cedar oil. But cedar oil differs in its healing quality because the intentions of its producers differ.</p><p>
"This old Vedruss was not a mystic. He was merely talking about what every child in Vedian Russia knew."</p><p>
</p><p>“But the Vedruss had aroused the commander's anger, and he was seized and put in a cage so he could watch the burning of the settlement's houses and gardens and the men, women, and children walking before him in chains.</p><p>
“The military commander told him nastily, ‘Old man, here are your tribesmen, and now they are slaves. You shouldn't have made fun of me in front of my entire retinue. You gave me a fruit that rotted instantly. Now all your fellow tribesmen are slaves, and they will grow fruit that does not rot for fear of death.’</p><p>
“‘Only something lethal can be grown under the fear of death, even if it looks handsome. You are primitive. You will not be able to subjugate my country. I released a dove with news of you. When they see the dove, the magi will tell everyone.’</p><p>
“The Roman commander gave an order. Vedruss couriers rushed to get his order to all the settlements. The order demanded that representatives come from each settlement to see how strong and trained in war and well-armed his forces were and how they could wipe recalcitrant settlements off the face of the earth and take their children and young wives into slavery. He ordered that all should bring tribute to the soldiers and that henceforth each fall should gather and bring tribute to his state.</p><p>
“On the day set by the order, with the dawn, ninety Vedruss youths stood before the huge military camp.</p><p>
“In front of them all stood Radomir, whom we know. He wore a shirt lovingly embroidered by Liubomila, and the youths behind him wore bright shirts.</p><p>
“Their dark blond heads were not covered with steel helmets. Woven grass braids framed their heads. They had no shields to ward off lethal blows. Only two swords hung from the waist of each young Vedruss. They stood silently, held their horses by the reins, and many of the fast horses were not saddled.</p><p>
“Assembling for a council, the military commanders of the trained force of five thousand looked at the ninety youths. The senior commander walked up to the cage where the Vedruss of the burned settlement was held, and asked, ‘What might these young men mean? I ordered the elders of all settlements to appear for the proclamation of the law of my country’s emperor.’</p><p>
“The Vedruss replied from his cage, ‘The elders of the settlements know what you want to tell them. They don't like your speeches and decided not to come for something unpleasant. Before the camp of your troops are just ninety youths from the neighboring settlement. They have swords at their waists, and they may want to do battle.’</p><p>
“‘Oh, brainless barbarians,’ the head commander thought. ‘Sending a unit of soldiers into battle with them and felling them would not be difficult work, of course. But what is the point of dead bodies? Wouldn't it be better to explain to them and bring healthy slaves for the emperor?’</p><p>
“‘Listen to me, old man,’ the commander addressed the Vedruss. ‘The young people respect you, after all. Explain to them the futility of unequal battle. Suggest they surrender. I will spare their lives. Naturally, I'll capture and enslave them all. However, they will not be living in a barbarian country and will be given clothing and food when they become obedient slaves. You explain to them the futility of a bloody, unequal battle.’</p><p>
“The Vedruss replied, ‘I'll try. I'll explain it to them. I myself see the blood is up in the young Vedrusses.’</p><p>
“‘Then speak, old man.’</p><p>
“The Vedruss began speaking from his cage loudly, so that the young Vedrusses standing before the camp would hear him.</p><p>
“‘I see two swords at your waists, my sons. I see hot-blooded steeds beside you. You are holding them by the reins, you are not burdening them with yourselves, rather you are safeguarding their powers for war. You have decided to do battle, and your marshal is the wise Radomir. Answer me.’</p><p>
“The commanders and troops saw Radomir step forward and bow low to the elder in the cage, thus confirming the Vedruss's words.</p><p>
“‘That is what I thought,’ the old Vedruss said, and he continued.</p><p>
“‘You are the marshal, Radomir. You understand, and I believe that you face forces unequal to yours.’</p><p>
“Radomir bowed again at the Vedruss's words, thereby giving him an affirmative answer.</p><p>
“The commanders were satisfied with the dialog. But what followed astounded them most unspeakably. The old Vedruss continued.</p><p>
“‘Radomir, you are young and your thought races quickly, so spare the strangers' lives. Do not kill them all. Make them go away and lay down their arms and never toy with them again.’</p><p>
“At first the commanders seemed struck dumb by the Vedruss's unusual words. Then the main commander shouted in irritation, ‘You've lost your mind! You're crazy, old man! You don't realize who safeguards whose life here. You have condemned all your fellow tribesmen to death. I will now give the order.’</p><p>
“‘You're too late. Look, Radomir was contemplating, but he bowed to my words, and that means he understood them and will let you live.’</p><p>
“The next instant, the commanders saw the ninety youths standing in front of the camp leap onto their horses and gallop swiftly toward the camp. The commander managed to give the order to a unit of archers that had moved up to prepare to meet the Vedruss horsemen with a hail of arrows.</p><p>
“But when the horsemen reached the distance where they could be hit by an arrow, they suddenly leapt off their horses and ran alongside them.</p><p>
“Coming right up to the Roman host, the young Vedruss formed an oval, in the middle of which was half their detachment and the horses, while the second half cut into the ranks of the Romans and entered into combat.</p><p>
“Each Vedruss warrior held a sword in each hand. They fought deftly with their right and left hands identically. Yet they did not strike outright but knocked their opponent's weapon out of his hands and did not wound him mortally.</p><p>
“The wounded and disarmed Roman legionaries prevented new soldiers from moving up right away and replacing them.</p><p>
“The small detachment of Vedruss swiftly cleared a path to the tent of the main military commander.</p><p>
“With his sword, Radomir slashed through the bars of the cage where the old Vedruss was, bowed to him, then took him past the encampment and lifting him easily, sat him on his horse.</p><p>
“Two young warriors from Radomir's detachment seized the main military commander, threw him over the rump of another horse, and led him to the middle of their oval.</p><p>
“The desperate detachment quickly cleared itself a path, but going forward, not backward. Soon after they emerged from the crush of the Roman force and leapt onto their horses, but when they had galloped for a few minutes, they stopped on a small rise, and nearly all of them rushed to lay down on the grass, arms spread wide, and fell still.</p><p>
“The captive Roman commander watched in amazement as the Vedruss lying in the grass slept solidly. Blissful smiles lit their faces, and their horses clipped the grass peacefully next to each sleeping man. Only two patrols observed the actions of the Roman forces.</p><p>
“Left without their commander, the Roman officers argued for a while, blaming each other for what had happened. Then they argued over who was to take command and how to act.</p><p>
“Eventually, they decided to send a thousand horsemen, almost their entire cavalry, to chase down the Vedruss detachment. The rest were to follow in the direction of the pursuit in the event of unforeseen events or in the event that the Vedruss received reinforcements, though they made their decision mainly out of fear.</p><p>
“The detachment of a thousand well-equipped horsemen raced in pursuit. As soon as the ranks of Roman cavalrymen began to leave the camp, one of the warriors in Radomir's detachment sitting on his horse blew his horn.</p><p>
“The Vedruss lying on the ground immediately jumped up, took their horses by the reins, and ran off. Having rested after battle, they ran very quickly, but the Roman cavalry racing after them was still catching up to the runners—very slowly, but gaining nonetheless.</p><p>
“The cavalry commander, in anticipation of success catching up with the running men, gave the order to trumpet an acceleration, and the trumpeter trumpeted.</p><p>
“The thousand spurred-on horses, which were already lathered up, accelerated their already insane speed, cutting the distance to the Vedruss in front of them. Only a small distance now separated them.</p><p>
“The excited commander demanded more speed once again, and the trumpeter trumpeted once more. Some of the Roman horses, ridden too hard, fell from the mad gallop. No one paid any attention to them. The Roman horsemen drew their swords in order to strike those running away, and suddenly, at the sound of the horn, all the running Vedruss leapt on their horses and the distance from their pursuers began to increase.</p><p>
“The captive Roman commander realized that the Vedruss had spared their horses and now they could not be caught. They were under the old Vedruss, and under the old Vedruss changed horses. The Roman also saw that the Vedruss were not sitting but lying prone on their horses' backs, holding onto their manes, and were once again sleeping.</p><p>
“The Roman thought, ‘Why do they need to gather their strength now?’ Only subsequently was he able to understand.</p><p>
“The Romans, worked up by the chase, beat their horses furiously, and the horses fell underneath them, but even the hardier ones, carrying riders heavy from their armor, could not catch up with the Vedruss horses, which were not wearied by the chase.</p><p>
“The cavalry commander, when he finally understood that he wasn't going to catch the Vedruss detachment, ordered everyone to speed up, but it was too late. Some of the horses, already overheated, fell to their knees.</p><p>
“‘All rest,’ the cavalry commander ordered, and immediately the soldiers who had dismounted from their weary horses saw the Vedruss detachment come rushing straight down on them like a whirlwind.</p><p>
“The young horsemen were holding two swords in each hand at the ready. They were galloping along the edge of the tired Romans and wounding the soldiers, knocking their weapons out of their hands.</p><p>
“Horror gripped the entire Roman legion. Everyone who had been following on foot came running up to help. The Vedruss horsemen galloped after the running men but for some reason did not run them down. They did not touch the Roman soldiers who had fallen from exhaustion.</p><p>
“The crowd of soldiers, no longer running, but walking heavily, teetering from exhaustion, stopped at once when they saw Radomir before them with two swords and the horsemen behind him, full of strength and calm.</p><p>
“The Romans dropped to the ground, and anyone who had a weapon laid it down in front of him. Broken, they awaited retribution.</p><p>
“Radomir and his comrades walked among the Roman soldiers sitting on the grass. The Vedruss swords were resting in their sheaths. Radomir and his comrades spoke with the soldiers about life. Removing the woven grass bands from around their head, they gave them to the wounded soldiers of Rome to put the life-giving herbs on their wounds.</p><p>
“The herbs stopped the blood oozing from the wounds and took away the pain. The Vedruss returned the main commander to the Roman legion.”</p><p>
</p><p>“Orderly columns, returning from their campaign against Vedian Rus, entered Rome.</p><p>
“The emperor had been informed by couriers of the odd things that had happened to the select soldiers of Rome's legions. When he himself saw his soldiers and commanders, dismay haunted the emperor for several weeks.</p><p>
“Then he issued a secret decree. All the detachments that had taken part in the campaign against Vedian Rus, the soldiers and commanders of the army, were to be sent to different ends of the empire, under strict orders not to talk about that campaign, even to their friends and closest relatives.</p><p>
“The emperor himself never sent troops to make war on ancient Russia again. In a secret book, he wrote to his successors: ‘If you want to preserve the empire, do not even think of waging war against the Vedruss.’</p><p>
“The emperor was not stupid. He realized that his forces had returned whole and unharmed but without spoils or anger in their faces, without any desire to serve as soldiers. If men like that were left in the imperial army, who knew? They might infect the empire's entire army with a similar reluctance to enter into battle.”</p><p>
</p><p>“Nevertheless, the emperor's successor did attempt to wage war on the Vedruss again. Having learned much about their tactics from those who had previously been in contact with them, he sent ten thousand soldiers on a campaign against ancient Russia. The army once again approached a small settlement of Vedruss, and made camp, and fortified it quickly. They sent couriers to summon the elders.</p><p>
“At the appointed hour, the military commanders saw a girl of ten and a boy of five walking from the Vedruss settlement toward their menacing camp. The soldiers parted before them, and the children walked to the center of the camp, arguing between them. The boy, tugging at his sister's skirt, said, ‘When you don't let me conduct the talks myself, dear sister Palashechka, I don't think well of you.’</p><p>
“‘What don't you think well about me, you scamp?’ the sister asked the brother.</p><p>
“‘I think, dear sister Palashechka, that you were born a very mean girl.’</p><p>
“‘You shouldn't think like that.’</p><p>
“‘I shouldn't, so let me conduct the talks with the enemies.’</p><p>
“‘If I agree, what will you think of me?’</p><p>
“‘I'll think my dear sister Palashechka is prettier, smarter, and better than everyone else.’</p><p>
“‘You start the talks, little brother. It doesn't suit me to be dealing with rattle-brains.’</p><p>
“The children stood before the commanders boldly, and the younger brother, not ruffled in the least, told the commanders, ‘My uncle told me to tell everyone that there is a holiday at the temple in our village today. It comes around every year, and every year all the people have a good time at the temple. My uncle said it doesn't befit him to tear himself away from the celebrations and rattle on with you. He sent me, and my sister here tagged along.’</p><p>
“The main commander actually screeched at the boy's cheeky speech. He turned pale and grabbed his sword.</p><p>
“‘You impudent spawn. How dare you speak to me like that? You will be a slave with my horses until you are an old, old man. . . . Your sister—‘</p><p>
“‘Oh, dear men,’ the sister broke into the conversation. ‘Oh, dear men, throw away your knick-knacks—your swords, shields, and lances—and run home as fast as you can. Run for all you're worth. There is a cloud moving in, and it is not going to talk with strangers at all. It will enter into battle without discussion.’</p><p>
“The little girl unknotted her bundle, took a pinch of some kind of pollen, sprinkled it on her brother, and then took some more and sprinkled what was left on herself.</p><p>
“And a cloudlet flew swift and low over the earth toward the Romans' encampment, droning, and growing in size. It covered the encampment. Soon after, the Romans' armor was lying on the ground, their shields, their lances and swords. The commanders' pavilions and soldiers' tents were empty. The little brother and sister were standing in the middle of the Romans' goods, and the little brother told his big sister, ‘You still didn't let me talk with our enemies, dear sister Palashechka. I didn't tell them everything I wanted to.’</p><p>
“‘On the other hand, you did get to begin. Don't be angry if I did get in your way a little, Vedruss warrior, defender of our homeland.’</p><p>
“‘Oh, all right. I'm still going to think you're not mean, you're a pretty and good sister.’</p><p>
“Picking their way through the abandoned armor, the beautiful sister and the brother walked back to their settlement.</p><p>
“The retreating cloud seemed quite small. Small, but it held all ten thousand select warriors from Rome running home in horror. They would fall and get up again, and terrified, they would run again.</p><p>
“Don't think there is any mysticism in this, Vladimir, because there isn’t. The Vedruss simply made a decision. On each homestead—and there were more than two hundred in the settlement—each settler opened up ten troughs with bees. Each trough held about fifteen thousand bees. You can figure for yourself how many bees that made in the cloud. When a person is stung many times by bees, he feels a powerful itching at first, and pain. Then a person can fall asleep, and that sleep will be deadly.”</p><p>
</p><p>“In this way, the happy Vedruss went on with their lives, knowing neither war nor disaster. For centuries, they feared no outside enemies. Nonetheless, ancient Russia was conquered when it fell for clever traps and produced a force against itself.”</p><p>
</p><p>Anastasia presented several parables talking about the life of Vedian Rus. Someone else may have information about the life of people of that time in the form of ancient legends. There is no point hoping for manuscript sources because, as we know from history, they were scrupulously destroyed. They were burned in Italy, England, France, and especially zealously in Russia.</p><p>
But those who furiously destroyed the culture of our forefathers were unable to burn it out of the depths of human hearts and souls.</p><p>
</p><p>
We have to know our history. Know and respect it. But we also must understand that Vedism, paganism, and Christianity are all stages in our history. We must not disdain any one of those stages. If we arm ourselves against one of them, we arm ourselves against ourselves once again. We must treat Christianity, and other faiths as well, with understanding and respect. Only then will all the stages of our history be a solid foundation for a beautiful future. But this can happen if we know and understand, if we view the stages of our history as lessons for building the future. Otherwise we will live in a world of the absurd.</p><p>
In several countries, the governments and legislators are fighting terrorism. They are issuing laws banning the kindling of racial and religious hatred. At the same time, these countries officially allow and support religious doctrines in which wide-scale terrorist acts for the achievement of political goals are committed allegedly in God's name.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0722>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>22. Beautiful are the Holidays of the Vedian Rus'</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
To some degree, we can judge Vedian culture as well from the few holidays that have been preserved to the present, where they remain the most beloved and popular among the people, even though they retain only some of their primordial elements. Which holidays are these? New Year's, Shrovetide, and Whitsun. I cite here the only best-known examples among the many.</p><p>
Coming in early June, the Whitsun holiday has undergone the greatest changes. As you know, at the present time, people go to the cemetery on Whitsun, to visit the graves of their relatives.</p><p>
Coming to the cemetery, they fix up the graves and straighten the borders. A great many of them take alcohol with them and have a drink at the graveside, leaving a glass and piece of bread for the deceased. They talk among themselves, recalling the life of the deceased. Many consider it essential to cry at the grave. We can prove that this purely pagan holiday has undergone serious alterations by the following.</p><p>
In Vedian times and afterward during paganism, there were no mournful, sad holidays. Each holiday gave people a charge of positive energy and passed on to youth knowledge of their ancestors.</p><p>
The day of memory in Vedian times differed significantly from today's.</p><p>
There were no cemetery trips, no lamentations by the graves of the deceased.</p><p>
In Vedian times, there weren't any cemeteries at all. The dead were buried on their homesteads, and the burial spot was not marked by a tombstone or vault. A little mound was made, and with the passage of time, it came even with the ground.</p><p>
The Vedruss believed that the best memory of someone should be of what he had done during his lifetime.</p><p>
Knowledge of nature and of the power of human thought led the Vedruss to the conclusion that if all the relatives modeled death in their thoughts, then their thought would not let the soul of the deceased take on flesh.</p><p>
On the day of ancestral remembrance, on the oldest homestead, all the family members gathered in the morning. In their presence, the eldest—as a rule, the grandfather or great-grandfather—walked up to the younger generation and began speaking to them in the following way.</p><p>
"When your papa was the same size as you are now," the grandfather would say, addressing a small grandchild, "he planted this little sapling here. With the passage of time, it has now turned into this big apple tree, which bears fruit." The grandfather would lead the grandson to the apple tree, touch it himself, and the grandson would stroke the apple tree.</p><p>
Then the grandfather would walk up to the other plantings and tell the story of who planted them. All the members of the family could help the grandfather with their memories, telling cheerful stories or speaking about the feelings they experienced.</p><p>
In the end, the members of the family would walk up to the main tree—the family tree—a cedar or oak.</p><p>
"Now this tree," the eldest of the family would continue his story, "was planted by my great-grandfather's great-grandfather."</p><p>
Then they would discuss together why this specific kind of tree was chosen and not another. Why the distant ancestor planted the tree in that very spot, not to the right and not to the left of it. Some would ask questions, and others would answer them. Sometimes a debate began, and it often happened that, in the heat of a debate, one of the children, not noticing it himself, would say something strange: "How can you not understand, I planted this tree here specifically because . . ."</p><p>
The adult members of the family would immediately understand that their little one had entered the soul, the emotions, and the knowledge of a distant ancestor, and they were proud that his soul was not idling in the universal expanses. It had not disintegrated into tiny particles but was continuing to live in perfection, an eternal life.</p><p>
Paganism, to say nothing of Vedism, is hard to call a religion. More correctly, you would regard it as "the culture of a way of life," the greatest culture of a highly spiritual civilization. This civilization did not need to believe in God.</p><p>
The people of this civilization knew God.</p><p>
The people of this civilization interacted with God and understood the Creator's thoughts.</p><p>
The people of this civilization knew the purpose of the grass, the midge, and the planets.</p><p>
The people of this civilization reside even today in our souls. They will definitely wake up— cheerful, joyous creators of our beautiful planet, the children of God—the Vedruss.</p><p>
These are not simply empty words. There is as much proof as you like. One of these is Japan.</p><p>
As we know, in the sixteenth century, Christians began aggressively propagating their ideology in Japan. However, after observing the results of Christian missionaries' activities, Tonugawa Ieyasu, the Japanese ruler of the time, banned Christianity.</p><p>
Even today, Japan is a country closer to paganism, with its national religion of Shintoism.</p><p>
Shintoism, in translation, means "way of the gods." According to Shintoism’s precepts, man's purpose is to exist in harmony with nature.</p><p>
Yet is the Japanese way of life evil and uncivilized? This is exactly how the life of man in the pagan period is interpreted. This is a lie. It's all exactly the opposite.</p><p>
First, many Japanese write poetry and have a loving attitude toward nature. It is Japanese ikebana that the whole world admires. This elegant art is not confined only to Japan's professional florist-artists. You can see ikebana in nearly every Japanese home. The Japanese have a special attitude toward their children. Grownups apply maximum effort to ensure complete freedom for their child.</p><p>
Apparently they are poets and artists, then. But the level of Japanese technology surpasses even the most developed countries. It is hard to compete with them in electronics and automaking. Speaking about a modern pagan country like Japan, we are speaking only of pagan elements. What type of person would there be in a completely pagan culture?</p><p>
The one thing that is clear is that his level of knowledge and spirituality would significantly exceed modern man's. But someone must have a great need to dupe us by suggesting the exact opposite.</p><p>
Japan is neither the exception nor the sole example. Out of the depths of the millennia, names have come to us of such brilliant poets, thinkers, and scholars as Archimedes, Socrates, Democritus, Heraclitus, Plato, and Aristotle, who all lived two hundred to six hundred years before the birth of Christ. Where did they live? In Greece, which was also still a pagan country in those days.</p><p>
Even today, Japan, Greece, Rome, and Egypt, their ancient temple buildings, the art of antiquity, and their holidays and traditions clearly testify to the cultural level of those nations.</p><p>
What can our historians present about ancient Russia of that same period? Nothing.</p><p>
How can we find visible proof of the fact that there lived in Vedian Rus’ people who were artists, poets, and glorious warriors who never attacked anyone but had magnificent mastery of their weapons?</p><p>
I told Anastasia, "If visible proof is not found of the culture of Vedian Rus’, then no one will believe in it. Your stories about it will be viewed as legends—pretty legends, of course, but legends nonetheless. I have been convinced searching for it in the works of historians is pointless. That leaves just you. Can you point to visible proofs, Anastasia?"</p><p>
"Yes, I can, for there are a great many proofs."</p><p>
"Tell me where we need to dig."</p><p>
"Why dig right away? Many human dwellings serve as proof of Vedruss culture."</p><p>
"What dwellings? What do you have in mind?"</p><p>
"Pay attention, Vladimir, to the present-day houses people build, and compare them with the houses built in the village where you now live. Almost all the old houses in that village are decorated with carving. You have also seen even older houses when you visited the museum-city of Suzdal."</p><p>
"Yes, and they were all decorated with even better carving. Not just the houses, but even the gates and fences were works of art."</p><p>
"That means, the more you move into the Russian past, the more beautifully designed the human dwellings you see.</p><p>
"In the museums you can also see the beautiful carving of a decorated spinning wheel, drinking mug, and other utensils in daily use three hundred and five hundred years ago. As you yourself see, Vladimir, the farther back into the ages, the more the masters' art increases.</p><p>
"No country in the world over the span of many centuries has experienced such massive creation by the people. Notice, Vladimir, it is creation by ordinary people, not of individual artists carrying out the orders of rich lords, but absolutely the entire people. Judge for yourself, if you see an ordinary spinning wheel in a museum, you're not seeing the object of a tsar, a tsarina, or some lord. You're seeing an object that was found in every home. All the houses, including the fences, are lovingly adorned with lacy wood carving, all the utensils in the house are decorated, and the clothing is embroidered. This was done not by special master artists; it would have taken an unimaginable number of them. This was done by each Vedruss family independently.</p><p>
“The entire people engaged in creativity. This speaks to the fact that the entire people lived in a sufficiency. You must have time to spend on creativity. Your historians misspeak when they say that in antiquity all people did was toil on their plots of land. If this corresponded to reality, they would not have had time for creativity. But they did. As for the possession of weapons, then judge for yourself: if they could make such beautiful chambers with an ax, then they probably wielded the brush like an artist.</p><p>
“You know what competitions they came up with for Shrovetide entertainment? They dug two tall logs in the ground three meters apart. The two competing men would walk up to these logs. They held an ax in each hand and were blindfolded. They worked with two hands simultaneously, to see who could chop down the log fastest. But this is still not all. They were supposed to chop it down so that it fell exactly next to the log lying next to it.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0723>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>23. Significant Books</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
One day I asked Anastasia's grandfather whether he had ever had occasion to read any religious or scientific books. He gave me a very strange answer.</p><p>
"Only once did I have occasion to pick them up in my own hands, turn the pages, and read the words written in books. But I know everything written in the significant books."</p><p>
"How do you know? And what are significant books? If there are significant books, that means there are also insignificant ones."</p><p>
"There are. But why stuff your head with all that?"</p><p>
"What do you mean why? A cultured, intelligent person should be well read. When I speak at readers' conferences, people sometimes ask me whether I've read one book or another. But I haven't read many books in my life. That's why I'd like to know which books should be read first of all. One life isn't long enough to read everything, even if you read from morning till night. This is why I need to know about the significant books, so I don't look like a complete ignoramus."</p><p>
"You know, Vladimir, when people at your readers' conferences ask you what books you’ve read, you must tell them that you know all the books."</p><p>
"I can't say that if I haven't. People might ask me what some specific author said in his book. If I've never even held the book in my hands, I won't be able to answer anything."</p><p>
"Just tell them, 'This author had nothing substantial to say.' Let whoever drew your attention to that book prove the reverse. Understand, Vladimir, it only seems as if there are such a great many books. In fact, you couldn't come up with ten significant ones."</p><p>
"But how do you define a book's significance?"</p><p>
"Using a criterion."</p><p>
"Can you give me this criterion? At least for a while?"</p><p>
"Of course I can, and I can give it to all your readers, too. The problem is that the criterion of books' significance is people's way of life."</p><p>
"What do you mean, their way of life? What does that have to do with this?"</p><p>
"People live at all ends of the earth. Human communities are conditioned by their countries' differences. The cultures of the peoples of the different countries differ from one another, as does their way of life and longevity. The culture of different nationalities takes shape under the influence of a significant book, among other things. As a rule, this is a book that stipulates the people's philosophy and shapes their type of religion and, consequently, their way of life.</p><p>
"For example, in China the teaching of Confucius is considered important. A special picture of the world has been developing since ancient times in China. Put briefly, it interprets the world as a living system.</p><p>
"Part of this cosmic system are the concepts of yin and yang. If you're interested in the way of life of the Chinese people, if you see in it an example for all humanity, then read the book written by Confucius. If you're interested in the worldview of the Japanese, their life achievements, then read a book that talks about this country's traditional religion, Shintoism, which has significantly shaped the Japanese way of life.</p><p>
"If you believe that the happiest people live in the Christian world, then read the Bible. The significant books are those books which shape a given way of life of a segment of the human community."</p><p>
"But after all, Christianity has a lot of religious literature apart from the Bible itself."</p><p>
"Yes, it does. But there is absolutely nothing new in it. As a rule, each significant book has one or two basic thoughts or philosophical conclusions. All the other books on the same topic simply repeat this thought and do not bring anything new to your worldview.</p><p>
"Here, for example, is one of the basic thoughts of the Bible, the thought that God must be worshiped and his commandments followed. There have been many books after that which talk about how best to do this. Some talk about the necessity of crossing yourself with two fingers, others three; some talk about how best to construct the outside appearance of a temple. They cite hundreds of examples of worship performed in their lifetimes by various religious adherents. They report the wars and debates around ways of worship.</p><p>
"People get bogged down in these debates and lose their ability to determine the main thought.</p><p>
"People cease to compare the main thought with others. In the end, by reading many books about the same thing, they acquire no new information and merely slow their own analytic resources. They don't even attempt to determine whether God really wants worship from man. Perhaps God wants something quite different.</p><p>
"As you see, over the course of two thousand years, the hundreds of thousands of 'religious' books have spoken basically about one and the same thing.</p><p>
"The appearance of a new, well-founded thought about the relationship between God and man means the appearance for the first time in two millennia of a significantly new book. When it appeared, then the previously most significant ones were relegated to the category of historical books."</p><p>
"You're talking about the appearance of a new significant book? What is it called?"</p><p>
"Co-Creation. It contains new thoughts, and they are well founded. The main thought of this book lays out in a precise and well-founded way what God wants from man and what man's mission consists of. You wrote this book from Anastasia's words, and you must remember, Vladimir, what God replied to the question of universal essences: 'What do you want so ardently?' everyone asked, and he replied, confident in his dream, 'Joint creation and joy for all from its contemplation.'"</p><p>
"But how do you prove that this statement is the express desire of God?"</p><p>
"The proof is everywhere: in the sentence itself, in the human heart and soul, in the thought's inner logic. Judge for yourself. If you assume God's creations of earth and man, then God's subsequent emotions will correspond to the emotions of man, the father of his children. Any loving parent desires joint creation with his children.</p><p>
"The second part of the sentence speaks to precisely what kind of creation God desires: 'and joy for all from its contemplation.' Now, you tell me, what kind of creations can bring joy to absolutely everyone?"</p><p>
"It's hard to answer that question. A good automobile brings joy to some; others care nothing about cars. Some like to eat meat; others don't eat meat at all. There's even a popular saying: ‘Every man to his taste.’ You could scarcely find an object that everyone would like."</p><p>
"On the contrary, you can. For example, air, water, flowers. . . ."</p><p>
"But that's already been created, and we're talking about joint creation."</p><p>
"Yes, air, water, and plants have been created. But they can be different. Man can either pollute the air with dust, soot, and toxic gases or fill the air with ethers, fragrances, and flower pollen. Water can be different, too. For example, you can use water that smells of chlorine, or you can drink living water. And among the diversity of plants, you can create a rubbishy chaos, or you can create living scenes of unusual beauty that delight the eye and beckon you. There is a sentence about this in Co-Creation."</p><p>
"If Co-Creation is significant, as you say, then should it change or somehow influence the life of society?"</p><p>
"Yes, such is the law. A new thought must be embodied in a new way of life for society."</p><p>
"But when will this happen? Already two years have passed since it came out."</p><p>
"More precisely, not 'already' but ‘another.' In this relatively short period of time, though, it has created a great deal. You yourself have said that many people are already trying to build a new way of life for themselves. They're even creating programs for organizing the state."</p><p>
"Yes, I did say that, and these manifestations really do exist."</p><p>
"There, you see? It took three hundred years for a palpable manifestation of Christian ideology, and here it's been just two years. Anastasia's thoughts are materializing in many nations’ real way of life and uniting their aspirations into a single creative surge of universal co-creation.</p><p>
“It splashed a new way of thinking into space, and this is an event on a universal scale. Consequently, the book in which these thoughts first were heard will receive a corresponding assessment."</p><p>
"So that means I will be one of the significant writers?"</p><p>
"You will not be merely one of them. You will be the most significant one, Vladimir. My granddaughter would not even dream of a secondary role for her beloved."</p><p>
"That's not quite so. In the popular newspaper Arguments and Facts, they published the books' rating. They put The Family Book in second place in Russia."</p><p>
"Time will pass, and many people will realize the significance of the books you've written. Then first place will simply not be enough for these books. Only six years have passed since you wrote a book for the first time. No one knew you. But today you are not simply famous. I've heard you've been awarded the title of people's academician and a diploma."</p><p>
"Yes. But this is a title from a public academy, not a traditional one."</p><p>
"That's it exactly, a public one. Treasure this title, for it is higher than a traditional one. The people have spoken. Those who have recognized both the significance of what is said in your books and determined your merit have basically understood and appreciated Anastasia's thoughts. The people were able to do this were anything but simple, and they will be able to embody, understand, and realize these thoughts. So it will be. But don't preen. Hold out without pride until it's time."</p><p>
"I'll try. I'll read what Anastasia said once more. Even I realize I'm not going to be reading mysteries or cheap fiction. There really are no special thoughts in them. They're nothing but fun and games. However, this one question remains unclear to me. You can determine a book's significance only after you've read it. But a huge number of books have been written. You walk into a library and there are tens of thousands of books on its shelves. The titles of many are pretentious, up to and including ones like, 'Conversation with God,' 'Discovery of the Truth,' 'All the Secrets of Life.' But in fact, you read and read and there is no new thought in them. Among ten thousand books, there may be one significant one, but the likelihood that I'm going to come across it is one in ten thousand. What should I do?"</p><p>
"That's what I'm telling you. Before reading, look at the life of the planet, choose a situation you like from the life of a people, read their book, and contemplate."</p><p>
"But what if I don't like anything? All people have similar disasters. There are differences, of course, but overall. . . . For example, the environment is deteriorating worldwide."</p><p>
"If you don’t like anything, then think about how to build a life that's noble, and when you decide how, write a book yourself."</p><p>
"Myself? Without reading anything?"</p><p>
"Why do confuse yourself, Vladimir? You yourself say you can't find worthy books. Behind the garishness of the titles there are words without sense or new thought. At the same time, you have doubts. You believe it impossible to be intelligent without reading rubbish. Meanwhile, I'm telling you that every person tries to read the main book from the day they’re born. Its language is distinct from printed letters. You must remember, 'That language has smells and color, too.'"</p><p>
"I see."</p><p>
"Here, read it and contemplate."</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0724>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>24. Teleportation Exercise</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
"Yes, you're right, Vladimir. Given the current consciousness of most people, what Anastasia is creating seems incredible.</p><p>
"Meanwhile, when they achieve the consciousness of inherent in the people of the primary sources, they themselves will find their present-day skepticism ridiculous.</p><p>
"I will now tell you about just one exercise you can use to easily teleport your second 'I'—to transport yourself to the next town, or another country, or another age. Every person can do this if he makes the effort.</p><p>
"Once you saw Anastasia, at your request, move her body in an instant from one shore of the lake to the other. Then she moved it back. She did not hide how man can achieve the same. One must mentally picture all the cells of the body, so tiny that they cannot be seen under a microscope, atomize them in space with your thought, and by the will of your thought collect them all into one, but in a new place. The effect of such a spectacle staggers the imagination.</p><p>
"Such a thing can be done by a person whose speed of thought allows him to picture his body in detail in a single instant. All it takes is a microscopic error and then, after you've atomized, you might not be reassembled.</p><p>
"I have done this just three times in my life, and each time I prepared for it for at least a year. Now, I wouldn’t be able to do that. I've grown older or lazier. But even my granddaughter, who demonstrated her transporting to you so easily, said, 'One should not do this without dire necessity,' and explained why.</p><p>
"Meanwhile, she has transported you more than once to different eras and cities. You have seen scenes and felt yourself present at those events. Have I spoken correctly?"</p><p>
"Yes, you have. I described her transporting me and herself to another planet, without our bodies. Our bodies remained on Earth, and many did not believe this possible."</p><p>
"They will believe when they themselves can do something similar. I'll teach you now. Listen carefully and try to understand what I'm going to say.</p><p>
"A human being builds his essence of energies out of many components. Emotions, thought, and imagination are the human being, too, but these energies cannot be seen. We won't say whether or not these parts of the body exist on a material plane. In this case, their materiality is not that important. More important is something else: that they exist and that they are also you, the human being.</p><p>
"The material human body is one of the many components of a human being. A person may live without a material body as well, but then it would have to be called something else. The material body provides the means to determine the degree of harmony in the balance of all the other energies.</p><p>
"Now imagine that you or someone else by his will took all his energies, the entire complex of them, separated them from the body, and moved them to a different dimension."</p><p>
"Can each person really do that?"</p><p>
"Yes. This happens in part to everyone during sleep. Don't get distracted, however, and listen further. I said: man is capable of moving his entire set of feelings by his will.</p><p>
"All this requires is a little training. Here is a training exercise.</p><p>
"For the training you need to choose a place where no one will disturb you. This could even be an ordinary room or a bed. Sounds distracting you from concentrating should not be allowed to penetrate this room. You lie down on the bed and relax your body. You check to see that your arms, legs, and head are each lying freely and comfortably. Then, without moving, just by your will, try to send more blood to one hand than to other parts of the body. It won't work right away. Repeat it until you feel faint twinges in the tips of the fingers of the hand where you've sent more of your blood and energy. You need to do this for no more than thirty minutes a day, but do it until you can freely direct the flow of energy and blood, at your wish, from one hand to the other and to your feet. When you achieve the desired result, you can send energy to your brain as well.</p><p>
"Someone who has this ability will reap many health benefits. For example, to remove a pimple or sore from a hand, foot, or another part of the body, or to fortify thinning hair. But above all, it can give the brain additional energy. I must also add that in order to achieve this, you must not eat meat for several days before you start the exercise. Your food must be varied, easily digested, and fresh, with ethers. Where you live, it is hard to obtain food like that, but you can get much of what you lack from foods like this: in the morning, take about ten grams of cedar oil, about twenty grams of honey, and about five grams of flower pollen. It is essential to repeat this three hours before going to bed.</p><p>
"When you master the first part of the exercise, you can move on to the second. For this, tell me what daily act does a person perform at home most often?"</p><p>
"Probably cooking food. Of course, every day most people cook food. They peel potatoes, for example."</p><p>
"Choose some action you repeat most often. It doesn't matter what it is, but it must be very familiar to you. You named potato peeling. For some it will be most familiar. Someone else will choose something different.</p><p>
"Now, take a clock and note the time as you begin. While performing the action, try not to think about anything else, and remember the details and your sensations in performing it. For instance, if you’re peeling potatoes, remember how you held the knife, where the peelings fell, how you washed it, and your feelings from the water. Remember how you put the potatoes in the pot and how you put the pot on the flame. Remember what you did when you took out the garbage.</p><p>
"When you decide that your actions are complete, look at the time, and remember or write down how many minutes you spent on your actions—a total of twenty minutes peeling and cleaning up, for example. Take an alarm clock, and set it to go off exactly twenty minutes later. Go to another room, where, lying on the bed, you ran through the first part of the exercise. Lie on the bed, relax, close your eyes, and imagine yourself in the room where you peeled the potatoes.</p><p>
"You have to imagine everything in the minutest detail. If you picture everything correctly, logically, and in detail, the alarm will ring when you complete your imaginings.</p><p>
"If you're lazy and omit a lot of the details, then you will complete your mental imaging before the alarm goes off.</p><p>
"If you're sluggish, slow in your thoughts and imaginings, the alarm will go off before you're done.</p><p>
"A person needs to train like this for a year—perhaps two—but some can learn this in a month. Anyone who learns to do this, whose time in his imagination coincides with real time, closely approaches teleportation and can move on to the third part of the exercise.</p><p>
"In the third part of the exercise, you have to move mentally to another room of your house and perform actions that you do very rarely. Now you note the time of your actions in your imagining. For example, you enter the room, pour water into a pitcher, and water the flowers. When you have finished mentally watering the flowers and get up, look at the clock dial and remember or write down how many minutes your imagining took you.</p><p>
"Go into the room you thought of and this time actually water the flowers . The time should coincide with your meditation down to the minute. A failure to coincide again indicates you need training. When the time does coincide, you can accomplish a great deal with your second 'I' and be not only in a room in your apartment but in the next building or country. All this requires is authentic details. By subjecting them to analysis, you will be able to create an entire environment in detail and be there.</p><p>
"Not everyone will be given this ability, but I can tell you for certain that if you have ever been in a city in a foreign country, you can be there a second and third time by transporting your second 'I.'</p><p>
"He who achieves this must bear in mind a certain danger: you must not separate your second 'I' from your body for long."</p><p>
Here I'll digress and tell you in more detail about the danger.</p><p>
For its own sake, I did these exercises, and once I achieved the results Anastasia's grandfather talked about, I tried to move, or teleport, my second "I" to the town of Pafos, on Cyprus, where I had had once spent some time.</p><p>
I lay down on the couch in my office, relaxed, and imagined myself packing, going to the airport, boarding the plane, flying to the Larnaca airport, and settling into my usual hotel. Then, after taking a shower, I went for a walk in the direction of the sea.</p><p>
Evening coffee, local music, the beach in the morning, swimming in the sea . . .</p><p>
I returned or woke up—I don't know exactly how to put it—three days later. And I could barely get out of bed. My body, to put it mildly, had needed to use the toilet for a long time, but no one had taken it there. It was also hungry, but no one had fed it. I got up with difficulty and looked at myself in the mirror. I did not like my reflection in the mirror. I had a three-day stubble, and I looked hurt and gloomy. I felt very sorry for my body, which had been abandoned for three days. From all that happened, I concluded that a man's body is absolutely helpless flesh without the energy of the second (or maybe the first) human "I." Although it is helpless, it is still very dear and should not be abandoned even for the sake of a trip to a foreign resort. Also, when you travel without your body, the sensation seems complete. You feel the sea water, and the warmth of the sun, but your body doesn’t tan.</p><p>
At first I regretted having spent the time on training. Later, however, I was able to use the opportunity for the good of the cause to see, with the help of my second "I," a few events that had not yet occurred. This is how I wrote a few stories that I will present here.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0725>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>25. Give Children a Homeland</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
In Ukraine, there is a city called Kharkov. In this city there is a children's home. It is a fine children’s home: comfortable buildings, a handsome aquarium, a large pool. The local authorities made an effort and entrepreneurs helped. The director of the municipal office of public education showed me the buildings and told me how the children from this home attend an ordinary school. I looked out the window. The children were coming back from school in groups. Just one little girl was walking apart from everyone else.</p><p>
"That's Sonya. She's in the first grade," the director told me. "She always walks alone. She believes a Jewish family is going to adopt her soon."</p><p>
"Why Jewish? She doesn't look like a Jewish child. She has blond hair and looks more like a Ukrainian."</p><p>
"Someone in school told her that Sonya is a Jewish name, so she's a Jew. Sonya agreed with this nationality and immediately decided she was definitely going to be adopted by a Jewish family. But she walks alone all the time because she thinks that if she walks in the group her future parents won't be able to notice her."</p><p>
There is a fine children's home in Kharkov. There are children's homes in other cities in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. Children live in them. And no matter how comfortable the buildings of these places are, the children dream of having parents, of belonging to a family.</p><p>
Skinny little first-grader Sonya walked her purposeful walk across the asphalt yard, in her gray shoes, separately from the others. And children’s home girl Sonya dreamed.</p><p>
One day passed, then two, then months. Sonya still didn't know that children’s shelters have existed for a long time and in different countries and not all the children get adopted. Indeed, most of them are doomed to live without parents. Sonya was not adopted either.</p><p>
However, her life took an unusual turn. At this same time, a group of people, residents of Kharkov, decided to build a settlement not far from the city. They were able to obtain one hundred fifty hectares of land, and one hundred twenty families, each taking a hectare, were allowed to found their own homesteads.</p><p>
One plot on the edge was left ownerless, and they decided to give it to some children's home child. As it happened, the choice fell on little Sonya. The child was brought by car, along with her instructor, to her plot. The instructor began explaining to the child:</p><p>
"You see, Sonya, stakes have been hammered in and a string strung between them. Behind this string is your land, a whole hectare. It was given to you by people who have also each taken a hectare of land next to you and will be planting gardens and building houses on them. When you grow up, you, too, can build a house and plant a garden. Your land will wait for you."</p><p>
The little girl walked up to the string, touched it, and asked the instructor, "You mean, past this string is my land, and past the string I can do everything I decide myself?"</p><p>
"Yes, dear Sonya, this is your land, and you alone can be in charge of everything that grows on it."</p><p>
"But what will grow on it?"</p><p>
"Well, for now, as you see, there are different grasses growing. But on the neighboring plots, look, people are already planting apple trees and pear trees, and many other fruit trees, and they will soon have blooming orchards. When you grow up, you will decide what to plant where on your land so that it is beautiful the way the others are."</p><p>
Sonya leaned over and crawled under the string onto her own hectare of land, took a few steps along the string, looked closely at the grass and at everything bustling and chirruping in it. She walked up to a small birch tree growing on the parcel allotted to her and touched its still slender trunk. She turned to her instructor and asked, for some reason a little agitatedly, "And the little tree? The birch tree? Is that only mine, too?"</p><p>
"Yes, dear Sonya, the birch tree, too, is now yours since it's growing on your land. When you get older, you can plant other trees here, too, but now it's time for us to go. It will be dinner soon, and I have to be in the group."</p><p>
The girl turned to face her plot and looked at it in silence.</p><p>
</p><p>Those who have children know that, while playing, children often mark off for themselves improvised rooms out of various objects or build shelters in the country and play in them. For some reason, each child has a need to mark out his own small world from the larger world, to create his own dimension. The children in the home have a shared dimension. This shared dimension, even if it is well arranged, has an oppressive effect on them.</p><p>
Sonya, like the other children, had never had her own corner, even a tiny one.</p><p>
Now she stood behind a string where everything was hers alone: the grass, the grasshoppers living in the grass, and the little birch tree. The skinny little girl turned to her instructor. She began to speak in tones of prayer and resolve.</p><p>
"I beg of you, so so much, please, let me stay here. You go, and I'll come back myself."</p><p>
"How will you come back thirty kilometers?"</p><p>
"I will," Sonya answered firmly. "I'll walk and I'll get there. Maybe I'll take a bus. Please, let me stay on my land alone."</p><p>
The Zhiguli's driver, also an owner of a plot of land near Sonya's, heard the conversation and made a suggestion.</p><p>
"Let the girl stay here until this evening. I'll take you back and get her home this evening."</p><p>
After thinking it over, the instructor agreed. She couldn't help but agree because she looked at the face of the little girl standing behind the string awaiting her decision.</p><p>
"Fine, Sonya. You can stay here until evening. I'll send your dinner with the driver."</p><p>
"There's no need to send it. The neighbor woman and I share dinner," the Zhiguli driver said seriously, respectfully pronouncing the words "neighbor woman."</p><p>
"Listen, Klava," he shouted to them woman busy over dinner on the porch of a house under construction. "Make dinner for four; we'll have our neighbor with us today."</p><p>
"Fine," the woman answered. "There's enough for everyone." And she added, "Sonya, you be sure to come to me if you need anything."</p><p>
"Thank you," the perfectly happy Sonya replied.</p><p>
After the Zhiguli left, Sonya walked along the string strung between the stakes. She walked slowly, sometimes stopping, sitting in the grass, touching something with her little hands, and walking again. In this way, she walked the perimeter of her entire parcel of land.</p><p>
Then she stood in the middle of the hectare and surveyed all the sides of its boundary. And suddenly spreading her arms wide, she ran, jumped, and spun.</p><p>
After dinner, seeing how tired the little girl was, Klava suggested that she nap on a cot, but the weary Sonya replied, "If you can, give me some old clothing to spread out. I'll sleep on my own land, next to the birch tree."</p><p>
Nikolai set up a cot with a mattress and blanket next to the birch tree on Sonya's plot. The girl lay down and immediately fell into a deep sleep. This was her first slumber on her own homestead.</p><p>
What struck everyone at first as an insoluble problem arose at the children's home. Every day, Sonya asked the instructors to allow her to go to her hectare of land. Explanations that she was still too little to take the bus herself and the instructors couldn't take her because they couldn't leave the other children didn't help.</p><p>
Sonya began talking to the children's home's director. She explained to the director that she absolutely had to go to her land—had to because the people on the neighboring parcels were already planting trees, and they would soon have orchards blooming, while her land looked abandoned. Nothing was going to bloom on it.</p><p>
In the end, the home's director found an acceptable solution for Sonya.</p><p>
"Right now we can't take you to your parcel, Sonya, since, apart from everything else, you still have two weeks of study to go. In two weeks, vacation begins, and I will speak with your neighbors. If they agree to look after you, then during the vacation we will send you off to spend time on your parcel, for a week or maybe more. By the way, you could spend these two weeks to the benefit of your land. Take these two brochures and read them. One talks about how to make fences and the other about the varieties of medicinal plants. If you behave well, I will also get you various seeds in time for the vacation.</p><p>
Sonya behaved well. She did her lessons assiduously, and all—absolutely all—of her free time she spent reading the two brochures given her by the director. When she went to bed she imagined, pictured, how prettily the different plants would grow on her parcel. One day, when all the children slept, the night aide noticed Sonya drawing trees and flowers in the moonlight that came through the window.</p><p>
Her neighbors agreed to look after the girl, and when the summer vacation came, the director himself helped load food supplies for two weeks, a shovel, a small rake, and a packet of seeds into the Zhiguli's trunk.</p><p>
Nikolai didn't want to take the food from the children's home, but the director told him that Sonya was an independent girl and would never want to be a burden to anyone and that it would be better if she saw that she had her own food.</p><p>
She was also given a new sleeping bag, even though the family of her neighbor Nikolai had prepared a small room and bed for the girl on the now finished first floor of their house.</p><p>
When Sonya got in the car, not only the children's home staff working that day but also many people who had come especially to see the girl's face beaming with happiness, saw her off.</p><p>
The first three nights Sonya slept in the room set aside for her in her neighbor's house, and she spent the entire day on her own hectare of land.</p><p>
The third day was Nikolai's birthday, and many guests came to see him. One young couple came with their tent. The next day the guests left, but the tent stayed.</p><p>
"This is a present for you," the young people told Nikolai.</p><p>
Sonya went up to Nikolai and asked to sleep in the tent. Nikolai gave his permission.</p><p>
"Of course, sleep there if you want to so badly. Is it stuffy for you in the room?"</p><p>
"It's nice in the room," the girl replied, "but everyone is sleeping on their own land, and mine is left all alone at night. There are lights on many parcels, and mine is dark."</p><p>
"You're saying you want me to move the tent and set it up on your parcel?"</p><p>
"Very much, Uncle Kolya, next to the birch tree. If you have the time, and if it's not too hard."</p><p>
All the following nights, Sonya slept in the tent pitched next to the birch tree on her hectare.</p><p>
Waking early in the morning, she immediately went over to the water bucket by her tent, scooped out a mug of water, and taking some into her mouth, released a thin stream of water into her open hands and washed up.</p><p>
Then she took the album in which she had drawn herself the pictures of her ideal garden on the parcel and examined them. Then she went to make her flowerbeds and fences.</p><p>
The small digging tool given her by the children's home director was certainly sharp, but Sonya just could not push it all the way into the ground; she only had the strength to get it in halfway. However, her fences were turning out anyway.</p><p>
Her neighbor Nikolai offered to dig up the places Sonya showed him on her hectare with his rototiller, but Sonya categorically refused. In general, she reacted jealously to any incursion on her hectare. People sensed this and tried not to cross the border marked out by stakes and the lines strung between them without the girl's knowledge. Even her neighbor Nikolai, when he woke up in the morning to call Sonya to breakfast, only went as far as the string and called to Sonya from there.</p><p>
Some very unusual aspiration of the little girl for independence, or fear of being a burden to anyone, would not allow her to ask for anything, and even when one of the residents of the settlement tried to offer her clothing, or candy, or some other supply, she politely thanked them but categorically refused to take anything.</p><p>
In the two weeks she spent on her land, Sonya dug, put in three fences, and made a large flowerbed in the middle.</p><p>
On the morning of the last day of Sonya's two-week stay on her land, Nikolai came as usual to the border of her parcel to call her to breakfast.</p><p>
The little girl was standing next to her flowerbed, where nothing had come up yet, looked at it, and without turning around, answered, "Uncle Kolya, you don't need to call me to meals today. I don't want to eat today."</p><p>
Nikolai would say that he sensed a certain anguish in the girl's voice and barely restrained sobs, but he did not try to discover what had happened. He went back home and began observing Sonya through his binoculars.</p><p>
The little girl was walking around her parcel, touching the plants, and straightening the fences. Then she went to her birch tree, put her arms around it, and her little shoulders shook.</p><p>
The children's home old minivan came for Sonya just before dinner. The driver stopped by the entrance to Nikolai's homestead and honked. Nikolai recounted what happened then.</p><p>
"When I watched her through my binoculars collecting her modest things, the spade and the rake, and head downcast in our direction, when I saw her face through the binoculars, I couldn't stand it and grabbed my mobile phone. It's a good thing I was able to reach the children's home director right away. I told him I would sign any documents and accept responsibility for the child. I would take leave and be on the parcel all the time, just so the little girl could be on her hectare to the end of vacation.</p><p>
"At first the director began to explain that all the children from their children's home were supposed to go for treatment and rest to a seaside children's camp. The home had been trying for this opportunity a long time, and now the children were going, thanks to their sponsors. I said something brusque to the director, but he did not take offense and responded equally curtly. Then he added, 'Give the driver the phone, and tomorrow I'll come myself.'</p><p>
"I ran out, gave the driver the phone, and told him, 'Go on, friend, get going quickly.'</p><p>
"The driver left. Sonya, who had come up, asked, 'Uncle Kolya, was that our van coming for me? But why did it leave?'</p><p>
"For some reason, I was powerfully upset from my negotiations with the director. I lit a cigarette. My hands were shaking, and I said to her, 'Well yes, they were here for you. They just came to ask whether you needed any food or anything else, and I told him we would get along.'</p><p>
"She looked at me closely, and I thought she understood something, and she said quietly, 'Thank you, Uncle Kolya.' She started back again, and then ran quickly to her land.</p><p>
"The children’s home director arrived in the morning, but I was already waiting for him. However, he went straight to the tent and not to see me. I didn't have time to tell him he had crossed the string without an invitation, but he did well and guessed himself. He also did well, obviously, not to traumatize the child. He said as soon as the girl came out to meet him, 'Good day, Sonya. I came by just to ask you something. We're going to the sea. What about you? Will you stay here or go to the sea with us?'</p><p>
"'Here,' Sonya didn't say, but shouted.</p><p>
"'That's what I thought,’ the director replied. 'That's why I brought you by way of food supplies . . .'</p><p>
"'You mustn't worry or waste your time. I don't need anything.'</p><p>
"'You don't? What would you have me do then? The state gives us money for each pupil, and you're going to raise yourself here and feed yourself. How would you have me account for the state money in that situation? No, you must take it, be so kind. Come on, Alexeich, unload it. Allow us to enter, Sonya. Maybe you'll show me what you've been doing?'</p><p>
"For a while Sonya looked at the director, trying to make full sense of the situation. Then she saw the van driver unloading heavy bags, and when she finally realized she was going to stay on her land until the end of vacation, she exclaimed joyfully, 'Oh, what am I doing? Come in. Here's the little gate, there's no string here. Please, be my guest. I will show you what I've been doing. And you, Uncle Kolya, come in.'</p><p>
"She led us to her tent and immediately offered us water to drink from the bucket standing by the tent.</p><p>
"'Here is the water. I get it from the spring. It tastes good, better than from the tap. Drink some, please.'</p><p>
"'I won't refuse,' the director replied, and scooping out half a mug, drank it with pleasure. 'It's good.'</p><p>
"I, too, had a drink, and so did the driver, and we praised Sonya's water, to her great satisfaction. Probably for the first time in her life, Sonya possessed something all her own. Even if it was just water, it was hers, and for the first time she could give something all her own to grownups. Sonya had begun to feel that she was part of the world. Then for an hour and a half, maybe even two, we listened to Sonya's enthusiastic story about what she had already planted and what she planned to plant. She showed us her drawings of her future homestead. Only there was no little house in her drawing plans.</p><p>
"'Time for us to go,' the director told Sonya. 'You can unpack these things here yourself. I also brought you a battery-powered lamp. It can light for distance, but if you switch the lamp to daylight, then you can read. And now you will have something to read. I have brought you magazines on designing land and books on growing everything and on folk medicine.'</p><p>
"'Oh, how could I forget again!' Sonya threw her hands up. 'I'll be right back.'</p><p>
"She folded back the tent flap and we saw bundles of different herbs hanging on a string stretched across the tent. She took several bundles and held them out to the director.</p><p>
"'This is celandine. It's a kind of herb. This is for Katya from our group. She needs to brew it and drink it. She's sick a lot. I read about it in the brochure you gave me. I dried it.'</p><p>
"'Thank you.'</p><p>
"All in all, this director is a good man and loves the children. Later, he and I talked, and he asked me about Sonya's behavior and gave me some practical advice.</p><p>
"Sonya spent the whole summer in the tent on her hectare of land. Her flowerbed bloomed in the middle with beautiful flowers. Onions, radishes, and other things came up in her beds.</p><p>
"In the evenings, when the days started getting shorter, you could often observe the light of the lamp flickering in the tent under the birch. Every evening, Sonya read the books on folk medicine and kept drawing in her album the future of her land.</p><p>
"When at the end of the summer the old van came to take her back to the children's home, I helped load Sonya's supplies. There was quite a lot to load. She had dried two hundred or so bundles of herbs. A sack of potatoes, three melons—we really loaded up that van. I asked her, 'What about next year? Should I hold onto your tent?'</p><p>
"'I'll definitely come for the next vacation. I'll come to my land the very first day. Thank you for being such a good neighbor, Uncle Kolya!'</p><p>
"She held out her hand, now much stronger, to shake. Over the summer, too, Sonya herself not only had tanned but also had become stronger and more self-confident.</p><p>
"She came the next year with fruit tree saplings and some seedlings and immediately got down to work.</p><p>
"At an assembly, the people of our settlement decided to build Sonya a little house.</p><p>
"Zina, the wife of an entrepreneur who had built the largest house, began to insist it not be small.</p><p>
"'I'd be ashamed to look people in the eye. Everyone in the settlement is laying foundations for palaces, and the one and only child is living in a tent. Guests come and who knows what they think of us.'</p><p>
"Knowing the little girl's ways and her sensitivity to any kind of charity, they assigned me to negotiate with her about building a house.</p><p>
"I went to see her and said, 'Sonya, at an assembly, the people of our settlement decided to build you a little house. You just tell us where to put it.'</p><p>
"She asked me rather guardedly, 'Uncle Kolya, how much will a small house cost?'</p><p>
"Suspecting nothing, I replied, 'Two hundred thousand, more or less, two thousand per family.'</p><p>
"'Two thousand? But that's a great deal of money. That means people will buy less for their own children. They'll be spending money on me. Uncle Kolya, I beg of you, tell the people I don't need a house yet. I still haven't even decided where to put it. I beg you, Uncle Kolya, explain it to the people, please.'</p><p>
"She was upset, and I understood why. Having been given her own hectare, Sonya felt independent for the first time in her life. It took the place of parents for her, it needed her, and she it. By some inner instinct, the girl felt and imagined that her land wouldn't want a stranger to touch it.</p><p>
"And God forbid anyone should reproach her after the house was built, even with a silent reproach to Sonya. Her own independence was more precious to her than a house of her own.</p><p>
"I began trying to persuade them not to force any gifts on the girl. And soon after, something unexpected happened. Children ran from the lake past Sonya's parcel, and in the lead on a fancy bicycle was Edik, the entrepreneur's son. He was always teasing Sonya, calling her Shorty, even though he himself was just three years older.</p><p>
"'Hey, Shorty,' Edik shouted to Sonya. 'Still busy with your landscape design? Aren't you tired of it? Why don't we go see the spectacle?'</p><p>
"'What spectacle?' Sonya asked.</p><p>
"'My papa is going to burn down his construction hut now. See over there? The fire engine's already come, just in case.'</p><p>
"'Why burn it down?'</p><p>
"'Because it's spoiling the view.'</p><p>
"'But after it burns, nothing will grow on the land for a long time.'</p><p>
"'Why not?'</p><p>
"'Because all the helpful worms and all the bugs will burn up. Look, I lit a fire near my tent, and now nothing's growing on that spot.'</p><p>
"'Wow! You're very observant, Shorty. So save our worms. Take the old trailer, or else my papa won't know where to dump it.'</p><p>
"'How can I take it? Isn't it heavy?'</p><p>
"'How? How? With a crane, of course. There's a crane coming here the day after tomorrow. To put up a windmill. Basically, take it away or the there's going to be a very grand bonfire here now.'</p><p>
"'Okay, Edik, I agree to take your trailer.'</p><p>
“‘Let’s go, then.’</p><p>
"The grownup neighbors and lots of the children had gathered by the homestead of Edik's parents. The fire crew stood at the ready. Right then Edik walked up to his father, who was walking toward the construction hut with a canister of gasoline and said, to the displeasure of the kids and the joyous amazement of the grownups, 'Papa, you don't have to burn down the trailer.'</p><p>
"'What do you mean I don't? Why is that?'</p><p>
"'Because I gave it away.'</p><p>
"'Who to?'</p><p>
"'Shorty.'</p><p>
"'What Shorty?'</p><p>
"'You know, Sonya, from the last parcel.'</p><p>
"'Really? She agreed? She agreed to take it from you?'</p><p>
"'Papa, if you don't believe me, you can ask her yourself.'</p><p>
"Edik took Sonya by the hand from the midst of the crowd of children, and led her to his father.</p><p>
"'Tell him you agree to take the hut. Tell him.'</p><p>
"'I agree,' Sonya replied quietly.</p><p>
"The entrepreneur couldn't hide his bursting pride in his son. This was wonderful. Willful Sonya wouldn't take anything from anyone and agreed to take a present only from his Edik.</p><p>
"When the kids had scattered, the entrepreneur called over the entire crew working on finishing his house, and he told them, 'Use any materials, work around the clock. I'll pay double, but I want there to be a Euro apartment inside this hut in two days. The outside can be peeling. But inside . . .'</p><p>
"Two days later, on Sonya's parcel, next to the birch tree, on the spot where her tent had been, the peeling construction trailer had been placed on a brick foundation. It was peeling but had been prepped by the builders for painting, and the Finnish paint and brushes were inside.</p><p>
"Sonya painted it herself later—the first house of her own in her life, standing on her own land. The next year, this house was transformed into a fairytale cottage, entwined with ivy and wild grapes and surrounded by blooming flowerbeds.</p><p>
</p><p>Ten years passed. Sonya had graduated and had been living on her own homestead for a year. Houses had gone up in the settlement, which was drowning in greenery and blooming gardens, but Sonya had the very best, most beautiful plot of all. When her classmates left the children's home, retreating into oblivion, trying to matriculate at some educational institute, just so it had a dormitory, to find some kind of job, just so they would have enough to feed themselves, Sonya was already a wealthy person. The settlement's residents gave their excess fruits and vegetables to a manager. The crop yield from the homesteads was bought up at a fairly high price and exported to countries of the European Union, to special stores selling organic food. Sonya, too, gave the manager what she had raised on her homestead, although most of her produce went to people who came to her directly from the city, having heard about the unusual girl and her marvelous homestead.</p><p>
Sonya also gathered medicinal herbs and helped cure many people of illnesses.</p><p>
One day, Edik came to visit his parents, who now lived on their homestead year-round. He had studied at a prestigious American university for three years. He faced a difficult medical operation. The overseas water and food had probably created problems with his liver and kidneys. Before the operation, Edik decided to spend a week with his parents.</p><p>
Zinaida, Edik's mother, suggested, "Son, maybe we should go see our local healer. Maybe she can help."</p><p>
"Oh, Mama, what century are we living in? There, in the West, medicine has long been at the highest level. The diseased tissue needs to be cut out and replaced. Don't worry. I'm not going to any of those old medicine women. That's the century before last."</p><p>
"I'm not suggesting you go to any old women. Remember the little girl from the children's home at the edge of our village who to everyone's amazement herself worked the hectare of land given her? Let's go see her."</p><p>
"You mean Shorty? I vaguely remember."</p><p>
"She's no shorty now, son, but a highly respected person. Managers are prepared to pay her double for what she raises with her own hands, and people come from faraway places for her herb harvests, even though she puts out no advertising whatsoever."</p><p>
"How does Shorty know so much?"</p><p>
"Since first grade she was brought to her plot every summer, and every winter she read different books every day on agriculture and folk medicine. The child's mind is keen and absorbs everything well. She has gleaned a great deal from books, of course. Only people say she has understood more by herself. They also say she understands plants. She talks to them."</p><p>
"How about that Shorty! How much does she charge for treatment?"</p><p>
"Sometimes she charges, but sometimes she treats people for free. Last fall I met her near the pond. She looked into my eyes and said, 'Auntie Zina, there's something wrong with the whites of your eyes. Take this herb, make an infusion, and drink it. It will pass.' And it did. The whites of my eyes really did have something wrong because my liver did. Now it doesn't. Come, son, let's go. Maybe she will help your liver, too."</p><p>
"Only it's not just my liver, Mama. I already have a diagnosis. They're going to remove a kidney. None of your infusions are going to help here. Actually, let's go. It will be interesting to see Shorty's homestead. People say it's like heaven."</p><p>
</p><p>"Yes! She's done a great job," Edik said, unable to restrain his admiration, as he and his mother approached Sonya's homestead. While the people in the settlement were putting all their efforts into building houses and stone walls, she was creating a true paradise. Look at the fence she grew from greenery, Mama!"</p><p>
"If you saw her orchard, you would admire her even more, but she lets very few people into her orchard," Zinaida remarked.</p><p>
She opened the gate slightly and called out loudly, "Sonya, if you're home, come out. Sonya, are you home?"</p><p>
The door of the little house—the former construction shed—opened, and a young woman came out on the front step. With a smooth gesture she put her tight dark blond braid behind her shoulder. She saw Zinaida accompanied by her son, and her cheeks flushed rosily. She buttoned the top button of her blouse, which swathed her firm breast, and with a soft, light, and at the same time graceful gait, the young beauty went down the stairs and headed down the path toward the gate, where Zinaida and Edik were standing.</p><p>
"Hello, Auntie Zina. Welcome, Eduard. Come into my house or orchard, if you like."</p><p>
"Thank you for the invitation. We would be pleased to come in," Zinaida replied.</p><p>
But Edik said nothing, not even hello.</p><p>
"You know, Sonya," Zinaida continued talking on the way to the orchard, "my son has a problem and he faces an operation. Although they will operate on him in America, still, I'm worried, as a mother, somehow."</p><p>
Sonya stopped, turned, and asked Edik, "What hurts you, Eduard?"</p><p>
"My heart," Edik replied in a constrained voice.</p><p>
"What do you mean your heart?" Zinaida exclaimed. "You told me it was your liver and kidney. You mean you lied to reassure me?"</p><p>
"I didn't lie. But now my heart is pounding, Mama. Here, feel how it's pounding." He took his mother's hand and pressed it to his chest. "Listen, it's going to burst if you don't convince this young beauty to marry me this instant."</p><p>
"What a joker," Zinaida laughed. "You nearly frightened your mother to death."</p><p>
"I'm not joking, Mama," Edik replied seriously.</p><p>
"Well, if you're not joking," Zinaida continued gaily, "then know that half the settlement has already sent their matchmakers to see Sonya for their sons. But all without result. She doesn't want to marry. Go ask her why she doesn't, and stop misleading your mother."</p><p>
Edik walked up to Sonya and asked her quietly, "Sonya, why don't you want to marry anyone?"</p><p>
"Because," Sonya answered quietly, "because I was waiting for you, Edik."</p><p>
"You jokers, why are you making fun of a mother?"</p><p>
"Bless us, Mama, immediately. I'm not joking," Edik said firmly, and he took Sonya's hand.</p><p>
"I'm not joking either, Auntie Zina," Sonya said seriously.</p><p>
"You're not joking. . . . You mean, you, too, Sonya . . . You're not joking. . . . So, if you're not joking, why are you calling me auntie instead of mama?"</p><p>
"Fine. I will call you mama," Sonya answered in a trembling voice, and taking a step toward Zinaida, she stopped in hesitation.</p><p>
Zinaida could not make sense right away of what had happened. Was it a trick? A joke? She gravely shifted her gaze from Sonya's face to her son's and back again. At some point she understood the seriousness of the young people's intentions, and when she did, she rushed to Sonya, embraced her, and began to weep.</p><p>
"Sonya, dear Sonya, dear daughter. I realize you're serious."</p><p>
Sonya's shoulders began to tremble as she pressed close to Zinaida, and she repeated, "Yes, Mama, I'm serious. Yes, very serious."</p><p>
Then the young people took each other's hand, and slowly, not noticing anyone around them, started down the streets of the settlement to the homestead of Edik's family. Ahead of them walked Zinaida. She was laughing and crying simultaneously and chattering nonstop, running up to everyone she met.</p><p>
"We arrived. . . . And right away, they fell in love. . . . And right away, I blessed them. . . . But first I thought it was a joke. But right away, they fell in love. And I told them. . . . And they said to me, A wedding, Mama, today. Good people, how can this be? We have to prepare, it has to be official. We can't do things this way."</p><p>
When her husband, an entrepreneur, Edik's father, came out and heard approximately the same incoherent story from her, he looked at the young people and said, "Oh, you're always rattling on, Zinaida. What does that mean? Why can't we have a wedding today? Just look at these young people. We don't need to have a wedding today, we need to right now."</p><p>
Edik walked up to his father and embraced him.</p><p>
"Thank you. Papa."</p><p>
"Come now. . . . Thank you. Come now, embrace! We need to shout 'It's bitter!' so your kiss can make it sweet."</p><p>
"It's bitter! Bitter!" shouted the people who had gathered around.</p><p>
In front of the settlement's inhabitants, Edik and Sonya kissed for the first time. All the settlement residents who were at home at that moment gathered for the wedding. They all set an improvised table in the open air together. The wedding wasn't rowdy, as can happen at Russian drinking parties, but they sang late into the night.</p><p>
Despite the parents' attempts at persuasion, the newlyweds settled not in their palace of a house but in Sonya's small home.</p><p>
"You have to understand, father," Edik said. "We built a palace here with different outbuildings on half the hectare. But it doesn't have the beauty Sonya's homestead does, and we don't have the air. We should take down half of it."</p><p>
The entrepreneur went off to drink for a week. But to everyone's amazement, he began taking down the outbuildings, while repeating over and over, "We were fools to build this here, and now our grandchildren won't want to move into catacombs like this.</p><p>
“A happy life for Sonya and Edik. . . .</p><p>
“Stop! I've already begun talking about the future, and it will definitely be beautiful. But what about the present? In the present, there is a good children's home in Kharkov, and little Sonya is in it. Sonya has entered third grade, but she does not have a hectare of her own land, nor do Tanya, Seryozha, and Katya, and the other hundreds of thousands of children in children's homes. The Ukrainian parliament has still not put the issue on its agenda as to whether to give the residents of their country, including orphan children, a hectare of land to set up a homestead. Nor has the Belarusian parliament, or the Russian. Will their children forgive them? Will today's deputies be able to forgive themselves?</p><p>

</p><p>
Nikolai Ivanovich, the head of a high-security penal colony—simply put, a prison—has not left his office on time for five nights. When the work day ends, he turns off his phone and paces around his office in contemplation, back and forth. Sometimes he sits down at his desk, picks up a green folder, and rereads its contents for the umpteenth time.</p><p>
In the name of a group of convicts locked up in cell no. 26, a prisoner serving a sentence under Article 931* of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation has come to him with a suggestion that is at first glance inconceivable.</p><p>
* Russian Federation law, dated July 21, 1993, in the version dated March 9, 2001, "On institutions and agencies implementing criminal punishments in the form of incarceration." — Editor's note.</p><p>
</p><p>
The prisoner, whose name is Khodakov, has suggested taking a hundred acres of abandoned or unused pasture land, surround this land with barbed wire, and erect towers at the corners—basically, do everything you're supposed to prevent escape. On these hundred fenced-in hectares, ninety prisoners would work, farming. The applications from those wishing to do this were in this folder.</p><p>
These prisoners, by their statements, were obligating themselves to provide vegetables for the entire colony, giving up half the crop they raise for the colony's needs. They asked that the other half be given to their families. There was nothing impossible in this yet. In different colonies the prisoners worked in production. At some they make something simple in woodworking shops; in others, sewing workshops were organized, and the prisoners sewed simple things, like vests and trousers, and received a small wage for their labor—small also because their labor was not very productive.</p><p>
The proposal in the folder was this: the prisoners wanted to farm. Well, that could be done, too. Payment for half the harvest was possible. They didn't have to work at a loss. They could put their output up for sale, and then live for months on the money allocated. But then, after that . . .</p><p>
Prisoner Khodakov, in the name of the other prisoners, asked that the hundred acres be divided into one-hectare plots and each plot be assigned to a specific prisoner.</p><p>
Then he proposed that each prisoner be given the opportunity to build a single cell on the plot allocated to him.</p><p>
At the end of their sentence, those who wanted to stay on their plot could ask for that opportunity and have their surplus harvest purchased, not levied, and prisoners who served their sentence would be given the opportunity to expand their cells.</p><p>
The green folder with this proposal or request had been passed on to Nikolai Ivanovich six months before. Apart from the ninety statements and the text of the proposal, the folder contained a plan for the future plots beautifully rendered in colored pencil. The drawings depicted the guard towers, the barbed wire, and the checkpoint.</p><p>
After an initial reading, Nikolai Ivanovich had put the folder in his bottom desk drawer, and from time to time he returned mentally to its content, but he had not given the prisoners an answer.</p><p>
Something had happened, however, that had forced the colony's director to give intensive thought to the prisoners' proposal every day for five nights running.</p><p>
The situation was the following. An order had come from his superiors as of the following year to begin to expand the colony, build additional cells, and be prepared by the end of the next year to accept another one hundred fifty convicts. With the order came a plan for adding on to existing buildings, as well as financing timelines. The plan proposed using prison labor in the construction.</p><p>
Nikolai Ivanovich reasoned as follows: "The financing is going to be held up, as always, and there is a problem with cheap materials. They do the estimates on one set of building material costs, and when you start the construction they're different. Prisoner labor is not very productive. The order obviously cannot be carried out. But I can't not carry it out. I have five years to go until the end of my service. I've risen to the rank of colonel. I've been colony director for twenty years, and not a single reprimand. And here you have an impossible order."</p><p>
But these circumstances were not the chief ones in the colonel's contemplations. The green folder! In his memo, prisoner Khodakov had asserted that, according to his plan, in its confinement of the prisoners, the main objective of such institutions would be met—the rehabilitation of criminals.</p><p>
The fact that modern correctional facilities did not rehabilitate criminals but rather quite the opposite—honed their criminal skills—Nikolai Ivanovich knew well. Otherwise, they would not be getting second and third sentences. This last seriously preyed on Nikolai Ivanovich's mind, since he had given so much of his time and effort to his service.</p><p>
Life was passing by, his service was coming to an end, and what had he done? Apparently, he had raised criminals.</p><p>
The green folder! There's the rub. If only he could be firmly convinced of its unacceptability, but no, something inside him would not let him reject it. Yet he couldn't be convinced of it either. It was an unusual, unconventional proposal.</p><p>
First thing the following morning, the colonel ordered that prisoner Khodakov of cell no. 26 be brought to his office.</p><p>
"You may sit down, citizen Khodakov." Nikolai Ivanovich pointed to a chair as the prisoner entered under guard.</p><p>
"I've just been going through the contents of your folder. I have a specific question for you."</p><p>
"Yes sir, citizen director," the prisoner said quickly, rising from his chair.</p><p>
"Sit down!" the guard ordered.</p><p>
"Yes, you sit down. No need to jump up as if you were on trial," the colony's director said calmly, and turning to the guard added, "You can wait outside the door for now.</p><p>
"So, Sergei Yurievich Khodakov, you are submitting this strange proposal here?"</p><p>
"It only looks strange at first glance. In fact, the proposal is quite rational."</p><p>
"Then tell me right away, bluntly, what ruse have you dreamed up? Are you trying to create the conditions for a mass escape? Among your ninety statements, each has a sentence of from five to nine years. So you want to bring your freedom closer?"</p><p>
"If there is any ruse in this proposal, then it is unconnected with escape, citizen director." The prisoner rose again and became agitated. "You have misunderstood me."</p><p>
"You must sit calmly. And let's drop the 'citizen director.' Call me Nikolai Ivanovich. I know from your file that you are Sergei Yurievich. You were a psychologist. You defended your dissertation and then went into business. You were convicted of grand larceny, right?"</p><p>
"I was convicted. . . . Nikolai Ivanovich, at the beginning of perestroika things were . . . Before you could get used to certain laws, others went into effect. . . ."</p><p>
"Oh, all right, we're not talking about that now. Clarify your idea of this agricultural zone behind barbed wire, or what else could we call it?"</p><p>
"I'll try to clarify it, Nikolai Ivanovich. Only it's hard for me to do that for a certain reason."</p><p>
"Which is?"</p><p>
"You understand, we've read a book. It's called Anastasia. And then another book, the continuation. Basically, the book talks about man's purpose. About how if each person took a hectare of land and created a heavenly corner on it, the whole earth would be transformed into a paradise. The book speaks simply and convincingly about this."</p><p>
"How could it be simpler? If each person took it and created something, then of course the whole earth would be transformed. Only what does this have to do with you?"</p><p>
"That's what I'm telling you. It's all set out convincingly in those books. Someone who has read them quickly might not understand everything. We have time. We have read, discussed, and understood them."</p><p>
"Well, and what of it?"</p><p>
"After reading these books, many people will want to acquire land and create their own heavenly oasis on their own land. They are at liberty, and this is within their reach. That's why we decided that even though we're behind barbed wire, we, too, could each take a hectare, work on it, and beautify it. By way of punishment, we could give up half or even most of our output for the needs of the colony or society. But we have a request, that this plot not be taken away from us when we finish out our sentence, if we want to stay on it."</p><p>
"What's this, so you're going to live out your life behind barbed wire, under the guards' rifle barrels?"</p><p>
"When everyone's sentence ends, you can remove the barbed wire fence and move them and the towers to another place. Settle new prisoners wishing to establish their own homestead in a new place, so we can stay where we are."</p><p>
"Aha. And then their sentence will run out, the barbed wire and towers go to a new place, and they remain in their free homesteads. Right?"</p><p>
"Yes, that's right."</p><p>
"This is some kind of fantasy! Do you think that I, the colony's director, am going to create heavenly oases for my prisoners? Do you believe something like this can happen?"</p><p>
"I’m absolutely certain of success. As a psychologist, I'm certain, and I feel it with my heart. Judge for yourself, Nikolai Ivanovich. A man serves his nine years and is released. He has no friends. His friends are in exile and in cells. Neither his family nor society at large needs him. Who would want to give a good job to a former prisoner? Plenty are unemployed who have different professions. People are lining up at job exchanges who have fine work histories. A former prisoner has no prospects in society. There is only one way: to take up where he left off. And he does, and he ends up back with you."</p><p>
"I know. You’re stating the obvious. Tell me, as a psychologist, why have prisoners who have read these books suddenly changed and decided to take land even behind barbed wire?"</p><p>
"The prospect of eternity has opened up for each one. People seem to think a man is still living even in a cell. In fact, he isn't. He's dead. Because he has no prospect for life."</p><p>
"What is this prospect of eternity?"</p><p>
"I'm telling you, it's hard for me to set out everything in the books at once."</p><p>
"Fine, I'll read the books and sort out what kind of lyric has inspired you. Then we'll talk. Guard, take him away."</p><p>
Prisoner Khodakov rose, put his hands behind his back, and asked, "May I ask one more question?"</p><p>
"Go ahead," the colonel said.</p><p>
"When we developed the plan for this zone, we took into account existing instructions on detention of prisoners. There are no violations of the instructions in the plan."</p><p>
"Great, you took the instructions into consideration. . . . No violations. . . . I'll check.”</p><p>
"Take him away," Nikolai Ivanovich told the guard.</p><p>
Then he called in the lawyer, handed him the folder, and said, "Here, take this. Familiarize yourself with it and determine whether it contains violations of the instructions for detention, and report in two days."</p><p>
Two days later the lawyer was sitting in the colony director's office. He began his report with language unusually streamlined for a lawyer.</p><p>
"The problem is, Nikolai Ivanovich, that from the standpoint of the law and the instructions regulating the detention of citizens in so-called places of incarceration, this project cannot be interpreted unambiguously."</p><p>
"Why are you waffling here in front of me, Vasily, like a lawyer in court? You and I have known each other for fifteen years." Nikolai Ivanovich rose from his desk. For some reason, he was slightly agitated. He took a turn around his office and sat back down.</p><p>
"Tell me specifically how the law and instructions are violated here."</p><p>
"Specifically. . . . Well, to be specific I have to say this in order."</p><p>
"Say it in order, then."</p><p>
"We build a prison zone. The plans call for isolating the territory from the outside world. Two rows of barbed wire fence off the zone's hundred hectares, which is patrolled by guard towers. In general, the enclosure of the prison zone wholly corresponds to instructions. The plan goes on to propose dividing the zone up into individual lots of one hectare and allocating each plot to one prisoner. What's there to say here? According to the instructions, we are supposed to accustom irresponsible citizens to labor, to build workshops to make the simplest goods, and then to set up farms and shift partially to self-financing. According to the law, institutions like ours are allowed to have special terms for economic activity and the multipurpose use of the forest fund*. In our case, the plan calls for a farm that will provide our wards with vegetables with perhaps some left over for sale. So far we are within the framework of the law."</p><p>

"Don't drag this out. Keep going. Where do we go outside the framework?"</p><p>
"It proposes building a separate cell on each plot where the prisoner will live who has been allocated his hectare of land."</p><p>
"Yes, exactly, a separate cell for each person on his own hectare. There is not money for normal beds. They want a separate cell with all the conveniences and furnishings. A utopia."</p><p>
"You must not have read the plan carefully, Nikolai."</p><p>
"What does 'not carefully' mean? I remember it by heart."</p><p>
"I don't know, I don't know. . . . But a blueprint is attached here and a description of the interior of each separate cell, so to speak. Everything is strictly according to instructions. Bed, toilet, table, chair, bookshelf, stool. A metal door with a peephole and an external bolt, and bars on the windows. As for the financing, it says specifically that each prisoner will finance the manufacture of his single cell himself."</p><p>
"That wasn't in the plan when I read it."</p><p>
"I don't know. . . . I don't know. . . . Here, look, it's here. Both the drawing and the working blueprints for the manufacturers, and the description."</p><p>
"What does 'it's here' mean? When I gave you the folder for you to familiarize yourself, this was not there. I remember precisely that it wasn't. I've gone through this folder ten times cover to cover. That means you. . . . In two days . . ."</p><p>
"Yes, Kolya. I did. Only not in two days. They gave me the same folder three months ago. Recently I made my own corrections and additions, and they agree with them."</p><p>
"Why didn't you tell me anything about this?"</p><p>
"But you only asked me to give you my opinion two days ago."</p><p>
"Oh, all right, then tell me, what do you think of all this?"</p><p>
"Here's what I think, Nikolai. If this plan is carried out, then the number of prisons and labor camps in the country will be diminished and crime reduced. And you, Nikolai Ivanovich, will go down in world history as a brilliant reformer."</p><p>
"You can forget about history. Get to the point. The legality." Nikolai Ivanovich rose from his desk once again and started pacing around his office.</p><p>
The lawyer followed the pacing prison head, deep in thought, and asked, "Why is it, Nikolai, that you're so agitated?"</p><p>
"I'm agitated? Why should I be agitated? Actually, you're right, Vasily. I am agitated. I just don't know how I'm supposed to report to the general about this project in a brief report."</p><p>
"That's really something. So you have decided to promote it nonetheless—since you're going to see the general?"</p><p>
"I am. I thought you would criticize the project and talk me out of going to the general. The weight of the world is off my shoulders. You, too, apparently, support it, right?"</p><p>
"I do."</p><p>
"That means I'll have to go," Nikolai Ivanovich summed up rather joyfully, as if he’d been afraid that his friend was going to criticize the green folder's contents. The director went over to the cupboard and got a bottle of brandy, a lemon, and two glasses.</p><p>
"Let's drink to success, Vasily. When did you start feeling so sympathetic toward this green folder?"</p><p>
"Not right away."</p><p>
"Nor I."</p><p>
"My daughter is studying law at the institute. She's writing her thesis now. Her thesis topic is 'The Effect of Holding Citizens in Places of Incarceration on Eradicating Criminal Acts.' She gave me her paper to read. In it, she writes, 'Ninety percent of the citizens serving prison sentences go on to repeat crimes upon release. The main reasons for the painful statistics on crime are the following:</p><p>
"'— the person's upbringing, which led to the commission of a crime;</p><p>
"'— the difficulty of adapting to society after a person has spent time in a place of incarceration;</p><p>
"'— the formation of a criminal worldview during the time the person is in a criminal environment!'</p><p>
"Can you imagine what she's written, Nikolai? She's saying that you and I, while honestly performing our service, are shaping a criminal class."</p><p>
"We aren't shaping anything. We're acting according to regulations, laws, and instructions, although you know that I, too, hold a certain dissatisfaction. I've tried to drive it out of me. I thought this wasn't any of my business. But when this green folder showed up, I thought about it for six months. Now I've decided I'll go see the general. Unfortunately, I've sat down several times to put together a more intelligible report, but it's not working."</p><p>
"Let's try together. I think the main thing is not to frighten the higher-ups with the plan's originality or singularity. It should be as simple as possible."</p><p>
"I agree, it should. But how, if they're asking for each prisoner who has served his sentence to keep his allocated hectare of land after release for lifetime use?"</p><p>
"Yes. That point cannot be met for now. There is no law in Russia right now about allocating land for lifetime use. I was thinking about that point. We have to tell them honestly. At the end of their term, the question of allocating the plot of land to the freed prisoners will be considered within the framework of the land legislation current at the time of their release. I think they'll understand. It's clear to everyone you can't jump higher than the law. We aren't writing laws. But we also have to talk about the trend. Everything right now is leading to there being a law allowing people land ownership."</p><p>
"God willing." Nikolai Ivanovich refilled their glasses with brandy. "Let's have another short drink to success."</p><p>
They clinked glasses, and suddenly Nikolai Ivanovich put his glass on the table and once again started pacing around his office.</p><p>
"What's got you going now?" his lawyer asked.</p><p>
"You see, Vasily," Nikolai Ivanovich spoke with alarm, in a rush, "here you and I have been dreaming like little boys about lofty matters. We've been dreaming and forgotten that we're dealing with criminals. Of course, among them there are those who simply went astray. Perhaps they do want to start their life within the law, but the bulk of them are brutes. They're thinking about something completely different, and what cunning do we see in them here?"</p><p>
"I've thought about that, too, Nikolai, but let's you and I check them out. Then you can decide whether you should take the report to the general."</p><p>
"How will we check them out?"</p><p>
"Here’s how. Tell me, when did they give you this folder?"</p><p>
"About six months ago."</p><p>
"That means they discussed this plan more than six months ago and did the drawings and blueprints. Then they put everything handsomely into the folder and attached ninety declarations. Let's assemble those who wrote declarations in the auditorium suddenly, without warning. We'll invite specialists—agronomists and farmers—and let them test them. They'll ask questions about how, what, and when to plant in the soil, and we will see how many want to answer. You see, if they are serious about all this and if there's no catch to this idea of theirs, if this is their dream, then they couldn't simply sit and wait six months for an answer to their proposal. They will have had to have studied agricultural production."</p><p>
"You're the limit, Vasily. To think that brutes would study how to plant flowers and cucumbers for six months—it's hard to believe. Someone from the countryside might answer, but those men . . ."</p><p>
"That's what I'm saying. Let's check them out before you decide whether to go to the general."</p><p>
There were two hundreds prisoners sitting in the auditorium, not ninety. By the time the colony director had invited specialists in agricultural production—two teachers from the agricultural institute and one from the vocational school—the number of men wishing to settle in the new zone had risen to two hundred.</p><p>
The prisoners sat, not suspecting that they were now going to be given an exam. They saw three men sitting at the table on stage, but they had no idea who they were. The prison director came on stage and announced, "In connection with the fact that we are proposing setting up farming, we need people who know something about agriculture. Basically, I present to you teachers from the relevant educational institutions. They will ask you questions, after which we will decide whom to give a plot of land."</p><p>
Nikolai Ivanovich introduced the teachers in turn and suggested they ask questions of those gathered. First to ask a question was the elderly teacher from the agricultural school sitting on the right.</p><p>
"Which of you, sirs, can tell me when tomato seeds need to be planted in order to cultivate seedlings? When should the seedling be planted in the ground? And if you know the expression 'transplant,' then tell me, please, what signs speak to its necessity?"</p><p>
"Well, he certainly let them have it," thought Nikolai Ivanovich. "Multiple questions. Even my wife, a confirmed summer person, probably could not answer a question like that from memory. She's always checking her books before planting anything. And here the audience is sitting in silence, not a peep out of them."</p><p>
The silence in the auditorium upset Nikolai Ivanovich, for in his mind he wanted the prisoners' plan carried out. He had become so captious toward the plan not because he rejected it, but because he wanted to eliminate all its flaws and defects beforehand. The silence of the auditorium spoke to the careless attitude toward the project among its main participants, and that meant the impossibility of carrying out what was set forth in the green folder.</p><p>
"Great, they're silent. Is there really not a single man from the country? Although, even in the countryside, it's the women, not the men, who work in the gardens."</p><p>
In order to relieve the extended pause, Nikolai Ivanovich rose from his table and said sternly, "Didn't you understand the question?"</p><p>
"We did," a young prisoner sitting in the first row answered.</p><p>
"If you understood it, then answer the question."</p><p>
"Who should answer? You didn't call anyone to the board."</p><p>
"What do you mean 'who'? What board? Whoever knows the answer should raise his hand."</p><p>
In an instant, all two hundred prisoners sitting in the auditorium raised their hands high.</p><p>
At that, the examining teachers, who had been talking amongst themselves, froze. Mixed emotions flooded Nikolai Ivanovich. Here was pride in his wards, a return of hope for the plan's implementation, and alarm. Would any of those who had raised his hand be able to answer the question correctly enough?</p><p>
"Why don't you answer?" he gestured toward the young prisoner who had spoken.</p><p>
The young man stood up. He smoothed his bald head with his tattoo-pricked hand, and without hesitation began to speak quickly.</p><p>
"The time to plant tomato seeds for cultivating seedlings cannot be the same every year. It depends on the onset of stable weather, without frosts, and this weather is different from year to year. Considering the necessity of planting seedlings in the soil before the plant blooms, and knowing their vegetative period, we can calculate the time for planting seeds for cultivating seedlings in greenhouses or on a windowsill."</p><p>
"That's enough, young man," the vocational school teacher interrupted the prisoner's speech. "Raise your hands. Who can continue?"</p><p>
Once again, those sitting in the auditorium raised two hundred hands. The teacher pointed to an elderly prisoner who looked like a hardened criminal, with a gold crown in his mouth. The prisoner rose and began gravely.</p><p>
"The soil for them has to be good, not just any old crummy spot. You have to take humus worked by worms, or peat. Only you can't plant seeds in peat soil like that. They get used to the peat fast, and then later they go crazy when they're planted in the garden because it's going to be different for them. That's why you should mix the peat with a little sand and dilute it at least by half with soil from the garden. And you have to warm their earthy nest to, oh, twenty-five degrees before you poke the seed into the ground."</p><p>
"That's enough," the presenting teacher interrupted him. "In principle, you spoke accurately. But let's let the next man continue"—and he pointed to an intelligent-looking prisoner wearing glasses from the third row. "So, your previous colleague stopped at the point where, before planting a tomato seed in the soil prepared for it you must . . . What must you do?"</p><p>
The prisoner who had risen from his seat adjusted his glasses and continued.</p><p>
"Before planting the seeds in the soil prepared for them, they have to be taken into the mouth and held in your saliva under the tongue for at least nine minutes."</p><p>
The examiners sitting at the table and the colony director froze in surprise, staring at the prisoner in glasses. After a brief pause the teacher from the institute asked, "Do you mean to say that before planting seeds in soil you need to soak them in water?"</p><p>
"Never in water, especially chlorinated or boiled water, where all the vital bacteria have been killed. You must soak them in your own saliva in order to fill them with information about yourself. In a person's mouth, in his saliva, at body temperature, the seed after nine minutes will awake from its slumber and immediately understand what it is to do and for whom it will bear fruit. If the person has any health problems or abnormalities, the seed will try to bear fruit that eliminates the abnormalities."</p><p>
The teachers sitting at the table spoke animatedly among themselves. Then all three turned to Nikolai Ivanovich, and the vocational school teacher asked, "Who held classes with your wards, what institution did you invite specialists from?"</p><p>
Even several days later, the colony director could not understand why he had blurted out this answer to that question:</p><p>
"I don't know which one, I didn't do that, but I know it was from the capital. A distinguished professor came."</p><p>
The prisoners sitting in the auditorium appreciated the colony director's fib. They realized he was defending them. He wasn't letting them laugh at those who spoke and supported him silently with gratitude. But the young prisoner from the first row added, "We thought he was an academician, not a professor. He also knows a lot about the Siberian taiga, about life."</p><p>
"Yes," the prisoner's neighbor added. "A very smart guy, a real scholar."</p><p>
Approving exclamations were heard from the different ends of the auditorium regarding the professor from the capital whom no one had ever laid eyes on.</p><p>
The institute teacher sitting at the table on stage, who had been silent this whole time, suddenly spoke with a clever look.</p><p>
"Yes, colleagues, I have had a peek at this theory, though I don't remember what the source was. Science is now working in this direction. I think there is something intriguing in this. Body temperature . . . vital human saliva saturated with a diversity of living bacteria . . . there is something to this."</p><p>
"Yes, yes. I'm remembering," the vocational school teacher said thoughtfully and also with a clever look, pretending that he, too, had heard something. "This is one of the new trends in vegetable production. Theoretically, of course, there is science at its base, but it needs to be viewed in practice."</p><p>
The prisoners sitting in the auditorium replied without hesitation to many questions on agricultural production. Their answers weren't always standard. But the outside examiners were no longer in any hurry to protest them; on the contrary, they listened with interest.</p><p>
When the colony's deputy director escorted the teachers out, Nikolai Ivanovich sat alone quietly at the table in front of the still auditorium. In the silence of the room, he leafed through the green folder. Then he looked around and said, "Here's what I'm going to say to you, men. Your idea isn't entirely clear to me. . . Yes. Not entirely. . . . And so I've decided . . . Basically, I don't know what will come of this, but I'm going to try to promote it with my superiors."</p><p>
As if on command, the quiet room suddenly stood up and broke out in applause. Not expecting that reaction, Nikolai Ivanovich stood up as well. He was embarrassed for some reason, although he felt good and joyful deep down. However, trying to hold on to his image as a stern and even strict director, he said, "What is this noise? Take your seats." He himself felt the inappropriateness of his excessive severity in this situation and added, "but we really do need to invite a professor from the capital."</p><p>
</p><p>General Pososhkov, head of the Penitentiary Administration, received Nikolai Ivanovich and immediately got down to specifics.</p><p>
"Not only you but others, too, are going to have to expand their institutions. Some by five to ten units, some by a hundred and fifty. And you must prepare to receive an additional contingent in a year. Everyone is reporting that it is hard, unrealistic, and the prisoners are overfilled as it is. But what would you have me order you do? I have a decree from the minister to provide for the reception of an additional six thousand prisoners. But you have cheered me up, Nikolai Ivanovich. So, you say you will be prepared to receive them right on time."</p><p>
"Yes, I will. Only the plan has to be changed. I set it out in my report."</p><p>
"Yes, I read it. Only I don't understand everything in your report. You want to engage in agriculture. Praiseworthy. Allocate a separate plot to each prisoner. But who's stopping you? Why do you need my permission? But the fact that you want to build separate cells on each plot looks rather odd and irrational. Build a common barrack or two. In the morning they go to work under guard. Lower costs. You're not going to get additional financing for separate cells."</p><p>
"But I'm not asking for additional financing."</p><p>
"What are you asking for?"</p><p>
"Approval for a single cell on each plot and the overall plan."</p><p>
"But where will you get the money to construct these single cells?"</p><p>
"Sponsors will help."</p><p>
"You have strange sponsors. Well, all right. I don't have the time to go into this. I'm writing ‘Look into and complete' on your draft . . . but I'm going to call them myself and tell them to look into it and complete it properly . . . without any delays. Is that all you have?"</p><p>
"There is one other problem."</p><p>
"What's that?"</p><p>
"I don't have land where we can farm."</p><p>
"Then go to the governor and ask him."</p><p>
"I saw his deputy. They're considering it, but for now just considering it."</p><p>
"All right, I'll help. I'll put in a call. Is that all you have?"</p><p>
"Yes, sir."</p><p>
"Then get to work. Good luck."</p><p>
</p><p>Nikolai Ivanovich's prison received the land, two hundred acres, before fall. Before the roads got bad, they managed to surround the arable land, which was far from settlements, with barbed wire on five-meter posts, for a perimeter. Nikolai Ivanovich realized that if they didn't set this up in the fall, it would be impossible to start the spring work on the plots. But how could they do that if even the dirt road stopped two kilometers shy of the allocated parcel? They couldn't get the equipment to drill holes for the posts, or get the workforce to the allocated parcel.</p><p>
The prisoners learned of the problem. And they went to the colony director with a proposal. They would dig the post holes by hand, and they would travel the two kilometers on foot under guard.</p><p>
Even in the cold fall rains, putting on ponchos they'd made themselves from tape and plastic, every day fifty prisoners headed in a column toward the allocated land. More wanted to, but due to the shortage of guards, only fifty could go at a time. The plots' future owners worked with total devotion. By the time the frosts set in, all the posts had been set, the guard towers built, and the barbed wire stretched. They had also prepared the lumber for the checkpoint and put it up.</p><p>
In the fall, an order was put in for the manufacture of small huts—single cells for the prisoners to live in. Each cost 30,000 rubles. There was no money left to buy them. The prisoners themselves sought out funds however they could. Some, of course, had savings on the outside, some were helped by relatives, but there were also those who had no way to get that kind of money. They went to the colony director, reporting on their readiness to live in tents, but this contradicted instructions and they were refused.</p><p>
One hundred and eighty huts were brought to the new zone over the frozen road and set up on piers the prisoners had built in the fall. In the early spring, one hundred eighty prisoners settled in these primitive huts with bars on the windows.</p><p>
One sunny spring day, standing on a guard tower, the colony director saw something unusual. One hundred eighty parcels had been laid out on two hundred hectares surrounded by barbed wire. They were separated by tent pegs and branches. Here and there, the plots' boundaries were marked by stretched wire.</p><p>
"Those are the wealthy ones," the colony director decided. "Their relatives got them money not just for a cell but also to fence it off."</p><p>
Paths ran between the plots and in the middle of the zone lay an area for assemblies. Here and there, in low-lying places, the snow had not yet melted, but on the knolls, the first grass was already green. Men’s solitary figures were black on nearly every plot.</p><p>
In their warm prison vests, rough caps with earflaps, and crude kersey boots, they seemed identical and faceless.</p><p>
What could these figures do on empty land? Why shouldn't they sit quietly in their cells? The colony director brought his binoculars to his eyes and started watching one of them. Prisoner Khodakov, cutting his shovel into the not entirely thawed earth, was digging a hole. Nikolai Ivanovich moved his binoculars and counted nineteen holes already dug in the frozen soil of the plot's perimeter.</p><p>
On the other plots, the figures in dark vests were doing the same thing, digging holes along the perimeter of their plots.</p><p>
"Why are they digging so many holes?" Nikolai Ivanovich said out loud.</p><p>
"That's for the saplings and bushes that will create a green fence for each plot," the sentry explained.</p><p>
"I see. But they might have waited a week or two, the land would have been thoroughly thawed and then digging would be easier."</p><p>
"That's what I told them, but they don't want to wait. They're afraid they might not make it in time. For each to plant four hundred meters of green fence is no joking matter. And when the earth thaws, they'll have to work on their gardens.</p><p>
The colony director watched for a lot longer at how eagerly and even fervently his wards were working.</p><p>
"There is obviously a cosmic connection between the soul of a human being and the soul of the earth," he thought. "If there's that connection, man is in harmony with the planet. If there's isn't, he isn't. Perversions begin and crime increases.</p><p>
"Of course, that book, Anastasia, is something unusual. The prisoners read it and something inexplicable blazed up in their souls. I also read it and started to look at life differently. Of course, the book played its part, and they're now reading it in all the prison zones. But after all, the book's power consists in the fact that it points to the connection between the human being and the earth. That means the main thing is this connection, and it must not be broken. All these discussions of lofty morality and spirituality are nothing but empty talk without this mysterious, still not entirely clear connection."</p><p>
</p><p>In the fall, all the plots of the new zone, as the prisoners themselves called it, were framed with small saplings of apple trees, pear trees, mountain ashes, birches, and other plantings, whose leaves' pied fall coloring created a picture pleasing to the eye. Tree saplings covered approximately 1500-2000 square meters of each hectare. By the first fall, the view of the two hundred hectares from the zone's tower had changed drastically for the better, compared to the spring picture of vacant, black earth. It could be clearly seen that behind the rows of barbed wire an unusual green oasis arose.</p><p>
All summer, fresh greens were supplied to the prison cafeteria from the zone, then cucumbers, tomatoes, and beets.</p><p>
In the fall, each prisoner turned in from the plot of land entrusted to him five sacks of potatoes and several dozen jars of salted cucumbers and tomatoes. The prison kitchen received enough beets, carrots, and radishes for the whole winter.</p><p>
One could observe something unusual at the new zone's checkpoint. Unlike all the world's prison checkpoints where parcels for prisoners are received, in the new zone the handover came from the zone.</p><p>
Soldiers handed out jars of preserved vegetables to the prisoners' relatives. Many came in cars and went away with a rich harvest.</p><p>
Those prisoners who did not have relatives nearby, gave their harvest to resellers, through the soldiers, and earned a decent income.</p><p>
But no one came to see prisoner Khodakov; he had no relatives. He was a children's home boy, and he asked that his part of the harvest be taken to the nearest children's home.</p><p>
Nikolai Ivanovich received the administration's gratitude for successfully carrying out the decree. He was the only one who had been able to accept an additional one hundred eighty prisoners without a deterioration in the conditions for maintaining the rest.</p><p>
The year past had been the busiest for Nikolai Ivanovich in all his twenty years of service. Apart from his usual tasks, he had to get a hold of seeds and fruit tree saplings for the new zone, but each time he rejoiced when the prison's old ZIL arrived loaded to the top with small saplings.</p><p>
</p><p>Another five years passed. One sunny July day, a helicopter hovered over the new zone and began circling. Nikolai Ivanovich stood by the checkpoint and watched the helicopter flying over the new zone. He knew that on board the helicopter were General Pososhkov and members of a Justice Ministry commission. Either someone had written a complaint against the colony director, or rumors about the criminals' unusual detention had begun to circulate.</p><p>
The high-ranking commission disembarked from the helicopter, which had landed on the helipad near the checkpoint. But Nikolai Ivanovich thought only about the zone's enclosure.</p><p>
"Yes, I'm going to be hit with an obvious violation here. Why did I ever allow them to plant these climbing perennials to fence off the zone? They've climbed three meters high on all the barbed wire and formed a green fence, so that the barbed wire can't be seen.</p><p>
"You see, the barbed wire had created an ugly view for them, and the sentries had planted their guard towers with climbing flowers. Flowers now climb all the way to the sentry's booth. The zone looks less like a prison and more like a heavenly oasis in the surrounding neglected fields."</p><p>
"Here you have the first blatant violation," the general from the ministry said. "What kind of zone enclosure is this? Anyone who wanted to could climb over an enclosure like this, covered with liana," the general said, turning to the administration chief, Pososhkov. "Any soldier can tell you that. Am I right?" the ministry representative addressed the lieutenant on duty standing at the checkpoint by the entrance.</p><p>
"May I answer, comrade general?" The lieutenant on duty was standing at ease.</p><p>
"Answer, when asked. Is there a violation of regulations here?"</p><p>
"Not at all, comrade general. In this case, you are seeing a tactically improved enclosure for a prison zone."</p><p>
"What's that?” the ministry commission member said in amazement. "What kind of tactical improvement is that? What are you going on about?"</p><p>
All the commission members stopped by the lieutenant standing at ease by his post.</p><p>
"Here's a joker," Nikolai Ivanovich, thoroughly vexed, said. "This Lieutenant Prokhorov is always going on with his little jokes. If only he hadn't cracked jokes in front of the commission. Now they are definitely not going to forgive me his mockery. And he's standing at ease and isn't even blushing at his impertinence."</p><p>
The lieutenant began, emphasizing each word.</p><p>
"Allow me to answer the question about improvement."</p><p>
"Answer, if you can," the general from the ministry ordered. "You mean your flowers are a tactical improvement?"</p><p>
"Yes sir, comrade general. A criminal who wants to escape and has decided to climb over this barbed wire fence that's entwined with flowers might climb over but won't be able to get far."</p><p>
"Why is that?" the general wondered.</p><p>
"While they're getting over the fence entwined with fragrant flowers, they are entirely saturated with their fragrances, so that even an inexperienced dog can easily pick up his trail and bring him back."</p><p>
"So, he gets saturated." The general began to laugh, and all the commission members started laughing with him. "So the dog, follows the flower's fragrance. . . . Well, good for you, lieutenant, very resourceful. And how many escapees have your dogs brought back this way?" the general asked through his laughter.</p><p>
"Not a one," the lieutenant replied and went on very gravely. "Understanding the full hopelessness of climbing the fence, in five years the criminals have not made a single attempt to escape."</p><p>
The lieutenant amused the commission members even more with his serious look and statement.</p><p>
"You mean there has not been a single escape attempt in five years?" the commission chairman asked the administration chief.</p><p>
"That's right, not a single one," Pososhkov replied.</p><p>
The commission members obviously liked the lieutenant's witty answers, and they asked him the next question.</p><p>
"Tell us, lieutenant, if criminals don't even try to escape from this zone, then why do you have the watch towers and armed soldiers?"</p><p>
"To protect the zone from the outside world," the lieutenant answered.</p><p>
"What does that mean? From the outside world? Does anyone try to get into this zone?"</p><p>
"Yes, sir," the lieutenant reported. "Many prisoners' wives have expressed the desire to live with their husbands in their cells. Some have asked to spend the summer in the cell with their children. But strict observance of our colony director’s instructions for holding prisoners does not allow that kind of outrage. Some of the more unenlightened wives try to climb through the green fence with their children or tunnel in. But the zone's guard does not permit these kinds of audacious attempts."</p><p>
Not sure whether the lieutenant was speaking in jest or seriously about prisoners' wives and children trying to break into the zone, the commission chairman asked Nikolai Ivanovich, "Have such instances in fact taken place?"</p><p>
"Yes," Nikolai Ivanovich replied. "Two attempts have been intercepted. I've received ninety-six statements from prisoners' wives requesting that they and their children be allowed to spend the summer on their husbands' plots. But we cannot allow anything beyond the visits sanctioned in the instructions."</p><p>
"But what attracts them so to the zone, and with their children, too?" the commission chairman asked, and he added, "Actually, gentlemen, let's go in and take a look around."</p><p>
"Open the gates," Nikolai Ivanovich ordered the lieutenant.</p><p>
The wooden gates, decorated with carving, were quickly opened, the commission members entered the zone, and after taking just a few steps, suddenly, without consulting each other, stopped.</p><p>
From the helicopter window, the zone looked like a pretty green oasis. But here it was not only the handsome paths of cut grass, not only the green, multicolored, living enclosures that struck the commission members. The delightful, subtle fragrance of summer flowers and plants enveloped these people, who were used to the smells of their offices and the streets of the capital. The silence was broken only by birds singing and insects buzzing. These sounds soothed rather than annoyed them.</p><p>
"We should go into one of the plots," the commission chairman said, softly for some reason, as if he were afraid of disturbing someone.</p><p>
The high-ranking officials walked down the path of the first plot to the cell-hut. The small wooden hut was fitted with metal bars. But you could only tell that when you came up very close. From far away it looked like a green knoll. Entwined with various plants and surrounded by flowering bushes, it fit harmoniously into its surroundings.</p><p>
By the entrance to the hut, his back to the men approaching, a man stood in a white tee-shirt. The prisoner was greasing the metal bolt and energetically jerking it back and forth. The bolt was barely responding, and the man, distracted by his work, did not notice the approaching delegation at first.</p><p>
"Hello, Kharlamych," Nikolai Ivanovich called to him. "Receive your visitors. Introduce yourself."</p><p>
The man quickly turned and was somewhat at a loss when he saw the men approaching, but he quickly recovered and introduced himself.</p><p>
"Prisoner Kharlamych, sentenced under Article 102 of the Russian Criminal Code to twelve years. I served six years of my punishment in a cell. I've been in the new zone for five years."</p><p>
"What were you doing just now with your door?" the commission chairman asked the prisoner.</p><p>
"I was greasing the outside bolt, citizen chief. It was getting very hard to move. They've started making poor quality metal, so it rusts quickly."</p><p>
The commission chairman walked up to the door leading to the cell, shut it, and tried to pull the bolt back. He did it, but not on the first try. Then he turned and, giving administration chief General Pososhkov a significant look, said, "So, you're saying that all the instructions for holding prisoners are being observed. So, after the end of work all are locked in their cells?"</p><p>
The administration chief was silent. It was clear to everyone that the metal bolt had rusted and was hard to close because it simply had not been used in a long time.</p><p>
Prisoner Kharlamych realized he had undermined his director. Thoughts went racing through his head.</p><p>
"I should have adjusted that damned bolt long ago. But how can I explain to these people that this bolt isn't needed at all? No one would think to leave the zone and abandon his plot. For the sake of what? Where would I go? This is my home, my Homeland. Here, every morning, birds' voices greet me and the branches of the trees I planted wave to me every morning. I've got a kid, Nikita, and ten laying hens, and two hives. The others also have their own, not quite the same, but their own, which has become their home, their farm, their territory. And here I have let the director down with this damned bolt."</p><p>
Kharlamych was seriously upset, and he began talking quickly, agitatedly.</p><p>
"I'm a terrible bastard about this bolt, citizen director. There's no forgiveness for me if it brings misfortune down on my comrades. Only you must understand, let me have one last word. Look . . . I'll tell you. My whole life has changed—not even changed. Life here has only just begun. My liberty is here. There, outside the gates, is my imprisonment; there is my darkest hell. The soldiers standing over there on the towers, they are like angels for us. We pray the angels won't let all kinds of filth penetrate here.”</p><p>
Prisoner Kharlamych's voice cracked from agitation, and the meaning of what he said had a unique effect on the people standing in front of him. A woman—a State Duma deputy who belonged to the high governmental commission—also rather agitated, blurted out, "Why are you harping on that poor bolt? Can't you see it rained last night? It’s dried out."</p><p>
The commission chairman glanced at the metal bolt and the woman and started to laugh.</p><p>
"Dried out? How could I have missed that before. There was indeed rain, it did dry out, and it rusted. . . . So you're saying there are angels on the towers?" the commission chairman asked prisoner Kharlamych.</p><p>
"Yes," Kharlamych replied.</p><p>
"Well, and when does your sentence end?"</p><p>
"In eleven months and seven days."</p><p>
"How do you plan to live afterward?"</p><p>
"I've written a request asking them to extend my sentence."</p><p>
"What do you mean extend it? Why?"</p><p>
"Because there is no liberty there; in that liberty there is no order. There is no liberty without land."</p><p>
"But who is preventing you from getting out and acquiring land and creating the same kind of place, only in freedom? Raising a family?"</p><p>
"Oh, citizen director, that is something I just can't understand. Who in Russia is keeping us from giving each Russian a hectare of land? I just don't understand. Does the Russian land belong to the Russians or not?"</p><p>
"Right now, according to a law passed by the State Duma, each person can buy land," the woman deputy told him.</p><p>
"But what if I don't have the money to buy an entire hectare of land? Does that mean I have no Homeland? Is that how it works—I don't and won't? And if Russia is my Homeland, who should I be buying it from? It seems that someone seized my entire Homeland, all of it, every last hectare, and is now demanding a ransom from each Russian. It's like negotiating with bandits. This is not right by law or by our ideas. Take you, citizen director," Kharlamych addressed the commission chairman, "you're a general, I can see from your stripes. Free our Homeland from whoever seized it and is now demanding ransom. Or are you going to pay the ransom for your piece of the Homeland, too?"</p><p>
"Prisoner Kharlamych, stop this discussion," Nikolai Ivanovich intervened.</p><p>
He saw the scar on the cheek of the former battle general turn red and his fists clench. The general walked up to the prisoner, and they stood and looked each other in the eye. Stood there and said nothing. Then the general said softly, "Show me your farm, Russian," and he added, very quietly, as if to himself, "your piece of the Homeland behind barbed wire."</p><p>
Kharlamych showed the commission members his young orchard with fruit on the branches and treated them to currants and raspberries. Kharlamych had beds of tomatoes and more than two hundred square meters sown with cucumbers. He showed them his pond, which he had dug with a shovel. Next to the pond were neatly stacked kegs.</p><p>
"This is Kharlamych's main piece of know-how," Nikolai Ivanovich explained to the commission members as he pointed to the kegs. "Every year he salts one hundred fifty-liter kegs of cucumbers. He makes an excellent brine, unsurpassed. And he's come up with a most original storage method. He fills a keg with cucumbers and brine, caulks it, and puts it in the pond, underwater. They keep like that until spring. Whenever buyers from the Moscow restaurants come, Kharlamych breaks the ice and hauls a keg to the checkpoint, and we sell them at fifty rubles per keg. Two hundred fifty goes to Kharlamych, and the rest for prison needs."</p><p>
"How much income does each farm yield for your institution?" one of the commission members asked.</p><p>
"On average, about a hundred thousand a year," Nikolai Ivanovich replied, "but half goes to those working on the plots, as stipulated in the contract."</p><p>
"A hundred thousand?" a commission member said in amazement. "And altogether you have a hundred eighty hectares, which means that every year you take in ninety million from them net?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"That means the prisoners get fifty thousand a year apiece?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"In our country we have more than a million citizens being held in places of detention. If only we could move all of them to this kind of wage. The country would have quite an income and, by all accounts, there would be significantly fewer criminals."</p><p>
"Move . . . them all?" another commission member joined in the discussion. "Here we have a different question. How to keep them from shutting the zone down. Why were we sent here? To sort things out. We have definite abnormalities here. Prisoners are living in better conditions than free people. And these prisoners, no matter how you put it, are criminals. So what are you going to do, Nikolai Ivanovich, when these men's sentences run out?"</p><p>
The colony director replied without hesitation.</p><p>
"If it were up to me, after their release I would let each one keep his farm. I'd remove the wire and move it to a new place and set up a new zone."</p><p>
In their report to the ministry, the commission members reported that they uncovered no violations of the instructions for detaining prisoners.</p><p>
"What about the reports about the criminals living in better conditions than many free citizens?" the minister asked.</p><p>
"The life of free citizens must be improved," the commission chairman remarked. "People should be given land. In deed, not words."</p><p>
"But that is not within our competence," the minister objected. "Let's get to the point."</p><p>
"Here's the point. We must introduce this experiment to all the institutions entrusted to us," the commission chairman stated firmly.</p><p>
"I agree with this as well," the female State Duma deputy said, supporting the chairman, and she added, "I also have firmly decided to submit to the State Duma for consideration draft legislation allocating to each Russian family that so desires a hectare of land for lifetime use for setting up on it their own homestead."</p><p>
</p><p>The Duma passed the law. In a united impulse, millions of Russian families began planting gardens and groves on their native land. And Russia blossomed. . . .</p><p>
In what year did this happen? What? It hasn't yet? Why? Who is stopping it? Who is not letting Russia bloom?</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0727>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>27. A Law for Deputies Elected by the People</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </p><p></br></div></p><p>
</p><p>
I realized that Anastasia's grandfather possessed not only unprecedented psychoanalytical abilities but also specific information about the social structure of different states. Yet how could he know about specific state institutions? After all, he lived in the taiga without a radio, telephone, or television. So where could he get information, say, about our state's power structures? Nowhere. Consequently, he could not possess specific information. Still, I asked, "Do you know that in our state, in Russia, there is an institution known as the State Duma?"</p><p>
"I do," came his answer.</p><p>
"And do you also know who works there and how?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"Do you know about every deputy?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"And do you also know what kinds of laws they are passing?"</p><p>
"Not only what laws they are passing, but also what laws they will pass. I know in advance. Why are you so surprised again, Vladimir? This is the simplest problem for a priest; it isn't even interesting."</p><p>
"I'm surprised because I don't understand how you can know about every deputy or about what laws the State Duma will pass in the future. This is some kind of incomprehensible mysticism."</p><p>
"There is no mysticism here whatsoever, and the problem is quite primitive."</p><p>
"Can you explain this phenomenon? This level of information?"</p><p>
"Of course, I can. All this is extremely simple. Look.</p><p>
"Five thousand years ago, the pharaohs had a Council. The Roman Empire had a Senate. The tsars had a boyar duma. What else is there to say? The names have changed, but the essence is always the same. After all, a law is not going to depend on a name but on what influences the deputy, what daily conditions imprison him, and what prospects lie before him. But all these conditions were programmed in him long ago. Knowing this program, it's simple to know in advance what and how they are going to be capable of deciding."</p><p>
"What does the law and the deputy's daily life have to do with this? How can it be connected to a highly global program? Not only that, what can you yourself know about the daily life of a modern deputy?"</p><p>
"It's very simple. Of course, I'm not going to talk about how one deputy, or another, or a third is going to sleep, what he'll eat, or what he'll wear. I neither need that nor find it interesting. But I will tell you about what is important.</p><p>
"As before, so too today, people come to be deputies who have overcome quite a few intrigues. That's for one. When they strive for power, many become dependent on those who have power over material things, but in going through all their trials, the deputies find themselves in their patrons' clutches. The program attempts to cut them off from their significant information, and it succeeds.</p><p>
"What does the deputy get? I'm sure that as before, so too now, he gets an office of his own, new housing, and now, probably, a car. Also two or three assistants, and some even more."</p><p>
"Yes, that's it more or less. And you're saying all this corresponds to a program that was developed thousands of years ago?"</p><p>
"Of course, it does. But wait, let me go on. Verify that I am not mistaken about the modern day—that the deputy has to work every day the way many people work. He goes to a hall for meetings and issues laws."</p><p>
"Yes, that's right."</p><p>
"And the term for each of them is defined as four years or five."</p><p>
"Now it's four."</p><p>
"Four, then. When his term ends, he has to stand for election again. But even before the new election, each is thinking about his campaign."</p><p>
"Yes, he is."</p><p>
"Wait, how do you know this? After all, you were amazed when I told you I knew what laws were going to be issued. But you yourself now are saying that you know what deputies are thinking about their future. Have you become a clairvoyant or something? Or an expert soothsayer?"</p><p>
"I haven't become anything. Here any fool understands. If re-elections are coming up, then everyone who wants to be re-elected will be thinking about them and making appropriate plans."</p><p>
"Just don't rush. Notice that you said, 'Will be thinking about re-election.'"</p><p>
"Yes, I said that."</p><p>
"But after all, the deputy should be thinking about new laws."</p><p>
"Well, yes. He is simultaneously thinking about laws."</p><p>
"When? During what time of day? In general, believe me, the program does not leave them time for thinking. The people have been electing deputies for more than a century, as you well know, and then expecting wise laws from them. The people do not understand that the program does not let people think.</p><p>
"Give this some thought yourself sometime."</p><p>
</p><p>More than once after this I did ponder this situation. Indeed, the generally accepted laws on the election and duties of deputies began to seem like gobbledygook.</p><p>
Let us try to analyze the practice as it has come about. A relatively intelligent person, even a little more intelligent than others, decides to run for Duma deputy, to take part in passing wise laws that help people have a good life.</p><p>
While he grinds through the difficulties of the electoral campaign, he becomes dependent on capital, some to a greater extent—some to a lesser. Not that each candidate is given financial assistance by the wealthy of this world in exchange for future services. It is enough to see the levers money can activate. The press and TV news tell us about so-called dirty tricks, but we observe the situation through the eyes of outside observers. The candidate in an election campaign is not an outside observer. He feels the attacks of dirty PR. Anyone who hasn't experienced that might quite naturally propose the kind of weapon that could be used against him with the help of money. It is quite natural, like a defensive reaction: the rear has to be secured no matter what. But the rear is big capital. That means you have to wash ashore to some financial haven—or, as we now say, to the oligarchs.</p><p>
You could also become dependent on some party. It doesn't matter which one. What does matter is that your debt has to be worked off later.</p><p>
What about the wise laws? Just this. The appropriate conditions have simply not been created for passing them.</p><p>
Of course, deputies enjoy many perks, even immunity from law enforcement agencies. But the question remains. If we place on one side of the scale the benefits given deputies and on the other the stress connected with their work, the intrigues, and the intensity of their work, then it’s hard to say which outweighs the other.</p><p>
There is one more paradox. The history of humanity has never known a single individual, a single super-sage, capable hourly, day after day, of making exclusively wise decisions. Even outstanding rulers and commanders have made mistakes, as we know.</p><p>
The routine of deputies' work is set up in such a way that they have to meet daily, several hours a day. At each session they pass several bills, and those bills deal with various spheres of society's life.</p><p>
As history has shown, passing wise laws given this work routine is impossible, both theoretically and practically, because legislators lack the time to think. Nonetheless, it is this absurd work routine for legislators that exists in most countries on the different continents on Earth. Who set that up? Many think it set itself up somehow. But it didn’t. It is much too well thought out and purposeful. Furthermore, we are not discussing this at all seriously.</p><p>
You can try as much as you want to prove its perniciousness. You can demonstrate this perniciousness scientifically, with the help of psychoanalysts. This is important, of course, but it is not the main thing. The main thing is to understand what the alternative is. Yet no alternative comes to mind. Why should it, if this law has arisen in nearly all countries?</p><p>
However, if Anastasia's grandfather was the first to bring this question up, if he knew the work of those legislatures over the millennia similar to contemporary ones, he might be able to suggest an alternative.</p><p>
I asked, "Could you suggest your own scenario for elections and the subsequent organization of legislators' work?"</p><p>
He responded with the following.</p><p>
"It makes no sense to talk about the elections themselves until the deputies' working conditions and daily life change."</p><p>
"What do you think their working conditions and daily life should be like?"</p><p>
"First of all, deputies must be removed at least partially from the artificial information field and provided with nourishment that supports full-fledged brain function. An image must be created that enjoys the respect of society and can bring along every deputy."</p><p>
"What does ‘an image created' mean?"</p><p>
"Judging from what you have told me about deputies, their outward demeanor speaks to the fact that the people have a negative image of officials in general and deputies in particular."</p><p>
"Yes, in general, their image among the people is negative."</p><p>
"This is very bad. People construct negative thought-shapes for, consequently they are basically creating them to be negative. And an image is the most powerful and concentrated energy for many people’s thoughts."</p><p>
"But if their lives don't improve, why should people think of deputies positively?"</p><p>
"There, you see, you get a vicious circle. Each time it seems as if you're choosing the best people, but as soon as they're elected, you immediately decide they're the worst."</p><p>
"How specifically can we break this vicious circle?"</p><p>
"In the last five thousand years, there has been no better way than what Anastasia has proposed, and none is envisioned in the foreseeable future."</p><p>
"What do you have in mind?"</p><p>
"Land."</p><p>
"But Anastasia said each family who wants it should be given at least one hectare for lifetime use and for setting up their own homestead, but she didn't say anything about deputies."</p><p>
"Yes, that's right. For each family who wants it. But don't deputies have families?"</p><p>
"Yes."</p><p>
"So maybe we should begin with them."</p><p>
"The people will say they've gone way too far. Their benefits weren't enough for them."</p><p>
"It must be explained to the people for whom this is being done. It must be explained to the people how the laws that the people have been waiting for can appear."</p><p>
"But how should they be given land, on a universal or a preferential basis?"</p><p>
"Universal, but not entirely. Each deputy should receive at least one hundred fifty hectares of land where the new type of settlement should be formed, based on the principles Anastasia spoke about. Of the hundred fifty hectares, the deputy can have one hectare as his own property for lifetime use if his family is small and not likely to grow. If the deputy has children with their own families, and they also want their own homesteads, then a hectare apiece must be allocated for the children's families as well. In this way, the deputy can acquire one hectare, three, or five, depending on the size of his family."</p><p>
"What happens to the other hectares? You spoke of a hundred fifty."</p><p>
"He can use thirty percent of the rest to distribute to whomever he wants. On the remainder, people must be settled from different strata of society—soldiers, scientists, artists, entrepreneurs. Each settlement must have one or two hectares presented to children from a children's home and refugees, but no one settlement should present land to two deputies."</p><p>
"And then? If each deputy has his own homestead, the laws will improve immediately?"</p><p>
"Of course, they will. The country will see the wisest laws in the world."</p><p>
"At what expense?"</p><p>
"Right now deputies spend a huge amount of time in their offices and in meetings, separated from the people. Right now they don't receive gratitude for good laws or reproofs for bad ones. Right now, following their natural desire, they strive to ensure their own family's material well-being. When their deputy terms come to an end, they can change their place of residence and move to another city or even country, where no one will reprimand them or prosecute them in the event of violations of any generally accepted norms. A change of residence or country does not affect their well-being. Everywhere, if you have money, you can get shelter, food, and clothing, but you cannot necessarily acquire a homestead, a Homeland. Today, the concept of Homeland has been distorted. They call a territory someone has marked off by borders a Homeland, but after all, a Homeland always begins with one’s native land and expands to the of the people equal to you in spirit. Those people are going to start setting up their own homesteads and acquire a Homeland and eternity. Loss of a homestead is the loss of a Homeland and eternity. This is the very greatest tragedy for a family. Laws and morality cannot keep deputies from making wrong decisions, but a homestead can. For people who have a Homeland, money will cease to be of primary importance. Only on his homestead can a person obtain the essential nourishment, including that for brain function, and after all, this is very important for people who need to think a lot. Sessions of the State Duma should be held a maximum of three days a week. Deputies should spend the rest of their time at their homestead. There they will think. There the fundamental process in creating laws will take place. Deputies' wives should not have jobs that are not connected with the activities of their deputy husband. The homestead will fence the deputy off, at least for a while, from the effect of the artificial world's information, from artificial information. This will help the thinking process. Great thoughts arose in the minds of great philosophers in conditions of solitude, not at the moment of their public appearances."</p><p>
"What if some of the deputies don't want to take the land and set up their own homestead on it?"</p><p>
"Now we have come to the elections of the people's elected representatives. If any of the deputies do not want to create a homestead, the people should not elect them for the next term. Though he may have citizenship in the country where he was elected, in fact he is a foreigner. He doesn't need this Homeland, and no matter what nice words are spoken about him, in fact he will not bring anything good to the people as a legislator."</p><p>
"But knowing that voters will show their preference to candidates who have their own homesteads, some deputies will take the land, build themselves palaces on it, tennis courts, and brick walls, but they won't plant a grove or an orchard, a living grove, as Anastasia said, so what then?"</p><p>
"Then they will show their essence. In this case, people will be able to make the right choice. Do you know why each person in ancient Russia had a patronymic? Even earlier in ancient Russia, in naming himself, a person would say, 'I am Ivan from Nikita's homestead,' naming his father or grandfather, the founder of their homestead. This means the homestead was famous for something. Naming it, the person spoke as fully as possible about himself and his character and abilities. A man who could not point to his own homestead with pride was considered without kith or kin."</p><p>
The more Anastasia's grandfather spoke about homesteads, the more powerfully in my consciousness the joyous picture of our country’s future came to life. Just imagine. Imagine! Three hundred sixty State Duma deputies each take one hundred fifty hectares of land and organize three hundred sixty beautiful settlements of the new type. Each of them shows what he is capable of not only in word but in deed.</p><p>
The first three hundred sixty oases will appear in Russia, and there Russians will begin to live in human conditions. Then these deputies will issue laws, and naturally, not a single law will pass that harms the ecology.</p><p>
They will write laws that truly guarantee each citizen the right to receive his own small piece of the Homeland. They will defend that right because they, too, will have their own Homeland.</p><p>

</p><p>
My esteemed readers!</p><p>
Many thanks to you for your understanding and moral support. My thanks to everyone who has openly expressed his attitude in Internet messages and publications in the literary miscellany or who has attempted to organize a discussion of the ideas set forth in the "Ringing Cedars of Russia" book series, through the press.</p><p>
My thanks to you, Russian scholars. Above all, to Boris Minin, who openly came out on the Podmoskovye Palace of Culture stage and gave a worthy assessment of Anastasia's ideas.</p><p>
Separate thanks go to the marvelous actor, Distinguished Artist of Russia Alexander Mikhailov, who took part in the conference.</p><p>
My thanks to Viktor Medikov, doctor of economics, who has written and published more than one work investigating the ideas reflected in these books.</p><p>
My thanks to Anatoly Eryomenko, current member of the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences, for his beautiful poetry.</p><p>
</p><p>To the Divine Being</p><p>
</p><p>Despite my years and health, my indolence,</p><p>
To you my knee I bend in reverence,</p><p>
If just to see the triumph gleaming,</p><p>
The life in you—the Divine Being.</p><p>
</p><p>Chimeras racing from the darkest realm</p><p>
Instantly you overwhelmed,</p><p>
And helped me to forget my sorrow</p><p>
By inscribing the tablet of tomorrow.</p><p>
</p><p>A man is what I saw in you, sublime,</p><p>
From the close, perhaps, of another time,</p><p>
Where, midst Goddesses, my children’s children</p><p>
Will flourish, live, as your embodiment.</p><p>
</p><p>Only deep in my heart do I protest,</p><p>
Protest quietly your "I exist!"</p><p>
No sin is it to think, to talk</p><p>
Of you in front of one and all.</p><p>
</p><p>So from my heart a Ray I send,</p><p>
My living dream to you intend,</p><p>
And in reply—asleep, awake—</p><p>
In the taiga I will see your shade.</p><p>
</p><p>To Russia's Elders</p><p>
</p><p>Oh, Russia’s elders, worldly wise,</p><p>
For the orphan child have you no word?</p><p>
Oh, more beautiful than blue your eyes,</p><p>
Shining tirelessly on the world.</p><p>
</p><p>Rousing tirelessly those once weak,</p><p>
Our foolish tribe, in a human wave,</p><p>
Should no words come to them to speak,</p><p>
The cedar they will split and save.</p><p>
</p><p>Like heavenly manna, they will give it secretly,</p><p>
To all those moving off to eternity</p><p>
And with this manna of mystery</p><p>
Lead us all into infinity.</p><p>
</p><p>So we may bend our knee,</p><p>
And our backs this instant—now—unbow,</p><p>
And rid ourselves of care and worry,</p><p>
And idleness today, not tomorrow.</p><p>
</p><p>So we may hear a voice, from ages past,</p><p>
A voice above us, breaking, whispering,</p><p>
"You are nature’s children, at last,</p><p>
And death, the funeral, are not your ending.”</p><p>
</p><p>A home’s destruction is not the ending,</p><p>
Nor is the impasse or the muddy mire,</p><p>
All who accept the living Teaching,</p><p>
Nature’s contact will inspire.</p><p>
</p><p>Like a heavenly wave, the forces all—</p><p>
The Gods of heaven and the earth—</p><p>
The forces given us by the hand incorporeal,</p><p>
Will see that love awakens in our heart.</p><p>
</p><p>That we, proud, united as brothers,</p><p>
Pull the bowstrings of our soul,</p><p>
And open our arms to all others,</p><p>
Shooting forth our ray of gold.</p><p>
</p><p>Then, above the earth of spring</p><p>
The cherry trees will burst in white,</p><p>
No more troubles will there be,</p><p>
And new generations will delight. . .</p><p>
</p><p>Oh Russia’s elders, whom we revere,</p><p>
Hasten to speak the word so true,</p><p>
Let Anastasia’s living cheer</p><p>
Shine forth for us like the heavens’ blue.</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you to Viktor Pavlovich Garkavets, head of the Kharkov Department of Education, and to the teachers, workers, and administration of that Ukrainian city's Tractor Plant, where a beautiful meeting with readers was organized.</p><p>
Thank you to all the organizers of readers' conferences in other towns.</p><p>
Thank you to the Russian émigrés in Germany and Canada.</p><p>
Thank you to the bards who have now written more than five hundred songs, and to the artists who have sent their pictures. They have already been placed on the website, www.Anastasia.ru, and the best of them will be published in a literary miscellany, The Ringing Cedars of Russia. One of these works has been put on the cover of this book.</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you to the tens of thousands of people who have expressed their opinion of my books in their sincere and inspired letters.</p><p>
Thank you to everyone for your open support; without it I would have a much harder time writing!</p><p>
</p><p>However, I do want to share with you, especially with those public figures who are still just planning to speak out in support of Anastasia's ideas, the following thoughts.</p><p>
You have to understand that there is resistance to these ideas. It is planned and organized. It is still not entirely clear who specifically is spreading the false rumors, or which levers they are using.</p><p>
You have to know this in order to determine for yourself whether it is worth it for you to openly support the ideas set forth in my books.</p><p>
I know from my own experience how unpleasant slander and provocations are, but it is many times harder for me when they are directed at you, my readers—and even harder when they are specific and focused, as, for example, against the children and teachers at Academician Shchetinin's school.</p><p>
I wouldn't want others to be subjected to similar attacks.</p><p>
</p><p>I am not just convinced, now I also know for an absolute certainty that the force of the ideas set forth by Anastasia is such that they cannot be discredited to extinction. Their materialization could, of course, be temporarily postponed, but they are going to be revived in people all the same with ever greater force.</p><p>
In my opinion, today the most essential and important issues today are the following.</p><p>
First. The organization of local schools, courses, and seminars. It is essential to adapt general plans for homesteads and settlements to the specific locality.</p><p>
The healing properties of the herbs and plants growing in your immediate area must be studied. You need to know precisely which vegetables and fruits can grow in the natural conditions of your climate.</p><p>
Concrete working plans for your homesteads and settlements must be drawn up down to the smallest detail.</p><p>
Second. Scholars who understand the essence of what is happening must be brought into the work of creating a program for the development of the Russian state. This must be a comprehensive program which, through the setting up homesteads, should solve the problems of child orphans, refugees, and poor families and which, through the prosperous existence of each family, will create the well-being of the state as a whole.</p><p>
Your dream must be specified in detail, and then it will have to come to pass.</p><p>
Let each person do everything along these lines that he can, starting from his own abilities.</p><p>
Tens and hundreds of plans for homesteads and settlements must be born. Plans for the economic, ecological, and spiritual development of individual regions and the entire state.</p><p>
</p><p>You know, when I saw Anastasia for the first time, she was standing on the banks of the Siberian River Ob. She was wearing an old, long skirt and a vest and was wrapped up in a scarf and wearing rubber galoshes on bare feet. The taiga hermit looked quiet and lonely then.</p><p>
Now you get the impression that this was our Russia standing in the remotest Siberia wearing rubber galoshes over bare feet. This was our dream of the future, standing solitarily on the deserted bank of a Siberian river. But now it is a part of us!</p><p>
The time will definitely come when our dream, free and open, wearing a ball gown, will come true all over Russia, and not only Russia.</p><p class=tbc>
The greatest energy in this dream is the ENERGY OF LIFE!</p><p class=tbc>
To be continued...</p></div>

<p>
Anastasia was still sleeping. But above the boundless Siberian taiga the pre-dawn sky was growing bright. This time I was the first to awaken, but I continued to lie quietly beside her on my sleeping bag, admiring her beautiful, tranquil face and the smooth features of her figure. They grew more and more defined in the soft heavenly light of the dawning morning. It was good she’d set up camp for the night under the open sky this time. She’d probably known the night ahead would be warm and quiet and for that reason had made up her bed near the entrance to her cozy dug-out home, instead of inside it. For me she laid out the sleeping bag I’d brought with me on my last visit to the taiga, and next to it, she made up a beautiful bed for herself out of dried grass and flowers.</p><p>
She looked great on that taiga bed, dressed in a thin linen dress that reached to her knees – I’d brought it to her as a gift from our readers. Maybe she wore it only in my presence, because she could just as well have slept naked. The colder it is in the forest, the more dry grass you can pile up – after all, you won’t get cold in a haystack in the winter. Even a simple person, one who isn’t as conditioned as Anastasia, can sleep in hay without any warm clothing. I’ve tried it. But this time I lay on my sleeping bag. I lay, gazing at the sleeping Anastasia and imagined how this scene might look in the movies.</p><p>
… A taiga glade deep in the Siberian taiga. The pre-dawn stillness is disturbed only now and then by the barely audible rustle of the branches in the tops of the majestic cedars. And a beautiful woman sleeps serenely on a bed of grasses and flowers. Her breathing is very regular and barely audible. You only see the way a thin blade of grass clinging to her upper lip bows a bit as she breathes in the healing air of the Siberian taiga and then breathes it out again…</p><p>
Never before had I managed to catch sight of Anastasia sleeping in the taiga – she was always the first to awaken. But now…</p><p>
I was enjoying looking at her. Carefully sitting up a bit and propping myself up on one arm, studying her face, I got to thinking and began inwardly talking to myself:</p><p>
“Anastasia, you’re still so beautiful. Soon it will be ten years since we met. I’ve aged since then, of course, but you’ve barely changed. Your face is untouched by wrinkles. And only one little strand of gray has appeared in your golden hair. Something unusual has gone on with you, that’s clear. Judging by the massive campaign directed against you and your ideas, and by statements in the press and in the bureaucratic structures, something is going on in the dark forces’ camp. They’re trying to annoy me, and they would be so thrilled to get to you. But it’s clear they can’t reach you…</p><p>
“Even so, now a gray strand has appeared on your head. But it doesn’t spoil your unusual beauty. You know, it’s stylish now to dye separate strands of your hair various colors. Our young folks think highlighted strands of hair are stylish and pretty. But you don’t need to go to the hairdresser: yours appeared all on its own. And the little scar from the bullet fired at you has almost healed over.</p><p>
“The pre-dawn sky had grown brighter still, but you almost couldn’t see the small scar on her temple, even from close up. Soon it would be entirely gone.</p><p>
“Here you are, sleeping serenely, out in the fresh air, in your taiga world, while there, in our world, very important events are taking place. Researchers call them the ‘information revolution.’ Perhaps, thanks to you, the people of our technocratic world are starting to create their family homesteads and enrich the land at their souls’ behest. They’ve wholeheartedly embraced your image, Anastasia, the beautiful image of the future of their family, of their country and maybe even of the whole world order. They’ve understood you, and they themselves are building this beautiful future.</p><p>
“And I am trying to understand, too. I’m trying, to the extent that I’m able. I still haven’t completely understood your significance for me. You’ve taught me to write books, given birth to our son, made me famous and given me back my daughter’s respect – you’ve done a great deal. But that’s not the most important thing. That lies elsewhere. Maybe it’s hidden somewhere inside me.</p><p>
“You know, Anastasia, I’ve never spoken of how I feel about you. I’ve never spoken to you about it, or to myself. And basically, never in my whole life have I ever said, ‘I love you’ to a single woman.</p><p>
“It isn’t that I’m totally without feelings, that isn’t why I haven’t said it. Rather, it’s because I consider those words strange and meaningless. Because if one person loves another person, he should expressed this love in the way he acts toward his beloved. If you have to say the words, that means there are no genuine, tangible actions. And really, actions are more important, not words.”</p><p>
… Anastasia stirred slightly and sighed deeply, but didn’t wake up. And I continued conversing with her, silently:</p><p>
“I’ve never spoken to you of love, Anastasia. But if you were to ask me to pluck a star from the heavens, then I would climb to the top of the tallest tree and, pushing off from the last branch, I’d jump toward that star. If I were to end up flying downward, then as I fell, I’d grab hold of the branches – and I’d climb up to the crown once again and once again jump toward the star.</p><p>
“You haven’t asked me to pluck any stars from the heavens, Anastasia. You’ve only asked me to write books. I’m writing them. It doesn’t always turn out well. Sometimes I fall down. But you know, I still haven’t finished them. I still haven’t written my last book. I’ll try to make it pleasing to you.”</p><p>
… Anastasia’s eyelashes trembled, a light blush appeared on her cheeks, and she opened her eyes. The tender gaze of her gray-blue eyes… My God, these eyes always radiate such warmth, especially when they’re so close. Anastasia looked at me silently, and her eyes shone, as if full of moisture.</p><p>
“A good morning to you, Anastasia! This is probably the first time you’ve ever slept so long. You used to always wake up first,” I said.</p><p>
“And a good morning and a beautiful day to you, too, Vladimir,” Anastasia answered quietly, almost in a whisper. “And I feel like sleeping a tiny bit more.”</p><p>
“You mean you haven’t had enough sleep yet?”</p><p>
“I’ve had enough sleep, a very good sleep. But a dream… My pre-dawn dream was so nice…”</p><p>
“What dream? What was it about?”</p><p>
“I dreamt that you were talking to me. Of a tall tree and a star, of falling downward and then striving upward again. Words about a tree and a star, but it was as if those words were about love.”</p><p>
“Sometimes things in dreams don’t make sense. What possible connection could there be between a tree and love?”</p><p>
“There can be a connection anywhere, and the significance is great. Here feelings are what’s key, not the words. Along with the dawn, the day has presented me with an unusual feeling. I’ll go greet it and embrace it.”</p><p>
“Who, ‘it’?”</p><p>
“The beautiful day, the unusual gift that’s been presented to me.”</p><p>
Anastasia slowly got up, took a few steps away from her dug-out’s entrance and… She always did this in the morning – her own original form of exercise. And so now, too, she spread her arms out to the sides and slightly upward. For a second or two she looked to the sky and then suddenly started spinning around. Then she took a running start and did her unbelievable somersault. Then she began spinning around once more. While I lay on my sleeping bag by the dug-out’s entrance, admiring Anastasia’s headlong movements and thought, “That’s really something! I mean, she’s no longer a child, but look how quickly and beautifully and energetically she moves, like a young gymnast. And I wonder – how did she sense what I was saying to myself while she was sleeping? Maybe I should have declared my love after all?”</p><p>
And I shouted: “Anastasia, it wasn’t just a dream you had.”</p><p>
She immediately stopped in the middle of the glade. Then, swiftly somersaulting once and then again, until she was right next to me, she quickly seated herself on the grass and began speaking joyfully:</p><p>
“Not just a dream? And in what way ‘not just’? Tell me right away. Tell me every detail.”</p><p>
“Well, you see, I was kind of thinking about that tree, too. I was talking to myself about a star.”</p><p>
“But where, tell me, where did you come up with those words? And what gives birth to them, to words like that?”</p><p>
“Maybe feelings give birth to them?”</p><p>
Our conversation was cut short by a shout from Anastasia’s grandfather:</p><p>
“Anastasia! Anastasia, you have to hear me right now, you have to understand!”</p><p>
Anastasia jumped up and I also quickly got up.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0802>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>2. Victory Over Radiation</p></h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>
“Has Volodya done something unusual again?” Anastasia asked Grandfather, who’d run up to us. And Grandfather, after giving me only a cursory glance and tossing me a quick, “Hello, Vladimir,” explained:</p><p>
“He’s on the bank of the lake. He dove in and got a pebble from the bottom. Now he’s standing there with it clutched in his hand. I imagine that the stone is burning his little hand, but he’s not letting go of it. And I don’t know what advice to give him. Then Grandfather turned to me and said severely:</p><p>
“Your son is over there. You’re his father… what are you just standing here for?”</p><p>
Not totally understanding what was going on, I ran to the lake. Grandfather ran alongside me and explained:</p><p>
“This pebble is radioactive. It’s small, but there’s a great deal of energy in it. This energy is similar to radiation.”</p><p>
“How did it get there, on the bottom of the lake?”</p><p>
“It’s been there for a long time. My father knew about this pebble way back when. But no one was able to dive down that far.”</p><p>
“How did Volodya dive down that far? How did he know about it?”</p><p>
“I trained him to dive deep.”</p><p>
“What for?”</p><p>
“You see, he kept after me, always asking me to. You all don’t have the time to raise the child, so you’re always passing that off to the old folks.”</p><p>
“But who told him about the stone?”</p><p>
“Well, who besides me would tell him? I told him.”</p><p>
“What for?”</p><p>
“He wanted to find out what keeps the lake from freezing over in the winter.”</p><p>
When we ran up to the lake, I saw my son standing on the shore. His hair and shirt were wet, but the water had already run off of them, so I figured that meant he’d already been standing there a long time.</p><p>
My son, Volodya, stood with his arm stretched out before him, his fingers closed in a fist, and he was looking at his fist with great concentration, not shifting his gaze. It was clear that clutched in his hand was the fateful stone from the bottom of the lake. I took two steps toward my son. He quickly turned his head toward me and said:</p><p>
“Don’t come near me, Papa.”</p><p>
And when I stopped, he added:</p><p>
“I welcome your thoughts, Papa. But step back a bit further. Maybe it’d be better for you and Grandfather to lie down on the ground. That way I’ll be able to concentrate.”</p><p>
Grandfather immediately lay down on the ground, and I, too, without knowing why myself, lay down next to him. For some time we silently watched Volodya standing on the shore, and then a very simple thought came to me, and I said:</p><p>
“Volodya, why don’t you just fling it far away from you?”</p><p>
“Where, far away?” asked my son, without turning around.</p><p>
“Into the grass.”</p><p>
“I can’t throw it into the grass – a lot of things might perish there. I have the feeling I shouldn’t throw it yet.”</p><p>
“So what are you going to do, keep standing there, for a day, for two? And then what? Will you keep standing there for a week, a month?”</p><p>
“I’m thinking about how to proceed, Papa. Let’s not talk. Let’s allow the thought to find a solution. We shouldn’t distract it.”</p><p>
Grandfather and I lay there silently, looking at Volodya. And suddenly I saw that Anastasia was slowly – very slowly, given the current situation – coming from the opposite side of the shore. When she’d come to within about five meters of Volodya, she sat down on the shore of the lake as if nothing at all was going on, dipped her feet into the water and sat that way for a time. Then she turned to our son and asked him, with complete calm:</p><p>
“Is it burning your hand, Son?”</p><p>
“Yes, Mama,” Volodya answered.</p><p>
“About what were you thinking when you were picking up the stone, and about what are you thinking now?”</p><p>
“Energy’s coming from the stone, energy similar to radiation. Grandfather’s told me about it. But energy also comes from humans. I know that. And human energy is always stronger – no other energy can conquer human energy. I got the stone, and I’m holding it. I’m trying with all my strength to suppress its energy. To send it back, inside. I want to demonstrate that man is stronger than any radiation.”</p><p>
“And are you succeeding in demonstrating the superiority of the energy coming from you?”</p><p>
“Yes, Mama, I’m succeeding. But it’s getting warmer and warmer. It’s burning my fingers and palm a tiny bit.”</p><p>
“Why won’t you throw it?”</p><p>
“I feel that I shouldn’t do that.”</p><p>
“Why not?”</p><p>
“I feel that.”</p><p>
“Why?”</p><p>
“It… It will explode, Mama. It will explode as soon as I open my fingers up. It will be a powerful explosion.”</p><p>
“That’s correct – it will explode. The energy trapped in the stone is coming out. You’ve suppressed its stream with your own energy and sent it inside. You mentally formed an image of the core inside the pebble, and now both your energy and its energy are accumulating there. It can’t accumulate endlessly. It’s already inside the core that you created in your thoughts. It’s seething and heating up, and the stone is burning your hand.”</p><p>
“I understood that, and that’s why I’m not opening my fingers up.”</p><p>
On the outside, Anastasia was utterly serene, her movements were slow and fluid, and she spoke in a measured way, with pauses, but I felt that she was unusually focused, and that her thought was probably working faster than ever before. She stood up, stretched in a kind of indolent way, and calmly said:</p><p>
“So, Volodya, you understood that if you uncover the pebble all at once, there might be an explosion?”</p><p>
“Yes, Mama.”</p><p>
“Well, then that means you have to release it gradually.”</p><p>
“How?”</p><p>
“Slowly. First, if you loosen your thumb and forefinger a little, you’ll uncover part of the stone, and right then, mentally imagine that the energy you put into the stone moves upward out of it, in a beam. And that the stone’s energy begins to follow your energy. Be careful. The ray should go out only in an upward direction.”</p><p>
Volodya, focusing his gaze on his tightly clenched first, slowly relaxed his thumb and forefinger. It was a sunny morning, but even in the light of day the ray coming out of the stone was visible. A high-flying bird ended up in the ray and turned into a puff of smoke. As if it were a tiny cloud that had exploded in steam as the ray slid along it. And within a few minutes, the ray became barely noticeable.</p><p>
“Goodness, I’ve sat here too long with you all,” said Anastasia. “I’ll go on ahead, maybe get breakfast ready while you all amuse yourselves here.”</p><p>
She walked away, again very slowly. After she’d taken a couple of steps, she staggered a bit, then went up to the water and washed her face. She had probably been hiding her unbelievable tension behind a façade of calm. She’d hidden it so she wouldn’t frighten our son or hinder his actions.</p><p>
“Mama, how did you know what needed to be done?” Volodya shouted after the receding Anastasia.</p><p>
“How did she know?” asked Grandfather, teasing Volodya. Cheerful now, he’d already gotten up off the ground. “What do you mean, how did she know? Your mother was a star physics student in school.” And he began howling with laughter.</p><p>
Anastasia turned in our direction, also started to laugh, and answered:</p><p>
“I didn’t know about this before, Son. But no matter what happens, you always have to seek and find a solution. And not limit your thought with fear.”</p><p>
When the ray had become totally invisible, Volodya opened his fingers. A small, longish pebble lay peacefully on his palm. He looked at it for some time, muttering to himself, “That which is contained within you is not more powerful than man.” Then he once again clenched his fingers into a fist, took a running start and, still in his shirt, dove into the lake. He didn’t appear again for about three minutes, and when he did surface, he immediately swam to the shore.</p><p>
“I’m the one who taught him to conserve his air that way,” said Grandfather.</p><p>
When Volodya had come out onto the shore, he jumped up and down, shaking the water off himself, then he walked up to us, and I couldn’t restrain myself and spoke up:</p><p>
“Son, do you have any idea what radiation is? You don’t. Because if you did, you wouldn’t have gone in there and dived for that stone. Can you really not find anything else to do here?”</p><p>
“I know about radiation, Papa. Grandfather told me about the disasters you have at nuclear power plants, what kind of weapons there are, and about the problems that have arisen with storing nuclear waste,” answered Volodya.</p><p>
“So what’s this stone got to do with that, the stone lying on the bottom of the lake? What’s it got to do with it?”</p><p>
“Exactly, what has it got to do with it?” asked Grandfather, joining the conversation. “You educate him a little, okay, Vladimir? And I’ll grab a bit of rest. Because your son’s been placing an awful lot of demands on me lately.”</p><p>
Grandfather began moving off, and my son and I were left alone.</p><p>
My son stood before me in his wet shirt. He was clearly upset that he’d made everyone worry. I no longer felt like giving him a hard time. I just stood there, saying nothing, not knowing what to say. Volodya spoke first:</p><p>
“You see, Papa, Grandfather told me that those nuclear waste dumps harbor a very great danger within them. According to the theory of probability, they can cause irreparable harm to a great many countries and to the people living in them. And even to our whole planet.”</p><p>
“Yes, of course they can, but what do you have to do with all of it?”</p><p>
“Well, if people figured that the problem’s been solved, but the danger still remains, then that means the problem hasn’t been solved correctly.”</p><p>
“And so, what’s incorrect about it?”</p><p>
“Grandfather said I’m the one who has to find the correct solution.”</p><p>
“Well, have you found it?”</p><p>
“Now I have, Papa.”</p><p>
He stood before me, my nine-year old son, wet, with an injured hand, but sure of himself. And he spoke in a calm and confident tone about how to solve the problem of storing nuclear waste. It was exceedingly strange. After all, he wasn’t a scientist, not a nuclear physicist, and he’d never even attended regular school. Very strange. A wet child is standing on the shore of a lake in the taiga and discussing how to safely store nuclear waste. I didn’t have any hope whatsoever that he could offer any effective solution to this problem, but just to hold up my end of the conversation I asked him:</p><p>
“Well, so tell me in detail how you’ve figured out this insoluble problem.”</p><p>
“Taking into account a great number of possible options, I think that the most effective is dispersal.”</p><p>
“I don’t get it. Dispersal of what?”</p><p>
“The waste, Papa.”</p><p>
“How do you mean?”</p><p>
“I understood this, Papa: radiation isn’t dangerous at all in small doses. It’s present in small quantities everywhere: in us, in plants, in the water, in the clouds. But if you concentrate it in one place, it’s genuinely dangerous. In the nuclear waste storage sites Grandfather told me about, radioactive objects are artificially concentrated in one spot.”</p><p>
“Well, everybody knows that. Radioactive waste is transported to specially constructed storage sites that are carefully guarded against terrorists. Specially trained personnel ensure that the storage technology isn’t breached.”</p><p>
“All true, Papa. But the danger still exists. And a disaster is inevitable, and its cause is someone’s specific thought, the incorrect solution that’s been forced upon people.”</p><p>
“Scientific institutions, with people who have advanced scientific degrees are working on this problem, Son. You’re not a scientist, you don’t know science, and for that reason you can’t tackle such an important problem. It’s contemporary science that should occupy itself with solving it.”</p><p>
“But look at the result, Papa. I mean, it’s precisely as a result of contemporary science’s solutions that human kind is being subjected to great danger. I, of course, don’t go to school and don’t know the science you’re talking about, but…”</p><p>
He fell silent and hung his head.</p><p>
“What does your ‘but’ mean? Why did you stop talking, Volodya?”</p><p>
“Papa, I don’t want to go to the kind of school you’re talking about and study science, the one you have in mind.”</p><p>
“Why don’t you want to?”</p><p>
“Because, Papa, that science leads to disasters.”</p><p>
“But you know, there’s no other science.”</p><p>
“Yes there is. Mama Anastasia says, ‘We need to determine reality solely through ourselves.’ I’ve understood what that means, and I’m studying, or determining. I’m not quite sure yet, how to say it precisely.”</p><p>
“Wow, he’s got strong convictions,” I thought, and I said:</p><p>
“And in your opinion, what’s the probability of a disaster?”</p><p>
“One hundred percent.”</p><p>
“You’re sure of this?”</p><p>
“According to the theory of probability and given the fact that nothing is counteracting this pernicious thought, a disaster is inevitable. You can compare the construction of large nuclear storage sites with the construction of large bombs.”</p><p>
“So, that means that your thought is acting to counter the pernicious thought?”</p><p>
“Yes, I’ve released my thought into space. And it will be victorious.”</p><p>
“But tell me the details. How has your thought solved the question of how to safely store nuclear waste?”</p><p>
“We have to deconcentrate all the nuclear waste concentrated in large storage sites – that’s my thought.”</p><p>
“Deconcentrate it – do you mean divide it up into hundreds of thousands or even millions of tiny pieces?”</p><p>
“Yes, Papa.”</p><p>
“A simple solution. But the main question remains: where to store these tiny pieces?”</p><p>
“On the family homesteads, Papa.”</p><p>
Because of the unexpected and improbable nature of what I’d heard, for a short time I didn’t even know what to say. Then I practically shouted:</p><p>
“Insanity! What you’ve thought up is total insanity, Volodya!”</p><p>
Then I thought a bit and said, already more calmly:</p><p>
“Of course, if you deconcentrate the small nuclear pieces and spread them throughout a variety of places, then we can avoid a global catastrophe. But millions of families that have decided to live on the homesteads will be subjected to danger. I mean, all people want to live in an ecologically pristine area.”</p><p>
“Yes, Papa, all people want to live in ecologically pristine spots. But there are hardly any such spots left on Earth.”</p><p>
“And here in the taiga, is that not an ecologically pristine spot, either?”</p><p>
“This is a comparatively pristine spot. But not an ideal one, not primeval. There are no ideal spots left anywhere. Clouds can come from various places, and they bring acid rain here. For the time being, the grasses, trees and bushes are coping with that, but you know, the polluted spots are growing more polluted every day. And there are more and more such places every day. And that’s why we can’t retreat from what’s polluted – it’s essential to go on the offensive right now.</p><p>
“’We have to create pristine spots ourselves,’ – that’s how Mama puts it.</p><p>
“Out of the great number of possible options, my thought chose one. It doesn’t have any other option. It’s safer to deconcentrate and store a tiny piece on the homestead, to tame it and derive some benefit from it for life – that’s what my thought says.”</p><p>
“But where on the homestead? In the pantry? In a safe? Are you going to store this capsule with radioactive material in the root cellar? Has your thought shared that with you yet?”</p><p>
“The capsule must be stored in the ground at a depth of not less than nine meters.”</p><p>
I gave some thought to my son’s suggestion, which at first glance seemed so improbable, and I began to come around to the thought more and more: there really was a rational kernel in it. At the very least, the option he suggested for storing nuclear waster really would totally exclude the possibility of a massive disaster. As concerns pollution on any given homestead, then it really would be possible to avoid that and derive some benefit, too. Maybe scientists could come up with something like a small reactor. Or something else along those lines.</p><p>
Suddenly a thought came to me, too. Wow! That’s it! Here’s another reason it’s essential to deconcentrate nuclear waste storage. Money! Foreign governments pay massive amounts of money to store this waste. That money is used to build the storage facilities, too, and to support the ancillary staff and the whole security structure. Part of the money, as usually happens, disappears who knows where. Let them pay this money to each homestead where capsules with the radioactive waste are stored. Great! Safety will be guaranteed, and at the same time, people will be paid money, too.</p><p>
At the present time, no one can guarantee the safety even of those living far from storage facilities. When the accident happened at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, parts of territories not only in Ukraine, but in Russia and Belarus, too, were subjected to contamination. The clouds were able to disperse the pollution over hundreds and even thousands of kilometers.</p><p>
So, my son’s suggestion, even though it was theoretical for now and needed to be worked out in detail, was still worthy of the most detailed attention, not only from the scientific world and governments, but also – and most importantly – from the public.</p><p>
Strolling along the shore of the lake, lost in my own thoughts, I totally forgot about my son. But he remained standing silently in the same spot, watching me. His upbringing didn’t allow him to address me first. It was considered unacceptable to interrupt someone who was lost in reflection.</p><p>
I decided to shift the conversation to a different topic.</p><p>
“So, you’re always reflecting on various problems, Volodya, but do you have any responsibilities? Have you been charged with carrying out any kind of work?”</p><p>
“Work? … Charged?... I always do what I want. Work? What do you mean by the word ‘work’, Papa?”</p><p>
“Well, work is when you do some task and get paid money for doing it. Or you do some activity that brings benefit to the whole family. Take me, for example. When I was your age, my parents charged me with taking care of the rabbits. And I took care of them. I tore up grass for them, fed them, cleaned their cages. And the rabbits brought our family income.”</p><p>
Once Volodya had heard me out, he suddenly said, excitedly:</p><p>
“Papa, I’m going to tell you now about one responsibility I’ve charged myself with. It’s a very joyous responsibility. But you can figure out for yourself whether to call it work or not.”</p><p>
“All right, tell me.”</p><p>
“Come on, then. I’ll show you a certain spot.”</p><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
My son and I began heading away from the lake. Volodya was walking up ahead of me. He was different somehow: he’d changed from thoughtful and concentrated to joyfully exuberant. Every once in a while he’d turn around as he was walking, bounce up and down and quickly tell me:</p><p>
“I haven’t taken care of rabbits, Papa. I’ve been doing a different task. What could I call it? I’ve been birthing… no, that doesn’t fit. Creating? That doesn’t fit so well, either. Okay, I remember. You call it hatching eggs. So, I’ve been hatching eggs.”</p><p>
“What do you mean, hatching? A brood hen or some other kind of bird hatches eggs.”</p><p>
“Yes, I know. But I needed to hatch them myself.”</p><p>
“What for? Tell me everything in order.”</p><p>
“In order. All right, everything happened in this order.</p><p>
“I asked Grandfather to find me several wild duck and goose eggs. At first Grandfather grumbled a little, but after three days he brought me four big goose eggs and five ones that were a bit smaller – duck eggs.</p><p>
“What I did next: I dug a small hole in the ground, put some deer manure and grass on the bottom, covered all of this over with dry grass, and laid the eggs Grandfather had brought me on top.”</p><p>
“What did you need the manure for?”</p><p>
“It gives off warmth. The eggs need warmth if the chicks are to hatch. And they need warmth from above. Sometimes I’d lie down on top myself and cover the hole with my stomach. When the weather was cold or if it was raining, I charged a bear with lying atop the hole.”</p><p>
“But how did the bear manage not to crush the eggs?”</p><p>
“You see, the bear is big, but the hole with the eggs was small. You know, he was lying on top of the hole, and the eggs were on the bottom. And either I’d have a she-wolf guard the eggs, or I’d sleep next to them myself until they started pecking their way out. It’s such a joy to watch when they peck their way out. The only thing was, not all of them hatched. From nine eggs we got two goslings and three ducklings. I fed them grass seeds, grated nuts and gave them water myself. Whenever I fed them, I’d always invite the various animals that live in our territory.”</p><p>
“What for?”</p><p>
“So they’d see what care I was taking of them and understand that they weren’t allowed to lay a paw on them, that the opposite – they needed to guard them. I’d also sleep next to the hole where the ducklings and goslings were born, and when the nights were cold or when it would rain, I charged the bear with sleeping next to them. The chicks would hide in his warm fur and that was good for them.</p><p>
“Then, if I’m going to tell you everything in order… I stuck pegs around the hole and wove a fence out of branches, and I also covered over the top of the nest with branches. The goslings and ducklings grew a bit and learned how to crawl out of their hole. And I’d walk around their nest, and I’d whistle in a staccato: ‘Cheep-cheep-cheep.’ They’d climb out right away and run after me. They tried running after the bear, but I taught them not to do that. The bear might go far away and they might perish.</p><p>
“But nothing happened to them. They grew bigger, feathers appeared on them, and they learned to fly. I’d toss them upwards, so they’d learn. Then they began flying off somewhere or other, but they’d always return to their nest.</p><p>
“When autumn came and the various birds began coming together into flocks and getting ready to fly south, my now grown ducks joined a flock of ducks, and the geese – a flock of geese, and they all flew off to warmer climes. But I imagined, and was almost totally certain that they’d come back in the spring. And they did come back. Oh, how great that was, Papa! When they returned, I heard their joyful call: ‘Honk-honk-honk.’ I ran to the nest and I started calling, too: ‘Cheep-cheep-cheep.’ I fed them grass seed and some crushed nut kernels I’d gotten ready beforehand. They took the food right from my hand. I was overjoyed, and the local animals came running when they heard the calls and were also overjoyed. Look, Papa, we’re here! Look!”</p><p>
In a secluded spot between two currant bushes I saw the nest my son had woven. But there was no one nearby.</p><p>
</p><p>“You say they’ve come back, but there’s no one here.”</p><p>
“Not right now. They’ve flown off somewhere to have a stroll and feed. And so they’re not here, but Papa, look.”</p><p>
Volodya pulled aside the branches to widen the opening, and I saw three nest-holes. In one lay five eggs that were small in size, probably duck eggs. In another was one bigger egg – a goose egg.</p><p>
“Well, what do you know! This means they’ve come back and they’re laying eggs… Only not too many.”</p><p>
“Yes!” Volodya exclaimed delightedly. “They’ve come back and are laying eggs. They might lay more, too, if I take some of the eggs out of the nest and give the laying birds a little more food more often.”</p><p>
I looked at my son’s happy face, but couldn’t fully comprehend the reason for his joyous excitement. I asked him:</p><p>
“What are you so very happy about, Volodya? I know that none of you, neither Grandfather, nor Mama nor you uses eggs as food, and thus, we can’t call your actions a job or work, because there’s no practical benefit to be gained from them.”</p><p>
“No? But you know, other people eat birds’ eggs. Mama says that we can make use of everything that animals themselves give to man. Especially what they give to people who are used to eating not only plants.”</p><p>
“What do people and your actions have to do with it?”</p><p>
“I decided I should do this so that the people who live on the homesteads wouldn’t be burdened with concerns about managing their farms. Or would hardly be burdened at all. So that they’d have time to reflect. That’s possible. If we comprehend the conception of God, who created our world. I like the science of coming to know His thoughts. That is the greatest of sciences, and it’s essential to get to know it. For example, to come to understand: why did He make it happen that the birds fly south in the autumn, but don’t remain in the warm climes, and come back instead? I thought a lot about this, and this is what I posited: he did that so as to not make things difficult for man in the winter. In the winter, birds can’t find food for themselves, and they fly away. But they don’t stay in the south, they come back – they want to be useful to man. That’s how God conceived it. It’s essential for man to comprehend much of what’s been conceived by our Creator.”</p><p>
“Volodya, you mean you posit that on each homestead or in many of them, ducks and geese can live, lay eggs, and feed themselves, then fly south in the autumn and come back in the spring?”</p><p>
“Yes, you can make that happen. You see that I made that work.”</p><p>
“I agree, you made it work. But there’s one circumstance… I’ll probably discourage you, but all the same I have to tell you the truth. So you won’t look foolish with your proposal.”</p><p>
“Tell me the truth, Papa.”</p><p>
“There’s a science called economics. Economic scientists consider the most rational way to proceed in producing various products – in the given, concrete case, eggs. Many poultry farms have been built in our world. They keep a large number of hens in one spot. They lay eggs that then go to the stores. A person comes to a store and simply buys the number of eggs he needs. Everything’s done so that as little labor cost and time as possible go to producing each egg.”</p><p>
“What are labor costs, Papa?”</p><p>
“They’re the amount of resources and time spent to produce one egg. One has to carefully calculate the most effective, i.e., best, way to proceed.”</p><p>
“All right, I’ll try to calculate that, Papa.”</p><p>
“When you calculate all of that out, you’ll see for yourself. But for your estimate you’ll need data about expenses. I’ll try to get them from some economist.”</p><p>
“But I can calculate everything right now, Papa.”</p><p>
Volodya frowned slightly or concentrated, and after a minute he said:</p><p>
“Negative two to infinity.”</p><p>
“What kind of formula is that? What does it express?”</p><p>
“The effectiveness of Divine economics is expressed in an infinite series of numerals. The scientific economics of contemporary man is two units lower than the starting point, zero.”</p><p>
“That’s some strange method you have of calculating, incomprehensible. Can you explain to me how you calculated that?”</p><p>
“I posited a starting point, expressed in the given case by zero. All the expenses of the poultry farm connected to its construction, upkeep and the delivery of eggs to stores are expressed by the numeral negative one.”</p><p>
“Why negative one? These expenses should be expressed in rubles and kopecks.”</p><p>
“Monetary units are always varied and conventional, so in the given method they’re irrelevant. They need to be lumped all together under the conventional designation ‘negative one.’ Since expenditures exist, that means they can also be expressed in relation to the zero point – as negative one.”</p><p>
“And where did the second negative unit come from?”</p><p>
“That’s quality. It can’t be good. The unnatural conditions in which the hens are kept and the lack of varied feed will inevitably lower the quality of the eggs, and so one more number appears – negative one. Add them together and you get negative two.”</p><p>
“All right, I’ll grant you that. But look, there are huge expenditures of time in your case, too. Now, tell me, Volodya: how much time did you spend while you were, as you put it, hatching the eggs, then feeding your ducklings and geese and guarding them?”</p><p>
“Ninety days and nights.”</p><p>
“Ninety twenty-four hour periods, then. And all that effort so that after a year you’ll get a total of several dozen eggs. It would make far more sense for people living on homesteads to acquire ducklings at the market or raise them themselves in the winter with the help of electric incubators. Then after four to five months they’d start laying. The second year, farmers generally slaughter them before winter sets in, because by the third year their egg productivity falls. And so they kill them and raise new ones. That’s the technology.”</p><p>
“That’s the technology of ever-ongoing cares, Papa. You have to feed the chickens every day, lay in feed for the winter, and then a year later – raise still more new chickens.”</p><p>
“Well, yes, you have to feed and raise new ones, but if you use modern technology, this isn’t as labor-intensive as your version.”</p><p>
“But you see, ninety days is the time it takes to set the perpetual program in motion. When they return, the birds will already raise their descendants themselves, teach them to interact with people and keep coming back to their homeland. And they’ll do that for thousands of years. A person who sets this program in motion will be making a gift of it to his own future generations… He will be returning to them a tiny little part of the Divine economy. After a hundred years, the ninety days you spend to produce one egg will average out to just minutes per egg, and that figure will decrease with every year.”</p><p>
“But still, there are costs involved, and you didn’t figure them into your calculations.”</p><p>
“There’s a great counterweight to the costs, and it is no less significant than the product the birds produce.”</p><p>
“What counterweight?”</p><p>
“In the spring, when the birds once again fly back from the faraway lands to the forests and their home fields, people rejoice at the sight of them. Because of this beneficial, joyful energy, many illnesses disappear from people. But that energy will be ninety times stronger when the birds don’t simply return from the south – when they return specifically to you, and when they begin to greet the person living on the homestead with joyful calls or rapturous singing. Their singing brings joy and strength not only to the person, but to the whole area.”</p><p>
Volodya spoke with inspiration and confidence. To argue further with him would have looked idiotic. I pretended that I was thinking it over or calculating something in my head. I began to feel a tiny bit annoyed that there was nothing I could suggest to my son, or teach him.</p><p>
And what the heck kind of education or peculiar instruction did we have here? My son was right before me, but it was as if he was a child from some other planet or different civilization.</p><p>
He had a different view of life, a different philosophy and speed of thought. He did calculations instantaneously. And it was clear, I mean I got it – you could do calculations on a computer for a year, but his estimates would be a little more accurate. It was as if everything in him was inverted. Or, maybe it would be more accurate to say: to what extent have we distorted our own life? Its concepts and meaning. And all disasters result from these distortions.</p><p>
There’s no doubt that this is all true, and even so… I so want to be helpful to my son in some way. But how? Although I was no longer hoping for anything, I asked him calmly, in an offhand way:</p><p>
“Well, I’ll give your economics some thought. Perhaps you’re right… But tell me this, Son. You spend time here working on your various enterprises, and playing. But do you have any problems at all?”</p><p>
Volodya sighed deeply and somehow very sorrowfully, was silent for a bit, and answered:</p><p>
“Yes, Papa, I do have a big problem. And only you can help me solve it.”</p><p>
Volodya was sad, while I, on the contrary, was thrilled that he needed my help.</p><p>
“And what is it, this big problem of yours?”</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Big Problem</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>“Papa, do you remember me telling you the last time you came about how I’m preparing to leave and go out into your world, when I get a bit older?”</p><p>
“Yes, I remember. You told me you’ll come into our world, find your universe-girl, so that you can make her happy. You’ll build your homestead with her and raise your children. I recall you saying that. And what about it? You haven’t rejected your idea, have you?”</p><p>
“I haven’t rejected it. And I often think about the future, about my girl and about the homestead. I imagine every detail of how she and I will live together. And how you and Mama will come to visit us and see how the dreams that she and I created together are becoming a reality.”</p><p>
“So where’s the problem with that? Are you afraid you won’t be able to find your girl?”</p><p>
“No, that’s not it. I’ll look for the girl, and I’ll find her. Come on, I’ll show you another little glade. And you’ll understand for yourself, you’ll sense where the problem lies.”</p><p>
My son and I came to a small glade right next to Anastasia’s glade. When we stopped in the middle of the glade, Volodya suggested I take a seat, while he himself formed a megaphone with his hands and gave a long and drawn out call: “Hey-y-y-y!” First he called out in one direction, then in a second, and a third. Literally within two to three minutes a stirring began in the crowns of the trees surrounding the glade: squirrels were hopping swiftly from branch to branch. They were gathering in great numbers on one cedar tree. Several of them simply sat on one of the branches and looked toward us. Others, evidently more restless ones, continued jumping from branch to branch.</p><p>
After a few more minutes, three wolves ran out of the bushes, sat down at the edge of the glade and also began looking toward us.</p><p>
Soon a sable lay down about three meters from the wolves. Two goats appeared. They didn’t lie down, but rather stood at the edge of the glade, their gaze fixed on us. Before long a deer arrived in the glade. The last to appear was a huge bear, noisily making his way through the bushes. He also immediately sat down at the glade’s edge and continued to take frequent breaths, as saliva rolled off his tongue – he’d probably been kind of far from the glade and had had to run a long time.</p><p>
All the while Volodya stood behind my back, his hands on my shoulders. Then he took a couple of steps back from me, plucked several blades of some kind of grass and, coming back, said:</p><p>
“Open your mouth, Papa. I’ll give you a few blades of grass. So they’ll see me hand-feeding you and won’t worry at the sight of an unfamiliar person.”</p><p>
I took the blades of grass he’d brought into my mouth and began chewing them.</p><p>
Volodya took a seat near me, laid his head on my chest and said:</p><p>
“Stroke my hair, Papa, so they’ll settle down fully.”</p><p>
I happily stroked my son’s brown hair. Then he sat up next to me and began explaining things to me.</p><p>
“Papa, I realized that God created the entire world as a cradle for his son – man. Plants, air, water and clouds – everything was created for him. And beasts are also prepared to serve man with great joy. But we’ve forgotten, and now we need to comprehend what kind of service wild animals can render, where their calling and life’s purpose lie. At the present time people still understand quite a bit: a dog is to guard the dwelling or seek out a lost item, or keep order on the property. A cat is to catch mice if they begin stealing the stores of food. A horse is to haul things. But all the other animals were also given some kind of life’s purpose. And we have to comprehend it. I began to look and try to determine the life’s purpose of all these wild animals here. Right now they’re sitting and awaiting my command. This is the third year I’ve been working with them to determine their purpose in life. Take the bear, for example. He has large and powerful paws. He can dig out a hole for a root cellar, bury the stores in the pit, and then dig them up again. He can get honey out of a hollow tree.”</p><p>
“Yes, Volodya, I know. Anastasia has told me how people used bears as part of the work force on their property.”</p><p>
“Mama told me about that, too. But look what I’ve taught the bear to do.”</p><p>
Volodya stood up and stretched out his hand toward the bear. The bear grew totally concentrated, as if he had even stopped breathing, and when Volodya slapped his hand against his leg, the huge bear took a few swift bounding steps and lay down at my son’s feet. Volodya squatted down next to the beast’s huge head and patted him and scratched him behind the ear. The bear roared with pleasure. Volodya stood up and the bear immediately stood up next to him, intently watching my son.</p><p>
Volodya walked to the edge of the glade, found a dry branch and stuck it into the ground about ten meters from the spot where I was sitting. Then he went back to the edge of the glade once more, walked up to a small cedar about a meter high, touched it, and then clapped his hands together twice. The bear immediately ran up to the cedar and sniffed it. And then something unbelievable began to happen.</p><p>
I began watching this scene, along with my son, who’d taken a seat next to me on the grass.</p><p>
The bear spent a short time sniffing the little cedar. First he would step back from it, as if measuring something, and then he’d run up to the spot where the dry branch Volodya had placed was sticking up. And suddenly, right where the dry branch was sticking out of the earth, he began scraping the earth with his front paws.</p><p>
Within several minutes of working away with his powerful, sharped-clawed paws, he’d dug out a hole approximately eighty centimeters across and half a meter deep. He surveyed his work and even stuck his head into the hole, most likely sniffing it.</p><p>
Then the bear ran up to the cedar Volodya had indicated and began digging up the earth around it. When he’d formed something resembling a trench, the bear sat down on his hind legs next to the cedar, stuck his front paws into the trench and pulled out the cedar, along with a large clod of earth. Then he stood up and, walking on his hind legs while carrying this clod in his front paws, he headed toward the hole he’d dug earlier. He walked up to it, then carefully squatted down and lowered the clod into the hole. The hole turned out to be about fifteen centimeters larger than it needed to be. The bear ran off a short distance and studied his work. Then he pulled the cedar out once more, put it aside, added more earth to the hole, and planted the cedar in it once again. Now everything was as it should be.</p><p>
The bear took a step back, looking over his work once again. We could see he was pleased with it, because, coming back over to the cedar he’d planted, he began filling in the gap that had now formed between the clod of earth out of which the cedar was growing and the edges of the hole he’d dug. He’d rake up the earth, push it into the crevice and pat it down with his paw, tamping down the soil around the little tree he’d just planted.</p><p>
It was pretty interesting to watch what was going on, but I’d also previously had occasion to see the way squirrels would bring Anastasia dried mushrooms and nuts. Or how the wolves would play with Anastasia, and the way they’d defend her from wild dogs.</p><p>
And many people have also had occasion to watch all kinds of tricks involving various wild animals at circus shows. The dog named Cedra who lives with me is also very happy to execute a great number of commands.</p><p>
From the outside, the actions that were playing out in the taiga glade also resembled a circus show, only it was presented in a natural setting, instead of in an arena enclosed by a tall net. And the participants weren’t circus animals living in cramped cages, but free – or as we call them, wild – taiga dwellers. For us they’re wild, but for my son they’re simply friends and helpers. Something along the lines of our house pets.</p><p>
Even so, there still was one mysterious and improbable distinction between the two.</p><p>
People provide house pets with food, water and shelter, and this fact explains the pets’ devotion. And people who attend circus shows with wild animals can also see how the animal trainer rewards the lions or tigers each time they perform a trick successfully: he takes treats from a little bag on his belt or from his pocket and gives them to the animals.</p><p>
It’s impossible for circus animals that spend years of their lives in cages to acquire food on their own. They’re completely dependent on humans. But here, in the taiga, the animals are completely free and find food and shelter all on their own. But all the same, they come. And they don’t just come, but come running right away in response to the human’s call and carry out his commands. They have a great desire to carry them out, and they’re even submissive about it. Why is that? And what do they get in return? Volodya didn’t give the bear any food. However, the bear’s joy was much more pronounced than that of circus animals who receive their little longed-for pieces.</p><p>
After the bear had planted the little tree on Volodya’s orders, he looked intently at him, shifting from one paw to the other, as if he wanted to repeat the work he’d just done or carry out some different task. Strange, that a huge taiga bear really wanted to do something else for a person, and not just a person, but one who was still a child.</p><p>
Volodya didn’t give the bear any new task. He summoned the beast to him with a gesture, took hold of the fur on his snout with his hands and tousled it lightly, then petted the bear’s snout and said, “You’re my good boy, not like those goats.” The bear roared with pleasure. The tone of this roaring was such that it seemed like this fearsome beast was experiencing the very heights of bliss.</p><p>
Anastasia has said, “An invisible, beneficial energy can emanate from a person. Every living thing on earth needs it the way it needs air, sun and water. And even the light of the sun is merely a reflection of the great energy that emanates from people.”</p><p>
Our science has discovered a multitude of energies and has even learned to produce electric power, split atoms and make bombs, all on its own. But in what ways and to what extent has science advanced when it comes to what’s more significant and more important – the study of the energy that emanates from man? Is there even a branch of science that’s studying this energy and its mysterious potentials - the potentials of man as a whole and his life’s purpose in our world and in the Universe?</p><p>
Maybe someone is using every possible means to prevent man from coming to know himself? Precisely to prevent him from doing this.</p><p>
It can’t be man’s life’s purpose to spend years sitting in a casino or a bar with a shot of vodka. It just can’t be. To spend years sitting behind a cash register in a store or working as an office manager. And even a top model or a president or a singer isn’t being drawn toward man’s central life’s purpose.</p><p>
But it’s precisely these modern professions and making money that “something” promotes as the most important thing in man’s life. Most movies and television shows talk about them… There’s no contemplation at all of the essence of existence. They’re turning men into imbeciles.</p><p>
Isn’t that why there’s war, first here, then there? And why the earth is becoming more and more polluted? And why people, having lost their way and not seeing the meaning of life, drink vodka and use narcotics?</p><p>
Who should put a stop to this bacchanal on earth? Science? But it remains silent. Religion? Which religion? Where are the seeds? Perhaps each person has to think all of this over. On his own. Think it over! In order to think something over, one has to think. But where? And when? Because when you think about it, our life is nothing but a constant bustle.</p><p>
Even attempts to discuss the topic of the meaning of human existence are instantly cut off. Want to sell a magazine with half-naked, lewd bodies? Go right ahead. Or savor sexual perversions? Go right ahead. Or show and tell about the atrocities of perverted maniacs? Go right ahead. Or write about prostitutes and discuss them on the air? Go right ahead.</p><p>
But while this is going on, the topic of the meaning of man’s life and his life’s purpose is touched on less and less. This topic is becoming more and more forbidden.</p><p>
I broke off my reflection and glanced at my son. He was sitting next to me on the grass, watching me attentively. He probably wants to show me something else, I thought. I asked:</p><p>
“Volodya, what was it you said to the bear about the goats?”</p><p>
“Papa, I just haven’t been able to figure out what their purpose is.”</p><p>
“What’s there to figure out? Anyone can see that their purpose is to give humans milk.”</p><p>
“Yes, milk. But perhaps we could also teach them to do something?”</p><p>
“What else? And why?”</p><p>
“I’ve been watching them. Goats can also strip the bark off trees and stumps. And they can bite branches off bushes. Let them onto a homestead, and they can harm the plants. But so that won’t happen, I’m trying to teach them to trim the living fences on homesteads.”</p><p>
“To trim them?”</p><p>
“Yes, Papa, trim. You know how people trim bushes to make them pretty, or trim them into a little wall or into figures. Grandfather’s told me about that – they call it landscape design where you are. But the goats just can’t manage to understand what I want from them.”</p><p>
“How are you teaching them?”</p><p>
“I’ll show you right now.”</p><p>
Volodya took a roughly three-meter long rope he’d woven out of nettle fibers, tied one end to a small tree and stretched the rope across the bushes. Then he motioned to two nanny goats to come over to him, petted each of them, touched the bushes with his hand and even bit off one little twig himself. He said something to the goats, and they began gnawing energetically at the branches of the bushes. As soon as the goats would come to the border defined by the rope, Volodya would tug on the rope a few times and make some sounds in a dissatisfied tone. The goats would stop what they were doing for a bit and extend their little snouts and look at my son questioningly, but before long they’d start gnawing the branches of the bushes once more, paying no attention to the rope.</p><p>
“You see, Papa, it’s not working. They don’t understand that they need to trim the bushes evenly along the rope.”</p><p>
“Yes, I see. And so that’s what your problem is?”</p><p>
“That’s not the main problem, Papa. The main problem is something else.”</p><p>
“What?”</p><p>
“Did you notice, Papa, how gladly the various beasts came running when I called?”</p><p>
“Yes.”</p><p>
“I’ve been working with them for more than just one year, and they’ve gotten used to interacting with me, and only with me. They look forward to our interactions and they want the affection. And when I leave to go to your world they’ll pine away. Because a person won’t be coming to see them, won’t summon them ever again, won’t ask them to do anything. I’ve gotten the sense that interacting with a person and serving a person have become the main point of their life.”</p><p>
“But couldn’t they interact with Anastasia?”</p><p>
“Mama has her own circle, her own beasts that she’s friends with. Besides, she’s also busy, and she doesn’t have time enough for everyone.</p><p>
“And I myself selected these ones,” – he indicated the wild animals still sitting at the edge of the glade – “and have been working with them all on my own for several years. And now three months have already passed since I asked Grandfather to always attend the lessons with me. Even though Grandfather grumbles, he’s always been right alongside me here, but not long ago he said that he can’t replace me.”</p><p>
“Why not?”</p><p>
“Grandfather told me, ‘I don’t have your interest in animal training.’ And then he started grumbling about how I shouldn’t have spent so much time working with them on my own. And that I shouldn’t pet them a lot. And besides, that these beasts consider me not only their leader, but a child, too, because the older ones always saw me when I was little and would look after me. All in all, I made some kind of mistake, and now I have to fix it. Only, at this point I won’t be able to fix it on my own.”</p><p>
I looked at the beasts that were still sitting in the glade. From the look of it, they expected Volodya to give them some kind of orders or training. I imagined how they’d pine away. The way my dog Cedra pines away when I leave my country house for a few days or weeks. Her doghouse is warm, and I don’t tie her up, and she can walk around in the field, the woods or the village. And my neighbor feeds her every day. He cooks kasha for her and gives her bones. But my neighbor say, ‘She pines away without you, Vladimir Nikolaevich. She often sits by the gate and gazes out onto the road you take when you come back, and sometimes she whines.’ When I arrive, Cedra runs headlong up to me and knocks into my legs, and sometimes, because she’s bursting with emotion, she jumps up and tries to lick my face and dirties my clothes with her paws in the process. And I just can’t teach her to be more restrained about expressing her emotions.</p><p>
But those wild animals sitting in the glade… The whole time my son and I were talking, they looked at us silently, outwardly calm. What did they want? After all, no one was forcing them to sit like that and await some order or other from a person… My God… A thought flashed brightly and caught hold of my soul. It wasn’t just these wild animals sitting on the taiga glade… but all wild animals on earth that have their life’s purpose and are waiting for contact with the planet’s highest being – man. They were created to help man fulfill his most lofty mission. God created them, just as he created every living thing on the planet, to help man realize his great mission… But man…</p><p>
I looked at the animals sitting in the taiga glade and began to understand: my son really was facing a serious problem. He couldn’t just abandon these animals for no good reason, and he also couldn’t give up his dream of the girl with whom he’d build a homestead.</p><p>
“Yes, Volodya, this really is a problem. And it seems it can’t be solved. You can’t find a way out,” I told my son.</p><p>
“There is a way out, but it doesn’t depend on me.”</p><p>
“On whom, then?”</p><p>
“The only one who can solve this problem is you, Papa.”</p><p>
“Me? But how? I can’t do anything here, Son.”</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>There Is a Way Out</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>“I think you’ll be able to help me, Papa, if you want to,” Volodya declared quietly.</p><p>
“You think so? But I don’t know what I should do, you see? You think I can help, but I don’t know.”</p><p>
I was sitting on the grass. My son stood before me and looked into my eyes with kind of pleading look, and his lips soundlessly whispered something. Judging by his lips, he was very quietly pronouncing one word again and again. Then, speaking distinctly, without shifting his gaze away from me, he announced:</p><p>
“A little sister. I ask you, Papa, with all my heart, you and Mama: give me a little sister. I’ll look after her myself and raise her. They’ll help me. We won’t distract you and Mama from your work. I’ll teach her when she gets a little older. I’ll tell her about it. She’ll stay with my wild animals, in my space. Please give birth to a little sister for me with Mama. If you’re not sick, of course… or too tired. If you’re able to, of course. Grandfather told me that because of your way of life and the inhuman air and the awful water, men in your world frequently get sick and age quickly. You’re a little more than fifty years old, Papa. But if you’re tired, Papa… If you’ve used up a lot of your strength. Then three days. Only three days. I’ve already gotten everything ready, and you’ll get a lot of your strength back.”</p><p>
My son was agitated, and I interrupted him.</p><p>
“Hold on, Volodya, calm down. Of course, I’m a bit tired. But I think I can find some more strength. That’s not what concerns me. In general I’m not at all opposed to you having a little sister, but to have children, both parents have to want it.”</p><p>
“I’m certain, Papa. I know for sure that Mama won’t refuse to bear you a child. If you agree, then let’s start preparing for my little sister’s birth right now, so as to not waste any time. I’ve done some studying. Grandfather has helped me out with a lot of it. I’ve done the calculations and gotten everything ready. Spend three days and three nights with me and don’t go off anywhere or get distracted by anything, Papa. You’ll have added energy and strength.”</p><p>
“Volodya, what makes you think I don’t have enough of them?”</p><p>
“I think you have enough, but you’ll have more.”</p><p>
“Okay, I’ll spend all three days only with you, but we have to go let Mama know.”</p><p>
“I’ll explain everything to her myself, Papa. I’ll tell her we’re working on something together. She won’t ask for details or start objecting.”</p><p>
“All right, then, let’s get started.”</p><p>
Now I’d actually even begun to wonder what in the world my son had concocted that could restore a great deal of strength and energy to a person in the space of just three days. And I’ll say right away that the treatments he prepared for me might seem a bit odd, but the feeling I got from them by the third day defy simple description in words or in writing. And to say that a person gets ten or twenty years younger doesn’t quite fit, either. Maybe you’ll only look about five years younger on the outside. But on the inside… Somehow everything started working in a different way inside. There was new strength, and the surrounding world was a bit different, too.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0804>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>4. A Return to Youth</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The First Treatment</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>As soon as I agreed to undergo the procedures my son had thought up, he immediately gave his wild animals the sign “go away.” He took me by the hand, and we ran to the lake. We stopped several times along the way. Volodya picked blades of grass in various spots, crushed them, and rolled them into a little ball. When the little ball was ready, he presented it to me to eat. I ate it. And here’s what happened within only a few minutes: my nose began to run very strongly and I began to vomit. I vomited so much that it seemed as if all the gastric juices had come out of my stomach. I was vomiting and in no condition to say anything, and Volodya explained:</p><p>
“That’s good, Papa. Don’t be afraid. It’s good. Allow all the impurities to come out of you. Only what’s pure will remain. This is what they do when someone’s been poisoned.”</p><p>
Physically I was in no condition to say anything in response, but I thought to myself, “That’s right, when someone’s poisoned, they take some pills that cause nausea and vomiting, and there are laxatives, castor oil, for example. But why do I need this treatment? After all, I haven’t been poisoned.”</p><p>
As if hearing my question, Volodya explained:</p><p>
“Of course you haven’t been poisoned, Papa, but you take in food that borders on being poisonous. Let all the toxins come out of you.”</p><p>
After the vomiting, the discharge of phlegm from my nose, and a voluminous flow of tears from my eyes, I began experiencing a soft stool, and I ran off into the bushes for long periods, about five times. All of this went on for two to three hours. Then came relief.</p><p>
“Now you’re feeling better, Papa? Better than before? Isn’t that right?”</p><p>
“Yes,” I confirmed.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Second Treatment</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>Volodya grabbed me by the hand once more and we set off running. At the shore of the lake, Volodya suggested we have a wash and a bit of a swim. When I came out of the water, I saw him pulling a clay jug, about a liter and a half in size, out of the ground.</p><p>
“Now, Papa, you need to drink this water. It’s called dead water. That’s because there are very few microbes in it. You can’t drink this kind of water if the air is polluted. But the air here is clean, and so you can drink dead water here. It will flush out your insides, cleanse them, flush many microbes and bacteria out of your system. Drink it, Papa, as much of it as you can. When you’ve drunk the whole jug, I’ll give you another jug of dead water. When you’ve drunk that one, too, I’ll give you a third jug – with living water in it. And all the necessary germs and bacteria will be restored in just the right balance for you.”</p><p>
Let me explain one thing right away: what they consider dead water is water that’s found at a great underground depth and contains a minimum of bacteria. I think our bottled carbonated water is exactly that – dead water. And I think that in general, we drink only dead water, and that’s why our children, and especially newborns, suffer from dysbacteriosis.</p><p>
What’s considered living water is surface water from a pure stream or reservoir.</p><p>
Such streams and reservoirs have been preserved deep in the Siberian taiga.</p><p>
I want to make one point. Grandfather later explained, that at the moment when you drink water from a spring, that water isn’t considered living water. If you want it to become living, you need to keep it in a wide-mouth wooden or clay vessel for about three hours. “Living water needs to absorb sunlight. When it’s in the sun, organisms that a person needs in order to live arise. You call them microbes and bacteria.”</p><p>
Then the water needs to stand in the shade for no less than three hours. At that point you can drink it as living water.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Third Treatment</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>“Papa, drink the water when you feel like drinking, and meanwhile we’ll move on to the next procedure. In general, people who have been contaminated by the outer world need to carry out all these procedures over the course of nineteen days, although thirty-three days is better. That’s what Grandfather said. But you don’t have that much time, so I’ve condensed everything into three days, but we’ll manage. Come with me to a different spot, where I’ve constructed a certain apparatus.”</p><p>
We walked about a hundred meters away from the lake, and there, amongst the trees, I saw that a makeshift bed had been prepared out of dry grass. Four ropes woven out of nettle or flax fibers lay alongside it.</p><p>
There was a loop at one end of the ropes, and each rope’s other end was tied to the trees. When I lay down on the makeshift bed, Volodya slipped the rope loops over my hands and feet, tightened them a bit and began to pull them tighter using small sticks located in the middle of each rope. Once he’d tightened them a little, as if quartering my body, he gave each hand and foot a tug. We could hear a crunching sound in the joints. Then he tightened the ropes once more and said:</p><p>
“Papa, you’ll need to lie for at least an hour on your stomach and at least an hour on your back, and so you won’t get bored lying that way, and so you’ll get a lot of benefit from it, I’ll give you a therapeutic massage at the same time. And if you want to, you can relax and take a nap.”</p><p>
My son and I performed this procedure over the course of two hours on all three days.</p><p>
As I later learned from Grandfather, this procedure helps improve lubrication of all the joints. It’s particularly important for elderly people. It can even help increase your height, since the spine straightens out. But the main thing is that joint lubrication improves. Judge for yourself: when we walk, run, and work out at the gym doing weight-lifting, nearly all those exercises are associated with increased stress on the joints. And here it’s the opposite: that stress is removed.</p><p>
Volodya gave me a massage each time we did the stretching procedure. On the second day he rubbed my body with some kind of sweet juice or infusion, and a lot of insects began swarming over me. I knew from my conversations with Anastasia that they were cleaning out the pores of my skin. Where we live, we can clean out the pores of the skin with the help of a Russian bathhouse and a birch twig. When a person steams in the bathhouse and sweats, the pores are cleaned out at the same time. Between the procedures we conventionally called “stretching,” we would do some pretty ordinary exercises: we’d run, swim and do chin-ups on tree branches, the way you would on a horizontal bar. About three times each day Volodya would have me stand on my hands, head down, for as long as I could manage it. And I’d stand there, my legs leaning against a tree trunk. This procedure was also quite interesting: a lot of blood rushes to your face, it tightens up, and the wrinkles smooth out.</p><p>
All three days we nourished ourselves with cedar milk, flower pollen, cedar nut oil, berries and a few dried mushrooms (all of which we’d be able to find where we live.) In general, as I was going through all the procedures my son suggested to me, I was mentally adapting them to our conditions, and I came to the conclusion that we can effectively implement these practices at home, too. We can also obtain preparations for cleansing our system at pharmacies. We can implement fasting and use diuretics. It’s also not at all complicated to find dead water: all bottled water is dead now. And you can also get living water, if there’s a pure spring somewhere nearby.</p><p>
You’ll definitely experience an improvement in your health.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>A Mysterious Procedure</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>But among the combination of procedures prescribed by my son, there was also a mysterious procedure, one that would be totally problematic to put into practice in our living conditions. Maybe someone will figure out how you could put it into practice in our conditions and will tell me. It consisted of this: three times a day – in the morning, before lunch, and pretty much right after three o’clock in the afternoon – Volodya would have me drink an infusion he’d prepared.</p><p>
Whenever it was time for me to drink it, Volodya would run off to his hiding-place and take the little jug containing this infusion out of its hole. He’d have me take a sip from the jug, but no more than one swallow. As he was giving me the infusion for the first time, he said:</p><p>
“Take a drink of this infusion, Papa, and take note of how big a swallow you take. As soon as you drink it, lie down on the grass, and I’ll listen to how your heart responds.”</p><p>
I took a drink and lay down on the grass. Volodya placed his hand on my chest and sat there motionless. Within a few moments I already began to feel sensations in various parts of my body: in some spots, warmth, in others, tingling. My heart began to beat more strongly. It wasn’t that it began to beat more often. Rather, I had the sensation that the heart muscle was expanding as usual, but that it was contracting much more strongly, forcefully pushing out the blood.</p><p>
As specialists later told me, when blood moves more strongly and forcefully through parts of the body where the capillaries are partially blocked, sensations of warmth or tingling can arise.</p><p>
Volodya listened to my heartbeat for several minutes and then said:</p><p>
“Everything’s good, Papa. Your heart can even stand a big swallow. But it’s better not to risk it. The next time, take a slightly smaller swallow.”</p><p>
When I asked my son why he was giving me this infusion and what it was made of, he answered me in this way:</p><p>
“This infusion, Papa, will give you a lot of strength and will help cure you of illnesses, if any are present in you. But the main thing is that your strength will be revived, and the energy that’s needed for my sister’s birth will arise.”</p><p>
“What, do you think I don’t have enough of that?”</p><p>
“Perhaps you do have enough. But now you definitely have a lot of strength, and you’ll have all the energies in the necessary proportions.”</p><p>
“Will I always have them, or will I use them all up on the birth of one child?”</p><p>
“You’ll need to drink this infusion again for the birth of subsequent children. That’s what they do each time.”</p><p>
“Who ‘they’?”</p><p>
“Sables and other animals. I’ve only tracked the sable. That’s what Grandfather suggested I do – he told me when, at what time of day and precisely how many days I had to track him.”</p><p>
“And how does Grandfather know all of this?”</p><p>
“Well, Papa, our Grandfather possesses all the knowledge of the great wisemen-priests. And even knowledge that’s been forgotten by today’s priests. And even knowledge that was secret many thousands of years ago. Priests would use this infusion before the birth of their children and before death, so as to remain immortal.”</p><p>
“What do you mean by ‘before death, so as to remain immortal’?”</p><p>
“Well, it’s like this. So that everyone would think they’d died. But in actual fact, they were only exchanging their bodies and would incarnate immediately, and all the knowledge remained in them, all the information. There are also other ways of reincarnating quickly, but very few ways of preserving the information within us. That’s why people are born again and have to study life and learn everything, and they’re unable to compare today’s world with the past. And they get confused in life because they have no knowledge about life in them, and no feelings capable of sensing God.”</p><p>
“So you’re saying that in Grandfather, all the information about the past has been preserved?”</p><p>
“Yes, Papa. Our Grandfather is a great priest and wise man. There’s only one person alive on the earth today who immeasurably surpasses him in power.”</p><p>
“Where is he living now, this most powerful and wise one, do you know? That must be the head priest, right?”</p><p>
“It’s our mama Anastasia, Papa.”</p><p>
“Anastasia? But where can she have come by more information and knowledge than her great-grandfather?”</p><p>
“Grandfather says that he’s hindered by his excessively large volume of information. And he might forget something. But this doesn’t hinder Mama the tiniest bit, because she doesn’t have any information in her.”</p><p>
“How am I to understand that? On the one hand she knows more, but on the other she doesn’t have information at all?”</p><p>
“I didn’t express myself well, Papa. Mama-Anastasia possesses all information… Well, all told… She possesses a lot more information, but it’s compressed into feelings. And when she needs to, in the space of an instant, she’s capable of feeling what Grandfather would have to think about for a day or two, or maybe even longer.”</p><p>
“I don’t understand everything you’ve told me, but it’s interesting. Tell me more. But what about you? Don’t you have the information about the past within you, since you consult with Grandfather?”</p><p>
“No. Since I consult with him, it means I don’t.”</p><p>
“But why not? So you mean you’re intellectually weaker than they are? Than Great-Grandfather and Grandfather? And what do they say to you about that? Grandfather probably says it’s my fault?”</p><p>
“Grandfather hasn’t said anything like that to me.”</p><p>
“What about Mama? What has she said?”</p><p>
“I asked Mama why I know less than my great-grandfathers. And less than her, and than you, Papa. She responded by saying, ‘Son, all the truths of the Universe, all the information that’s been collected from the wellspring people has always been openly granted to every man. Not all people are capable of understanding it and taking it in, because the goal of their life and the aspirations of their soul don’t correspond to the aspirations of the Universe. Man is free and is always free to choose, and he has the right to choose his own path – not that of the Universe. But God has freedom, too, the freedom to choose when and whom to help out a bit, and how. Don’t be sad about the knowledge you lack. Seek out your dream and believe that everything will be granted to you in full if this dream born in you is worthy of creation.”</p><p>
“Yes… Well, and so what did you get out of what Mama said, Volodya?”</p><p>
“When I create my dream and my life’s goal in detail, then all the knowledge I need in order to make my dream a reality will be born in me.”</p><p>
“And so for now you’ll consult with Grandfather?”</p><p>
“Yes, with Grandfather and Mama and with you, and I myself will try to ponder it, too.”</p><p>
“So that means you’ll have to ask Grandfather about the recipe for the unusual infusion you had me drink for three days?”</p><p>
“Oh, I can tell you all about that, Papa.”</p><p>
“Tell me, then.”</p><p>
“The recipe consists of taiga herbs. In order to know which herbs to pick and in what proportions, I tracked a sable for three days and nights. A sable that also wanted to become a papa. Grandfather told me that a female sable won’t let the male near her if he hasn’t prepared himself. And I watched to see what herbs he’d eat on those days, and which time of day he’d choose to pluck them. And this also ended up being important. All the herbs he ate – I collected them, except that I had to collect a little more of the herbs because, after all, Papa, you weigh a lot more than a sable.</p><p>
“I put all the herbs I’d collected bit by bit into a mortar and ground them until they began to release their juice. And as I was doing this, I thought only about nice and good things: about you, Papa, about Mama, about my future little sister. Then I placed the mash I’d made into a clay jug. I poured water over the contents of the jug and added some cedar oil so it would form a skin on the top. When you drank a sip of the infusion, Papa, and your heart began beating a little faster, I knew the infusion had come out well.”</p><p>
I listened to my son and thought, “Very few people would have the opportunity to observe a sable in its natural habitat. But maybe one could make a note of what kind of herbs a dog, say, or cat would eat.</p><p>
“In order to do that you’d have to take them out into the forest and watch their behavior and, if possible, determine which herbs they ate.”</p><p>
I was very intrigued by the recipe of the infusion my son had prepared, because after using it for only three days there was a noticeable effect. Now, my son had mentioned that a full course of treatment should consist of either 19 or 33 days. That means that after a full course, including the exercises, too, a person really can cure himself of many complaints, slow the body’s aging or grow younger in some way. Let me repeat: practicing even a three-day regimen confirms that such an effect is possible.</p><p>
But there’s folk wisdom, too, and a scientific basis for this claim.</p><p>
Of course, in pharmacies, people come across herbal preparations that our pharmaceutical industry offers as cures for all manner of illnesses. And many people know that a great number of medicinal plants exist in nature. But not everyone knows that you can receive a plant’s true medicinal, preventative or healing effect if you pick it on a specific day or at a specific hour.</p><p>
As far as herbal preparations are concerned, then along with everything else, you also have to consider the ratio of each of the medicinal herbs to each other. As we can see, you have to know too many components if you want to make a preparation like this one. It’s highly unlikely that any contemporary herbalists would even know all these components.</p><p>
I really wanted to give my readers a gift this time – a recipe for improving the health of their organism that had never before been published in the world, and one that wasn’t as complicated as my son’s, and that the majority of people could easily understand and access.</p><p>
As soon as I’d completed the three-day regimen my son had devised, he announced that he wanted to go to sleep a bit earlier – it turned out that over all three nights he hadn’t slept more than two or three hours total – and he fell asleep. And I immediately set off for Anastasia’s glade. There were two questions that interested me most: why didn’t our son possess knowledge of the past the way Grandfather did? And the second: could the recipe for the infusion he’d prepared for me be simplified?</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>A Vision</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>But thoughts of nutrition gradually receded into the background. I began thinking about my future daughter. On the one hand, it wouldn’t be bad at all for Anastasia to give birth to a daughter, too. But on the other hand, our daughter would grow up, and she’d have her own space, or she’d inherit the space our son had established, and then she’d have to face the very same problems Volodya was now facing. And besides, whom would she marry, out here in the taiga?</p><p>
She wouldn’t find it easy to leave and go into our world, either. Leaving would mean abandoning her space and her devoted wild animal friends. It was unlikely that any young man would agree to live with her in the taiga: it’s not very comfortable for someone to come from the outside and live here, deep in the taiga. To tell the truth, it wasn’t even very comfortable for me. It’s interesting to spend time with Anastasia. She even has a way of drawing you to her: when you’re next to her, you being to feel tranquil and joyful in your soul. But when you’re left alone, when she’s not around, then it’s uncomfortable and even a little bit frightening.</p><p>
The wild animals treat Anastasia, our son and me totally differently. Of course, they don’t attack me, but they look at me warily when I happen upon them. There have been times when Anastasia was there that I tried ordering squirrels to bring me cedar cones. I did the same gestures as Anastasia, but the squirrels didn’t respond. One time I tried to call the she-wolf. I stretched my arm out in her direction, just the way Anastasia does, and then slapped my hand against my leg. But instead of running to me, the wolf remained standing right where she was, and her fur stood on end aggressively. And I lost all desire to have anything more to do with these beasts. I understood that they would ever only be devoted to one specific person.</p><p>
And so here’s how it will go: some young man will come to visit my daughter and he’ll be uncomfortable in her space. Volodya hadn’t thought about his sister’s future. You see, it turns out that he felt sorry for the beasts, but not for his sister. And I hadn’t thought about that either when I was so quick to give him hope.</p><p>
Lost in thought about this, I didn’t even notice that I’d gotten to Anastasia’s glade. Taking a few steps toward the familiar dug-out, I glimpsed Anastasia, standing half-turned toward me, combing her hair with her fingers, and I stopped. She didn’t look like the woman I’d known for ten years already. And when she turned to face me, I basically suddenly felt weak in the knees, my heartbeat quickened, and I understood that I couldn’t move from that spot.</p><p>
Ten to fifteen steps from me stood a woman who looked like a fairytale vision. She was wearing a long, thin, light colored dress that reached to her ankles, something like a ball gown, tied with a little belt on her narrow waist. A garland woven of grasses and flowers, reminiscent of a diadem, adorned her head. Her golden hair cascaded to her shoulders in waves. But that wasn’t the main thing. Her stately figure and her face were so beautiful that they defied all description.</p><p>
I stood, afraid to move. I gazed at Anastasia, without blinking, and it seemed that if I looked away, I’d lose consciousness. My head began to spin, but I continued to gaze at her, without blinking. I dug my nails into my hand with all my strength, so that the pain would bring me out of this unusual state. But I barely felt the pain. And when this unusually beautiful woman began slowly and gracefully walking toward me, I stopped feeling not just the pain, but even my body. Slowly, she walked almost right up to me. I recall how I become aware of the captivating scent of her body, how I felt her light breath and… I lost consciousness.</p><p>
When I came to, I was lying on the grass. Anastasia was sitting alongside me, massaging my temples and the bridge of my nose. The diadem garland was no longer on her head, and her hair was pulled back and tied with a blade of grass. Looking into her tender, gray blue eyes that had grown so familiar to me, I calmed down almost entirely. And I totally came to again when I heard her voice:</p><p>
“What’s happened with you, Vladimir? Did you wear yourself out, or did our son cause you some worry?”</p><p>
“Our son? No, quite the contrary, he’s been curing me these past three days. We carried out various procedures.”</p><p>
“And you got all worn out?”</p><p>
“Volodya got all worn out. He’s fallen asleep. I’m just the opposite – I’ve started feeling very good.”</p><p>
“So then why did you lose consciousness? Your heart was beating faster and it still hasn’t entirely calmed down.”</p><p>
“It’s because… But Anastasia, why did you get dressed up in that unusual way? You did your hair some different way. And the way you walked, when you were coming toward me, that was also unusual.”</p><p>
“I wanted to do something nice for you, Vladimir. After all, you’re used to seeing women who are dressed up. I thought you and I could take a walk through the taiga or along the lake. But you’re just lying here. If you want to have a rest, let’s go to the dug-out and you can have a nap.”</p><p>
“First let’s go take a walk, the way you wanted,” I said, getting to my feet. “But Anastasia, can you please just walk behind me?”</p><p>
“Why?”</p><p>
“Because. Even though of course, I am more used to seeing women who are dressed up, it would be better for you not to dress up like that or do your hair that way, or adorn yourself that way.”</p><p>
“You didn’t like it, Vladimir?” Anastasia asked, walking behind me.</p><p>
“That’s not it. I liked it. But next time just do everything little by little. For example, first change your hair. And walk around like that for a while. Then put on your diadem garland and then, a day or two later, the dress, but without the belt, and then you can put on the belt. If you do everything at once, it’s kind of unfamiliar. It seems unusual.”</p><p>
“Unusual. Do you mean to say you didn’t recognize me, Vladimir?”</p><p>
“I recognized you. But… Well, I was just bowled over by your beauty, Anastasia.”</p><p>
“Aha! You admit it! You admit it. So, you mean you consider me beautiful? Do you?”</p><p>
I felt her lay her hands lightly on my shoulders, and I stopped. Then I closed my eyes, turned around, and answered her:</p><p>
“Anastasia, you are not simply beautiful. You…”</p><p>
She snuggled up against me and laid her head on my shoulder.</p><p>
“Anastasia, our son wants a little sister,” I continued, speaking in a whisper.</p><p>
“And I, too, want us to have a daughter, Vladimir,” Anastasia answered quietly.</p><p>
“May she look like you, Anastasia.”</p><p>
“And may our daughter look like you, too…”</p><p>
</p><p>I’m not going to describe that night. Or that morning, either. They are impossible to describe. But there is one thing I’d like to say to men: if any one of you has the great good fortune to glimpse a goddess in a woman you know, then both your night and your day, and many, many days and nights, will be divine. Your past miseries will fade in their presence. And you’ll never have a cloudy day. And the reason has nothing to do with centimeters or words or pretty declarations. What it has to do with is…</p><p>
On second thought, each one of you can figure that out for yourself, if you can, or if you want to.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0805>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>5. Divine Nourishment</p></h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>
It wasn’t until several days later that I remembered that I’d wanted to talk with Anastasia and find out the recipe for the curative infusion and, basically, find out about a diet for our readers, a way for them to eat right. It seems that Anastasia knew about a quite unusual and unique way of eating that was suitable even for an urban setting.</p><p>
To my amazement, instead of immediately giving me the recipe for the infusion, Anastasia began talking about man’s capabilities, about sick people and about healers. This wasn’t the first time we’d spoken on this topic, but what she told me this time was very interesting.</p><p>
“Vladimir, we need to determine reality solely through ourselves. Every person living on Earth is capable of seeing the lives of people from thousands of years ago, of peering into the future, of building his own future life. Each person has within him such a great capability. We need to comprehend it, and once you do, then no one can lead you away from the truth. People will come to agreement with each other, and the endless wars will cease.</p><p>
“A great deal of effort has been expended in order to distort the reality of the past. And the possibility of distortion arises when a person constructs his impressions of the past not on his own, but out of the conclusions and words of someone else.”</p><p>
“Anastasia, I don’t quite understand how each person living on Earth can find out on his own about the life of people from centuries gone by, to say nothing of those from thousands of years ago. There’s an entire science devoted to studying the origins of mankind. But even to this day scientists argue about man’s origins, about his life’s purpose. They interpret historical events in various ways.”</p><p>
“In various ways. Do you mean, then, that there are accurate and inaccurate interpretations? Perhaps they all speak of the past in error? As a rule, errors are created for the benefit of someone or other. But when you yourself reconstruct within you the pictures of the past, all on your own – then you’ll see the truth, and you’ll determine your own life’s purpose and your place in the Universe.”</p><p>
“But for example, how can I myself see historical pictures of past millennia?”</p><p>
“You have to produce them through logical reflection. And then even the life of the Vedic Russians will appear before you.”</p><p>
“What is it I need to reflect on logically?”</p><p>
“On the images of the people you’ve seen in the course of your half century of life, and on what changes have taken place in them.”</p><p>
“I’m not very clear on how I’m supposed to reflect.”</p><p>
“It will be clear to you if you aren’t too lazy to think. Come on, Vladimir, we’ll start together, then you’ll continue on your own. And each person can reconstruct pictures from the past, so that they can integrate them into a better future.”</p><p>
“All right then, but you go first.”</p><p>
“I’ll go first. You look, and if you can, contribute some details, because they’re important. Today you see a great number of hospitals, and pharmacies with medicines for thousands of diseases.”</p><p>
“Yes, everyone can see that. So what?”</p><p>
“Try to recall – were there fewer of them, even just thirty years ago?”</p><p>
“Yes, of course.”</p><p>
“And how many of them were there a hundred, or two hundred, years ago?”</p><p>
“A great deal fewer still. Everyone knows that modern medical science is only a little more than two hundred years old.”</p><p>
“See? It’s logic that led you to this conclusion: in the recent past there were absolutely no hospitals. Now, think and recall: who would treat people when they had a complaint?”</p><p>
“Who?”</p><p>
“Well, you yourself lived in a village, and you saw your grandmother giving your father and mother herbal decoctions to drink.”</p><p>
“My grandmother wasn’t the only one in that village who was able to treat people. There were others, too.”</p><p>
“And in each settlement you would certainly come across people who would collect and store medicinal herbs. And each person could receive help without delay if he had a slight complaint or a serious illness. And only meager payment was offered in exchange for this help. Often the words ‘thank you’ served as payment.”</p><p>
“Well sure. They were neighbors, after all. And there were tons of different herbs around.”</p><p>
“Yes, there were many beneficial herbs. And many people knew about the properties of those herbs.”</p><p>
“Of course they did. I knew about some of them, too, but now I’ve forgotten.”</p><p>
“You see? You’ve forgotten, and many people have forgotten. Today, if a person gets a cut on his body, what does he do?”</p><p>
“He goes to the pharmacy and buys a bandage or an anti-bacterial band aid and sticks it on the cut.”</p><p>
“He’ll spend time getting to the pharmacy, and then he’ll spend money. Meanwhile, in the past every child knew that if you lay a plantain leaf on the cut, then the cut will heal quickly and there will be no infection.”</p><p>
“I know that, too, but now the grass in many places is dirty. We’re surrounded by car exhaust fumes, dust, and acid rain.”</p><p>
“Yes, that’s true. But that’s not the point. We’re talking about an image from bygone days, and you can draw a conclusion from that: the knowledge that the man of the past possessed about healing surpasses the knowledge of today’s people.”</p><p>
“That seems to be the case.”</p><p>
“I’m hearing some notes of doubt or uncertainty in your voice, Vladimir. No image will appear to you that way. You need to be completely certain. Or completely reject it. Continue to follow the logic in your mind.”</p><p>
“You see, Anastasia, logically everything supports the fact that the man of the past possessed significantly greater knowledge in the area of folk medicine than people today. You could even say, immeasurably greater. So what you’re left with is that medical care offered through this knowledge was significantly more advanced than today’s. But I kind of have a hard time wrapping my mind around the idea that we don’t need all these modern hospitals, pharmacies and scientific institutions. But heavens, that’s the way it turns out! When a person from the Vedic Russian civilization, our ancestor, happened to fall ill, he’d eat a blade of grass or drink an infusion and the ailment was removed. When a person from our civilization falls ill, he goes to the hospital, pays to be seen by a doctor, the doctor prescribes some pills or other, or a shot, and the person pays more money – often big money – for the medicine. But at the same time, there are many cases when these medicines turn out to be counterfeit. Officials from the Ministry of Health say that up to 30% of the medicines sold in pharmacies are counterfeit. And besides that, various incurable diseases crop up. It’s as if somebody on purpose destroyed this advanced wisdom and replaced it with illusory or less effective knowledge. By the way, today’s official medical establishment is wary of folk healers, too, probably because they’re competitors. But if mankind has for centuries and millennia effectively cured itself using folk medicine, then why don’t the government and the public understand that, that if this tremendous experience has accumulated over the centuries, then we need to develop it, study it? I mean, you could teach this knowledge in schools.</p><p>
“But then the whole business run by today’s medical establishment would collapse… Unbelievable! Anastasia! It’s unbelievable! I think I’m starting to get it: modern medicine isn’t so much in the business of treating people, as it’s in business in the most ordinary sense. And once we’re talking about a business, then it’s more lucrative for the companies that produce pills if people are sick. The greater the number of sick people, the greater their income. According to the laws of business, in such circumstances, the number of sick people will increase steadily. It’s a perverse system. I’m beginning to be convinced: in the distant past, health care was significantly more rational and effective. There are just a few historical facts that are keeping me from being fully convinced of this.”</p><p>
“What facts?”</p><p>
“Well, for example: outbreaks of epidemics of plague, smallpox and leprosy are known to have occurred in history. Some history textbooks tell us about how entire settlements were wiped out. Did that happen?”</p><p>
“Yes, it did.”</p><p>
“But now, with the help of modern medicine, plague, cholera and smallpox have been conquered. For example, everyone gets vaccinated against smallpox, and that’s it. That means the folk healers of the past weren’t able to fight these diseases, but modern medicine is.”</p><p>
“That’s not the case, Vladimir. Take a look at the timeframe for yourself and juxtapose some simple facts. The outbreaks of epidemics you mention began occurring at the point when healers began to be subjected to persecution. Many were even put to death. During the Occult period, they became unbeneficial to those in power. People used to think and they still do today, that the pagans worshiped nature and were not spiritual people. That’s not the case. The pagans respected nature as God’s creation. And they recognized a multitude of Divine creations that are unknown to people today.”</p><p>
“Enough, Anastasia. I don’t have any more doubts. Modern medical science is greatly inferior to the science of folk medicine. I’m convinced of that. But why were you trying so hard to convince me?”</p><p>
“Not only you. I want your readers, too, to be able to juxtapose the facts and comprehend this.”</p><p>
“But for what reason?”</p><p>
“When one fact becomes indisputable, then other indisputable conclusions will follow from it. They will seem unbelievable, but please, Vladimir, don’t be quick to be astonished.”</p><p>
“Well, give me an example. What kind of unbelievable conclusions?”</p><p>
“First answer a question for me. Tell me, what do the majority of people think: where do they think mankind back in ancient times acquired such colossal knowledge about nature?”</p><p>
“What do you mean where did they get it? If you’re talking about folk medicine recipes, then everyone knows they were passed down from generation to generation.”</p><p>
“All right, then, let’s say that’s the case: they were passed down once they were acquired. But surely you’ll agree that there had to be one original person who created each of those thousands of recipes.”</p><p>
“If you look at it logically, then of course there had to be, but now it’s impossible to determine who created these recipes.”</p><p>
“It is possible! All knowledge of the great creation was given to all people without exception by the Creator. I’ll prove that to you, Vladimir, and to all people. And don’t be quick to say that what I tell you is unbelievable.”</p><p>
“I’ll try my best. Tell me, then.”</p><p>
“It’s thought that in the beginning man was significantly less intelligent than now. That’s not the case, Vladimir. The wellspring people’s knowledge was Divine right from the beginning.”</p><p>
“From the beginning? But how can that be, Anastasia? What, God himself composed all the various recipes for herbal healing? Historians assert that mankind spent centuries accumulating its knowledge.”</p><p>
“But if you’re going to be completely logical, then you’ll have to draw a different conclusion based on that assertion.”</p><p>
“What conclusion?”</p><p>
“What follows logically is that man is not God’s perfect creation, but rather the least developed out of all beings alive on Earth.”</p><p>
“How do you get that?”</p><p>
“See for yourself. Your dog knows what kind of grass she needs to eat when she falls ill. And a cat knows: it runs into the forest to find the grass it needs. But no one at all wrote out recipes for them. A bee knows how to get nectar from a flower. How to build honeycombs and how to store honey in them, how to collect pollen. And how to raise its offspring. It knows this from the chain of knowledge given to the bee family, and if you remove even a single link, then the family will perish.</p><p>
“But bees still exist today. And that can mean only one thing: the Creator gave them all knowledge right at the start, in the moment of creation. This is why the bees didn’t perish, but instead have already lived for millions of years, and they build their unique honeycombs still today, just as they did on the first day of creation. And ants build their homes in just the same way. And a flower opens up its petals along with the sunrise, just as on the first day of creation. And the apple tree, the cherry tree and the pear tree also know precisely which of the earth’s juices they need in order to cultivate their fruits. All knowledge was given right at the beginning, in the moment of creation. And man is no exception to this rule.”</p><p>
“Yes… it’s unbelievable. The logic really does lead to such a conclusion. And that means… Wait a minute. But then where is this knowledge now?”</p><p>
“It is preserved within each person. And each person can himself compose a healthy recipe for a medicinal herbal infusion.”</p><p>
“But how?”</p><p>
“Because, Vladimir, God gave it to man right at the beginning. It is capable of curing the body of a multitude of diseases and of prolonging life. It’s extremely simple – and not simple. Man needs to grasp it with his mind. I’ll start with prehistoric times.”</p><p>
</p><p>“People in the Vedic Russian civilization all lived for more than a hundred years. And their flesh knew no illness whatsoever. They ate according to God’s prescription. Not to no end, and not for no reason, the Creator took the greatest care in designing the grasses, vegetables, berries and fruits so that they wouldn’t all ripen at once, but rather, one after the other in a strict sequence.</p><p>
“Some would ripen in early spring, others in the summer or in late autumn. The time of their ripening was determined by the moment at which each given produce could bring the greatest benefit to man. A person who lived on his family homestead and ate in accordance with God’s prescription could not fall ill. God determined for man the type of food he would eat and when he would eat it. Then the person himself would determine the amount of food he’d eat, but not with his mind – he’d eat as much as he wanted to eat. And his organism would precisely determine the necessary quantity of food, down to the gram.</p><p>
“In the autumn, each family would lay up provisions of berries, root vegetables, herbs, nuts and mushrooms. In the winter there would be a platter on the table in each hut. On the platter would be small mounds of these summer provisions. Each family member was busy with his own tasks, but whenever he felt hungry or thirsty, he’d go up to the table and without thinking about it, he’d take the food he needed. Take note, Vladimir: he’d take it without thinking about it. His organism knew precisely which food he needed and how much of it. God granted each person this capability. We can revive this capability now. All we need in order to do this is information.</p><p>
“I’ve adapted the Vedic Russian way of eating for today’s people. You can try it and others can, too. It is as follows.”</p><p>
</p><p>“A person living in a modern apartment needs to obtain a small quantity – one to two hundred grams each – of all the vegetables, fruits and edible grasses that grow in the area where he lives.</p><p>
“Before consuming these products, he should eat nothing at all for an entire day. He should drink spring water, and at lunchtime he should drink a glass of red beet juice. After drinking the beet juice, it’s desirable for him not to leave the house. An intensive cleansing of the stomach and bowels will begin.</p><p>
“The next morning, when the person wakes up and senses a feeling of hunger, he needs to take any vegetable, any fruit or herb he wants, place it on a plate, take a seat at the table and intently study the product lying on the plate, then sniff it, lick it, and eat it, chewing without hurrying. During this time, it’s desirable for him to be alone in the room and separate himself from sounds of the man-made world.</p><p>
“The feeling of hunger will not disappear when he consumes one product, or it will arise once more after a brief period of time. And then he needs to pick up any other product he wants and eat it the same way he ate the first one.</p><p>
“The person should try all of the products he’s acquired, in any order he wishes, but with short intervals in between.</p><p>
“The feeling of hunger will determine when to consume each subsequent food.</p><p>
“It’s essential to begin consuming the foods first thing in the morning.</p><p>
“In the course of a day, the person will have a chance to try all the foods that grow in the area where he lives. If the person ends up having a great variety of foods and one day won’t suffice, then he should continue to feed himself this same way the next day as well.</p><p>
“This procedure is very important. It will give many people’s organisms – perhaps for the first time in their lives – the chance to become acquainted with the taste and properties of each food, and to determine to what extent and in what quantity the person needs it at that moment.</p><p>
“Once the organism has had a chance to acquaint itself with all the foods, the person needs to take a big plate, cut up each vegetable into small slices and lay them out on the plate. He should also put out small bunches of greens and berries, either on this plate or a different one. If there’s a plate with perishable items, pour in enough spring water to cover them.</p><p>
“It’s also essential to put honey, flower pollen, cedar oil and spring water on the table. A person can go about his business. And when he senses a feeling of hunger, he can go up to the table and, with his hand or a wooden spoon, pick up the food he likes and eat it.</p><p>
“You might end up eating up absolutely all of some of the foods, while leaving others untouched. This indicates that your organism – your very wise personal doctor, the dietician that the Creator assigned to you – has selected what you most need at the given moment, leaving what you don’t need untouched for the time being.</p><p>
“The next day you don’t need to bother putting the foods you haven’t eaten on the table. But three days later, the full assortment of foods should appear on the table once more. It’s possible that now your organism will need something different.</p><p>
“The person will gradually be able to tell which foods he can omit from his rations for the time being, so as to not needlessly spend time acquiring them. But after some time passes, the organism might need them, too, so that’s why you need to put the full available assortment out on the table from time to time.</p><p>
“I know that a person living in your world often has to leave his dwelling place, but it’s possible to make some adjustments when this happens. For example, you can acquire or make a little birch bark box and put a portion of the food from the table into it. Your organism itself will select what it needs.</p><p>
“If you have to go away somewhere for a long time, then you’ll have to begin acquainting your organism in the same way with the produce from the new territory, since even though they may have the same names, they may differ from each other in taste.</p><p>
“You need to understand the most important point about this way of eating, Vladimir. It isn’t just all the wild animals that have been given the capability to determine which products are most beneficial for their organism and in what quantities, and at what moment they need them. Such knowledge also exists within each person.</p><p>
“Our son was correct in his thinking: so that he could concoct a curative infusion for you from the taiga herbs, he began tracking a sable. But if you yourself knew the taste of each blade of grass, then your organism would be able to select the necessary herbs a bit more accurately than a sable. When you return to your apartment, allow your organism to come to know the taste of the foods it’s easy for you to obtain. Don’t mix them together and don’t salt them. Otherwise your organism won’t be able to determine the virtue and importance of each food.”</p><p>
</p><p>This method that each person can use to put together his own diet or create a recipe for healthy eating seemed quite unique and logical to me. Because of course not all people’s organisms need the same assortment of foods in the same quantities. So it follows that there can’t be one standard prescription or diet for everyone. With the help of the method Anastasia offers, each person can put together a diet specifically for himself, one that will be maximally precise and beneficial. It seems that the recipes mankind has come up with aren’t always good for the health. Rather, they’re hi-tech and convenient for the modern food industry’s producers and directors. For example, McDonald’s is one of the most powerful and influential – and also one of the most widely known – corporations in the world, and it’s developed in the entire world a taste for identical hamburgers and cheeseburgers with fries in little bags, forcing a single standard menu on all people. This system is undoubtedly quite convenient for the producer: identical products, identical equipment, and identical production technology. This uniformity is so far removed from a natural way of eating, and so harmful. More and more people on this planet are beginning to understand this. In 2002, Wednesday, October 16 (United Nations World Food Day) became the official yearly day of protest against McDonald’s, a protest against: the passing off of by-products as food, the use of aggressive advertising directed at children, the cruel exploitation of workers, unethical treatment of animals, the destruction of the environment, and corporations’ world-wide domination of our lives.</p><p>
A wide circle of protestors throughout the world has begun to see McDonald more and more as a symbol of modern capitalism. One after another, across the whole world, we see lawsuits against American corporations that trade in “food made from by-products”: McDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Burger King and Wendy’s. These lawsuits have been brought in the name of millions of consumers, people who have been led astray by the methodical and unethical introduction of food products that are harmful to the health and who as a result, suffer from obesity, heart disease and a variety of other serious health problems. Concern is growing everywhere in Europe and the USA over the threat posed to people’s health by diseases found in cattle (such as mad cow disease) and the use of genetically modified animal feed, as well as by genetically modified crops themselves (potatoes and corn) and the use of their components in other products (such as chocolate and candy.)</p><p>
But is it only the food system that’s constructed with profit in mind? What do we see if we look at the way modern governments are built?</p><p>
For example, we have modern democratic society. Just how ideal is it for people’s lives? I was really interested to hear Anastasia’s thoughts on this.</p><p>
“Anastasia, tell me: if someone could construct a food system that would benefit him personally at the expense of a great number of people, then couldn’t someone also think up a social structure that would benefit him personally?”</p><p>
“Of course he could. Judge for yourself, Vladimir: century after century passes, and the names of social organizations change, but the essence of each is the same – the exploitation of people.”</p><p>
“Well, they’re not all totally the same. For example, there used to be a slave-owning system, and now we have democracy. I think there’s a lot less exploitation under democracy than there was when people owned slaves.”</p><p>
“Vladimir, would you like me to show you a picture from the past and tell you a parable?”</p><p>
“Yes, I would.”</p><p>
“Watch, then.”</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0806>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>6. Demon Cracy</p></h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>
The slaves walked slowly, one after the other, and each bore a polished stone. Four columns of slaves, each one and a half kilometers in length, stretched from the stone polishers to the spot where the construction of the fort city had begun. Sentries guarded the columns, with one armed sentry soldier assigned to each ten slaves. At some distance from the walking slaves, on the summit of a thirteen-meter high, man-made mountain of polished stone, sat Cracy, one of the high priests; for four months now, he had been silently observing all that transpired. No one distracted him. No one dared interrupt his reflection with so much as a glance. The slaves and the guards perceived the man-made mountain with the throne at its summit as an integral feature of the landscape. And the person – now sitting motionless on the throne, now strolling across the open area at the summit – attracted no one’s attention. Cracy had set himself a goal: he would reconstruct the government, fortify the priests’ power for a millennium to come, bring all the people of the Earth under their control and turn all of them, including the rulers of governments, into slaves of the priests.</p><p>
</p><p>One day Cracy came down from the mountain, leaving his double behind him on the throne. The priest changed his clothing and removed his wig. Then he ordered the leader of the sentries to shackle him in chains like a simple slave and put him into the column behind a strong, young slave by the name of Nard.</p><p>
Peering into the faces of the slaves, Cracy noticed that this young man’s gaze was not wandering or distant like those of many others, but rather, inquisitive and calculating. Nard’s face was at turns focused and thoughtful, or agitated. “That means he’s conjuring up some kind of plan,” the priest concluded, but he wanted to ascertain how accurate his observation might be.</p><p>
For two days Cracy followed Nard, silently hauling stones, sitting next to him at meals and sleeping in the bunk next to his. On the third night, as soon as the command “Sleep” had been given, Cracy turned to the young slave, and in a whisper full of despair and bitterness, he uttered a question, addressed to no one in particular: “Will it really go on like this for the rest of our lives?”</p><p>
The priest saw the young slave give a start and instantly turn his face toward the priest, his eyes shining. Even in the dim light of the barracks’ lamps, they gleamed.</p><p>
“It won’t go on this way for long. I’m working out a plan. And you can be part of it, too, old man,” the young slave whispered.</p><p>
“What kind of plan?” the priest asked indifferently, sighing.</p><p>
Nard began to explain, heatedly and confidently:</p><p>
“You, old man, and I and all of us – before long we’ll be free men instead of slaves. Count them up, old man: there’s one sentry for each ten slaves. And there’s only one sentry for the fifteen female slaves who do cooking and sewing. If we all attack the sentries at an appointed time, then we’ll conquer them. Even though they’re armed and we’re shackled in chains. It’s ten of us to one of them, and we can use the chains as weapons, too, and use them to defend ourselves from the blows of their swords. We’ll disarm all the sentries, tie them up and take control of their weapons.”</p><p>
“Ah, young man,” said Cracy, sighing once more, and then he apathetically replied:</p><p>
“You haven’t thought your plan through: it’s possible to disarm the sentries guarding us, but the ruler will quickly send new ones, perhaps even an entire army, and they’ll kill the rebellious slaves.”</p><p>
“I’ve thought about that, too, old man. We’ll have to pick a time when the army won’t be around. And that time is coming. We can all see they’re readying the army for a campaign. They’re gathering provisions for a three-month trip. That means that in three months, the army will arrive at its destination and engage in combat. It will be weakened by the battle, but it will emerge victorious and will seize a great number of new slaves. New barracks are already being built for them. We will need to begin disarming the sentries as soon as our ruler’s army enters into battle with the other army. It will take messengers a month to deliver the message that they need to return immediately. It will take the weakened army no less than three months to return. In the space of these four months we’ll be able to ready ourselves to meet them. There will be no fewer of us than there are soldiers in the army. When the captured slaves see what’s happened, they’ll want to side with us. I’ve planned everything out just right, old man.”</p><p>
The priest answered, now in an encouraging tone, “It’s true, young man, with your plan and your thoughts, you can disarm the sentries and gain victory over the army.” And then he added, “But what will the slaves do next, and what will happen to the rulers, the sentries and the soldiers?”</p><p>
“I haven’t given that much thought. One thing has occurred to me so far: all who were once slaves will be non-slaves. All who today are non-slaves will be slaves,” Nard answered somewhat tentatively, as if thinking out loud.</p><p>
“And what about the priests? Tell me, young one, once you attain victory, will you count the priests as slaves or non-slaves?”</p><p>
“The priests? I haven’t given that much thought, either. But what I would suggest at the moment is this: let the priests remain as they are. Slaves and rulers alike listen to them. They may be difficult to understand at times, but I think they’re harmless. Let them go ahead and tell us about the gods, but we ourselves know the best way to live our lives.”</p><p>
“The best way, that’s good,” the priest answered and pretended that he was terribly sleepy.</p><p>
But Cracy did not sleep at all that night. He pondered. “Of course,” thought Cracy, “the easiest thing to do would be to inform the ruler of this plot and seize the young slave. He’s clearly the main source of inspiration for the others. But that wouldn’t solve the problem. The slaves will always have the desire to be free from slavery. New leaders will appear, and new plans will be developed, and since that’s the case, the main threat to the State will always come from inside the State.”</p><p>
A task lay before Cracy: to develop a plan for enslaving the entire world. He understood that it would be impossible to achieve this goal through physical force alone. He would need to exert psychological influence on each person, on entire peoples. He would need to transform people’s thinking and instill in everyone the idea that slavery was, in fact, the greatest good. He’d need to set in motion a self-perpetuating program that would cause entire peoples to feel disoriented spatially, temporally and conceptually. But most importantly, disoriented in terms of their normal perception of reality. Cracy’s thought worked faster and faster, and he no longer felt his body or the heavy shackles on his hands and feet. And suddenly, the program arose, like a flash of lightning. He didn’t yet know the details, and he couldn’t yet explain it, but he could already sense it, and it was astounding in its scale. Cracy felt like the absolute ruler of the world.</p><p>
The priest lay on his bunk, shackled in irons, and he was delighted with himself: “Tomorrow morning when they lead us all out to work, I’ll give a prearranged signal, and the head of security will see to it that I’m taken out of the column of slaves and that my shackles are removed. I will lay out the details of my program, utter but a few words, and the world will begin to change. Unbelievable! Just a few words – and the entire world will submit to me, to my thought. God really did give man a power that has no equal in the Universe – the power of human thought. It creates words and changes the course of history.</p><p>
“An unusually fortuitous situation has come about. The slaves have readied a plan for rebellion. It’s rational, this plan, and it’s clear it could lead to a result that would be positive for them in the short run. But with just a few phrases, I will turn not just them – but the descendants of today’s slaves too, and even all the earth’s rulers, too – into slaves. I’ll force them all to be slaves for thousands of years to come.”</p><p>
In the morning, when Cracy gave the signal, the head of security removed his shackles. And right away, the next day, he invited the remaining priests and the pharaoh to his observation platform. Cracy began his speech to those who had assembled:</p><p>
“No one is to write down or pass on what you are about to hear. No walls surround us, and no one aside from you shall hear my words. I have conceived a way of turning all people living on the Earth into slaves of our pharaoh. This is something that is impossible to achieve even with the help of countless troops and exhausting wars. Yet I shall achieve it with but a few sentences. Once they have been pronounced, only two days will pass, and then you will see how the world will begin to change. Look: down below us, long columns of slaves shackled in chains are carrying one stone each. They’re guarded by a multitude of soldiers. The more slaves there are, the better it is for the government. That’s the way we have always seen it. But the more slaves there are, the more we end up fearing their rebellion. We increase security. We are forced to feed our slaves well, because otherwise they’ll be unable to do this hard physical labor. Even so, they are lazy and inclined to rebellion. Look how slowly they move, but the sentry has grown lazy. He’s not urging them on with the cat o’ nine tails, and he’s not beating even the strong and healthy slaves. But soon they’ll be moving much faster. They will need no guards. The sentries, too, will become slaves. Here is how we can achieve this. Today at sunset, let the heralds issue the pharaoh’s decree, which will declare: “With the dawn of the new day, all slaves will be granted complete freedom. For each stone that he delivers to the city, each free man will receive one gold coin. The coins can be exchanged for food, clothing, shelter, a palace in the city, and for the city itself. From this day forward, you are free men.”</p><p>
When the priests grasped the full import of what Cracy had said, one of them, the oldest among them, uttered these words:</p><p>
“You are a demon, Cracy. Your conception will enshroud a great number of the earth’s peoples in demonism.”</p><p>
“So let it be said that I am a demon. And let it be, that in the future, people will call this conception of mine democracy.”</p><p>
</p><p>At sunset the decree was issued to the slaves. They were astounded, and many were unable to sleep that night, as they contemplated their new and happy life.</p><p>
The next morning the priests and the pharaoh once again ascended to the platform atop the man-made mountain. They could not have imagined the scene they now saw before them. Thousands of people, former slaves, were racing against each other to haul the very same stones as before. Many, the sweat streaming off them, were carrying two stones each. Others, carrying one stone, were running along, kicking up the dust. There were also several sentries hauling stones. These people, who now thought of themselves as free – after all, their chains had been removed – were striving to acquire as many of the coins they were lusting after as possible, so that they could build their happy lives.</p><p>
Cracy spent a few more months on his platform, gazing with satisfaction at what was transpiring below. The changes were immense. Some of the slaves had united into small groups and constructed carts. After loading these carts to the top with stones, they’d push them along, streaming with sweat.</p><p>
“They will invent still more devices,” Cracy thought to himself with satisfaction. “Why, even now, people have begun providing domestic services: they deliver water and food. Some of the slaves eat on the go, not wanting to spend time going back to the barracks to eat, and they pay those who bring them food out of the coins they earn. And look! Healers have appeared, too. They treat those who are ailing on the go, and they, too, receive coins. And they’ve chosen traffic controllers. Soon they’ll choose bosses and judges for themselves. Fine, let them do that. After all, they consider themselves free, but what’s at the core of it hasn’t changed: they’re still hauling stones…”</p><p>
And they have been running this way through the millennia, in the dust, streaming with sweat, hauling stones. And even today these slaves’ descendants continue their senseless running…</p><p>
</p><p>“Anastasia, I imagine you’re talking about regular workers here? I suppose I can agree with that. But you can’t put business managers and bureaucrats and entrepreneurs into the slave category.”</p><p>
“Do you see any difference between them, Vladimir? If you do, then what is it?”</p><p>
“Well, some work and haul stones, like slaves. Others direct the hauling, or to put it in modern terms, they direct the production process.”</p><p>
“But really, directing is also work, and often somewhat more complex than the work slaves do when they haul stones.”</p><p>
“Well, I guess, yes, entrepreneurs have to think a bit more. Their thoughts are occupied by work from morning ‘til night. So, wait, then that means that the pharaoh and the president and the chancellor are also slaves?”</p><p>
“Yes, it does. The priests who committed that ruinous act became slaves, too.”</p><p>
“But if you have slaves, then you have to have slave owners, too. Who are they? If you don’t even count the priests as owners.”</p><p>
“The slave owner is the artificial world created by people. And the sentries – they sit right inside most people, lashing them with cats o’ nine tails and forcing them to earn coins.”</p><p>
“Well, then we’re left with a sad picture, with no way out. Over the past millennia, entire empires have risen and vanished, religions and laws have changed, but in essence, nothing has changed: man’s remained a slave, just the way he was before. Is there really no way we can remedy this situation?”</p><p>
“There is.”</p><p>
“How? And who is capable of doing it?”</p><p>
“An image.”</p><p>
“What do you mean, an image? What kind?”</p><p>
“An image that will present a different scenario for people. Judge for yourself, Vladimir. The people who control today’s world by means of money think that only power and money can bring a person happiness. And they’re managing to convince the majority of people who are striving to earn coins that this is so. But the victors in this senseless race often suffer, very often. They attain some illusory stature and then, all the more keenly than other people, they sense the utter meaninglessness of their lives. I’m going to show you a scene from the future, and you can tell people about it. May it become a reality.”</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0807>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>7. The Billionaire</p></h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>
Billionaire John Heitzman lay dying on the forty-second floor of his office building. That entire floor had been converted into an apartment suite for him. Over the past three years, its two bedrooms, workout room, pool, living room and two offices had become his refuge. Never once in these years had he set foot outside his apartment. Never once had he ridden the express elevator down to any of the offices where the staff of his financial industry empire worked. Never once had he gone up to the roof where his helicopter stood, its crew always at the ready to carry out the boss’s orders, except that for three years, the boss had never once appeared.</p><p>
John Heitzman only ever saw his four closest assistants, whom he would receive three times a week in one of his offices. At these short meetings, which never lasted more than forty minutes, he would hear out their reports without any particular interest, and occasionally he’d give them brief instructions. The billionaire’s directions were never discussed. They were simply carried out, swiftly and precisely. The financial worth of the empire, of which John Heitzman was the sole owner, increased by 16.5 percent yearly. And over the last six months, when Heitzman had stopped holding any meetings whatsoever, the profit had not decreased. There were no interruptions whatsoever in the administrative mechanism he had created and then left to function on its own.</p><p>
No one knew how much the billionaire was really worth. His name was hardly ever mentioned in the press. Heitzman strictly observed the rule, “Never talk about money.”</p><p>
Way back when, the young Heitzman’s father would give him this advice: “Let the politicians flicker across the TV screens and the newspaper pages. Let the presidents and governors talk with the people and give them assurances that their lives will be happy. Let the visible millionaires ride around in luxury cars surrounded by bodyguards. You, Johnny, you don’t need to do all of that. You need to always be behind the scenes, controlling the governments and presidents, the billionaires and the destitute of various countries by means of your power, the power of money. But they should not have any idea who’s controlling them.</p><p>
“This system is exceptionally simple. I created a monetary fund that has many investors on paper. But in reality, it contains seventy percent of my own capital, under various different names. On the outside, to the dim-witted masses, it looks like the fund was created to support developing countries. But in reality, I created it as a mechanism for collecting payments from all countries.</p><p>
“I’ll give you an example. An armed conflict begins between two countries, and one of them – or more likely, both of them – needs money. Let them have it, because they’ll pay it back with interest. Social upheaval occurs in some country, and once again, they need money. Let them have it. They’ll pay it back with interest. Two political forces are fighting for power. One of them will receive money from our agents, and once again – they’ll pay it back with interest. Russia alone pays us three billion dollars every year.”</p><p>
When he was twenty, John Heitzman was particularly fond of spending time with his father. One day this father, who had previously always been strict and unsociable, called John into his office and invited him to make himself comfortable in a chair by the fire. He himself poured John a cup of John’s favorite coffee with cream and asked him, with unfeigned interest:</p><p>
“Do you enjoy studying at the university, John?”</p><p>
“I don’t always find it interesting, Dad. It seems to me that the professors don’t always explain the laws of economics in a very clear or comprehensible way,” John answered honestly.</p><p>
“Good. An accurate observation. But it would be even more accurate to put it this way: today’s academics aren’t capable of explaining the laws of economics because they have no understanding of them. They somehow think that economics is the domain of economists. But that’s not the case. It’s psychologists, philosophers and gamblers who control the world economy.</p><p>
“When I turned twenty, John, my father and your grandfather initiated me into the secrets of management. You’re already twenty, John, and I consider you a worthy vessel for this knowledge.”</p><p>
“Thank you, Father,” John replied.</p><p>
And so, through these fireside chats, John began to study laws of economics, laws different from the ones taught in college. His father used a unique method to teach his son. All instruction was imparted through intimate, kind-hearted discussions that included examples and even playful elements. The information that John’s father laid out before him was unbelievable, and it goes without saying that he couldn’t have acquired it in any university in the world, even the most prestigious.</p><p>
“Tell me, John,” his father asked. “Do you know how many rich people there are in our country? Or in the world?”</p><p>
“They publish their names in business journals and list them in order according to their worth,” John answered quietly.</p><p>
“Do you know what place we occupy in these lists?”</p><p>
This was the first time his father had said “we” instead of “I”. That meant he thought of him, John, as an owner, too. And although he didn’t want to upset his father, John replied:</p><p>
“Your name doesn’t appear on those lists, Father.”</p><p>
“Yes. Correct. It doesn’t. In spite of the fact that our profit from one year alone exceeds the entire worth of many who appear on those lists. And my name isn’t on any list because one should never make one’s wallet transparent. Many people on these lists are working directly or indirectly for our empire – yours and mine, Son.”</p><p>
“Dad, you must be an economic genius. I can’t begin to imagine how you can get such a huge empire as Russia to make tribute payments to us every year without any military intervention at all.”</p><p>
Heitzman Senior took the fireplace tongs, poked the logs and then silently poured a glass of light wine for himself and his son. He took a small sip, and only then did he continue:</p><p>
“It isn’t that I developed some kind of operation. The capital I control only allows me to give orders. Others carry them out. Many analysts, presidents, and geniuses in the governments of various countries would be quite surprised to learn that it’s not their actions that determine the current state of their countries, but my wishes.</p><p>
“The polytechnic centers, economics institutes, think tanks and governmental structures of many countries don’t realize that they work strictly along courses developed by my divisions. And that these courses are few in number. For example, Russia’s entire socio-economic policy and military doctrine are defined and controlled by one division with a staff of four psychologists. Each of the four has four secretaries. None of them knows about what the others are doing.</p><p>
“I’ll show you how we manage to control things. It’s a simple enough process. But first, John, you need to understand the real laws of economics, the ones you’ll never hear about from the academics. They simply have no idea they exist. The law is this: within a democratic society, the presidents, governments, banks, and the large and small business owners of all countries work only for one business owner located at the top of the economic pyramid. They all worked for my father. Now they work for me, and before long they’ll be working only for you.”</p><p>
John Heitzman looked at his father and couldn’t fully take in what he’d said. Certainly, he knew his father was rich. But here he wasn’t talking simply about wealth, but about the super power that he, John, would inherit. He was having a hard time fully comprehending this incredible piece of information. How was it possible that within a free, democratic society, everyone, starting with the president and ending with hundreds of thousands of large and small firms – all of them independent legal entities – were essentially working for one person, his father?</p><p>
“When your grandfather told me what I’ve just told you, I couldn’t immediately comprehend what he’d said, and I imagine you don’t quite get everything, either, John. But understand this,” Heitzman Senior continued. “There are wealthy people in the world. But for every wealthy person, there’s one who’s wealthier. And there’s one who’s the wealthiest of all. All the other wealthy people – and consequently all who work under them, too – work for him, the wealthiest one. Such is the law of the system in which we live.</p><p>
“All the talk about selfless aid to developing countries is nothing but a smokescreen. Certainly, wealthy countries offer credit to developing countries through international funds, but the only real reason they do that is to receive good, solid interest in exchange for the use of those funds – to receive tribute payments.</p><p>
“For example, Russia pays three billion dollars a year to the IMF, and that figure represents only the interest Russian has accumulated on the money it’s borrowed. Many economists know that the main financing for the IMF comes from US capital. They understand that the sky-high interest that countries pay to borrow money goes to the US. But who specifically receives it, no one knows that. The US, as a country, is no more than a convenient front in the game of capital. And the US is the country most dependent on capital. Tell me, John, are you aware that America has a national debt?”</p><p>
“Yes, Dad, I’m aware of that. The debt figure is astronomical. For last year it amounted to… The interest paid on America’s debt amounted to…”</p><p>
“So, do you see that a country that lends money to other countries itself takes on huge amounts of debt? But from whom does it borrow? Do you understand that?”</p><p>
“From its own Federal Reserve?”</p><p>
“But to whom does that belong, this Federal Reserve?”</p><p>
“To…to…”</p><p>
John had never thought about who America owed money to, but as he answered his father’s questions, he understood: in the US, each taxpayer pays into the Federal Reserve. But it…. the Federal Reserve is a private bank. Consequently, all of America pays hundreds of billions of dollars to some private people… or to one private person…</p><p>
His whole life, Heitzman had never been a vain person. He’d led a healthy life, as they say, didn’t drink or smoke, followed healthy diets and worked out every day. It was only in the last six months that he’d stopped going to his workout room. For half a year he’d been lying in bed in one of his spacious bedrooms that was chock full of ultra-modern medical equipment. In the room next door, doctors were on duty twenty-four hours a day, working in shifts. But John Heitzman didn’t trust modern medical science. He saw no need to even talk with the doctors. The only person he would occasionally favor with short answers was a certain psychology professor. Heitzman wasn’t even interested in knowing the doctors’ names, including this professor’s, although he took note that this one was the most sincere and honest of the bunch. The professor talked a lot, but what often came across when he spoke were not only medical assertions, but also his own thoughts, and his desire to find out what was causing Heitzman’s illness.</p><p>
“I was thinking about your condition last night and this morning. I can see it now. I’ll figure out what’s causing your illness and then, once we’ve eliminated the cause, you’ll get well in short order. Oh, excuse me, Mr. Heitzman, I forgot to say hello. Good morning, Mr. Heitzman. I was a little distracted by my own thoughts.”</p><p>
The billionaire didn’t respond to the professor’s greeting and didn’t turn in his direction, but that was how he acted with all the doctors. And sometimes when a doctor came in, Heitzman would give a signal – a slight movement of the wrist – and everyone knew that this signal meant, “Go away.”</p><p>
He didn’t give this signal to the professor, and so the professor excitedly continued sharing his train of thought:</p><p>
“I disagree with my colleagues who say you need liver, kidney and heart transplants. It’s true that these organs aren’t functioning as effectively as they should. Hmm. Yes. Not as effectively as they should be. The cause of this lies in your deep depression. Hmm. Yes, your depression. I’ve read your chart over several times. And I think I’ve made a very important discovery. Your primary care doctor is amazing – he noted down everything in great detail. Every time he examined you, he also made notes about your psychological state. Your internal organs began to fail as soon as you entered a depressed state. Hmm. Yes, a state… Now, here’s the most important question: did the depression arise when your internal organs began to fail, or was it the other way around? Did the depression cause all your body’s organs to fail? I’m certain that’s it! I’m completely certain that the primary cause is the depression. Hmm. Yes. Your deep depression. The state when a person stops striving toward a goal, loses interest in what’s going on around him, when he doesn’t see any point in living. And then the brain begins sending out weak or erratic signals to the entire body. The entire body! The stronger the depression, the weaker the signals, and when the depression reaches a certain level of intensity, the brain can stop sending these signals entirely, and then death ensues.</p><p>
“And so, the primary cause is depression, but how can we eliminate it entirely? Modern medicine doesn’t know how to do that. I’ve looked into folk medicine. And now I’m convinced that the cause of your deep depression is the evil eye. Hmm. Yes. Or to be more precise, someone put the evil eye on you, and I have a lot of facts that can prove it.”</p><p>
The billionaire wanted to give the “Go away” signal with his hand. He had no use for all those esoteric alternative healing practitioners today who promise to remove hexes and the evil eye and provide protection against them. He thought of them as small businessmen or swindlers. It seemed that the professor, sensing that modern medicine was powerless here, had himself migrated to the ranks of these so-called alternative healers. Before the billionaire could give the “Go away” signal, the professor cut him off with words that elicited a bit of interest – faint, but interest all the same.</p><p>
“I sense that you’re about to send me away now. Maybe forever. I ask you. I beg you: give me five or six more minutes. If you understand what I tell you, then it’s possible that you can get well, and I’ll have made a great discovery. Well, actually, I’ve already made it. I just need to confirm it.”</p><p>
The billionaire did not give the “Go away” signal after all.</p><p>
For three seconds, the professor stared without blinking at the hand of the man lying motionlessly before him, and, seeing that he had permission to proceed, quickly began speaking once more:</p><p>
“People look at each other in a variety of ways. With indifference, with love, with hatred, envy, fear, respect. But it isn’t the eyes’ external expression that plays the key role here. The outer expression can be nothing more than a mask, like the false smile of a waiter or a salesperson. What’s important is the true relationship, the true feelings one person has for another. The more positive feelings people direct toward this or that person, the more positive energy concentrates inside him. Conversely, if he’s surrounded predominantly by negative feelings, then it’s the negative and the destructive that build up within him.</p><p>
“The common folk call this ‘the evil eye,’ and this is what healers focus on in their practices. Not all of them are charlatans, not by a long shot. The thing is that a person who’s received too much negative energy from those around him is himself capable of neutralizing it or, in other words, of bringing it back into balance. When a healer tells someone that he’s removing the evil eye by doing certain actions, he’s helping the person believe that he’s been cleansed. If the person believes the healer, then the person himself really does bring the positive and negative into balance inside him. If he doesn’t believe, then this doesn’t happen. You don’t have faith in healers and consequently, they can’t help you. But that doesn’t mean that you don’t have an excess of negative, psychic energy in you, energy that’s harmful to your organism. Why do I say you have an excess of negative energy? Well, because everyone around a person like you can’t help but view you with envy, and not in the positive sense. They also might see you, or more precisely, relate to you with hatred. Those would be the people you’ve fired or haven’t given raises to. Many people, sensing your power, could be fearful of you. So you see, this all is negative energy. And you need positive energy to counterbalance it. You can receive this from your family members and relatives, but your wives betrayed you, and you have no children or friends, and you don’t spend time with your relatives. You have no sources of positive energy. It is possible for a person to produce as much positive energy as he needs on his own. But to do that, he has to have a cherished goal or dream, one that will cause positive emotions to arise as he gradually moves toward it. You’ve achieved a great deal, and it seems that now you no longer have any dreams.</p><p>
“But this is very important – having a goal and moving toward achieving it. I’ve analyzed the physical and psychological states of various types of businessmen. A person who makes some dough, bakes some pies and sells them is happy to have the opportunity to then buy the items he needs, and he dreams of developing his business – because only when it grows can he enjoy many of the prizes of an advanced civilization. A prominent banker or the owner of a profitable firm also strives to develop his business and increase his income, but he’s often less passionate about it than the person who bakes or sells pies. It sounds paradoxical, but it’s a known fact – he’s less passionate. Less, because far fewer appealing prizes lie ahead for him than for the pie seller. For him the majority of civilization’s achievements aren’t prizes, but mundane reality. If someone who’s not particularly wealthy has the chance to buy a car, then buying it gives him a feeling of satisfaction or even delight. But a person who’s relatively wealthy won’t feel happy when he gets the latest car model. For him it’s a trifle. It sounds paradoxical to say that the wealthy have fewer occasions for happiness than those who are less well off, but it’s true. There is one more thing that can bring happiness: conquering one’s competitors. But it seems that you, Mr. Heitzman, have no competitors.</p><p>
“And so, it turns out that you have nothing but negative energies affecting you, and a lot of them. Oh, yes, and I forgot to say, that there is one energy – a strong, unbelievably strong energy – that can vanquish a multitude of negative energies, and it is called ‘the energy of love.’ It’s the energy you feel when you are in love and someone loves you. But unfortunately, you don’t have any woman at all in your life. You don’t seem to be interested in them, and given your age and your current condition, you probably won’t ever be interested in them again.</p><p>
“I have a lot of corroborating facts to back up my conclusion. I’ve compared the statistical data about the life span of wealthy people, prominent politicians and presidents over the past hundred years. The results are pretty convincing. The life span of the powerful people of this world is not so very great compared to that of regular folk, and often it’s even less.</p><p>
“Paradoxical, but facts are facts. Presidents and millionaires who are under the constant care of doctors and have access to the most up-to-date medical technologies and medicines, who have the ability to consume only the highest quality food, get sick and die with the same frequency as everyone else. These facts eloquently attest to the fact that the negative energy surrounding a person is extremely powerful and that even the most modern medical methods are no match for it.</p><p>
“So does that mean there’s no way out of this situation? No, there is a way out. Maybe a small way, maybe only one way, but it does exist. Hmm. Yes. It does exist. Memories! My esteemed John Heitzman, please, make an effort to recall the various stages of your life. The stages that brought you pleasant sensations.</p><p>
“And the most important thing is this: if there were times when you made a solemn promise to someone and didn’t keep it, then try to keep it now, if at all possible. I ask you, for your own sake, for the sake of science: make an effort to recall the good times, even for just a few days. These monitors record the function of many of your organs. They record it every minute. If you start doing what I’m asking you to do, and if the monitors record positive results, then we’ll have the chance to find a path back to health. Hmm. Yes. To find it! I will definitely find it. Or, maybe you will find it. Or maybe the path itself … Life will find it.”</p><p>
The professor stopped talking and looked once more at the hand of the man who lay there motionless. A second later, Heitzman’s characteristic gesture sent the professor on his way.</p><p>
</p><p>Like many people, John Heitzman would sometimes reminisce about the past. To some degree he understood what the professor had been talking about. He could make an effort to find some good moments in his past, and maybe they really would have a positive effect. But the whole problem with this was that the life he’d lived didn’t seem pleasant to him now. It seemed uninteresting, and even pointless.</p><p>
Heitzman recalled how he’d gotten married, on the advice of his father, to the daughter of a billionaire who’d added to their empire’s wealth. The marriage didn’t bring him any satisfaction: his wife turned out to be infertile, and after ten years of married life, she died of a drug overdose. Then he married a famous young model. She played the role of a wife passionately in love with her husband, but after a mere six months of married life, Heitzman’s Security staff presented him with photos of his wife cavorting with her former lover. He didn’t even talk to her about it. He just told Security to arrange it so he’d never have to lay eyes on her again. And so he had no memories of her.</p><p>
</p><p>As he reminisced, Heitzman came to the period when he’d begun working for his father’s empire, and he couldn’t identify a single pleasant moment where he felt like stopping to take in some positive emotions.</p><p>
There was only one pleasant moment: when he proved to his father that they didn’t need to be the sole owner of the monetary fund. The other investors who were contributing their own capital to the fund and who wanted to increase that capital would expend their own mental energy on increasing the overall capital of the fund. And that meant those investors were working for them, for the Heitzmans.</p><p>
His father thought this over for several days, then one day at dinner, this father who was so stingy with his praise, said:</p><p>
“I agree to your proposal regarding the fund, Johnny. It’s correct. Good for you. Give some thought to what other directions we should be heading in. It’s time for you to take the helm.”</p><p>
For several days John Heitzman felt exhilarated. And as a result he was able to make several more decisions that increased the financial empire’s profit. Even so, he didn’t experience any particular joy.</p><p>
The reports noting larger profits than before were devoid of emotion. There was no one left to praise him. His father had died, and the praise of one’s subordinates brings no joy.</p><p>
And so John Heitzman traveled back in his recollections to his childhood. His memory listlessly illuminated the rare moments of contact with his father. More often than not, John’s strict father would reprimand him in the presence of the nannies and tutors assigned to him.</p><p>
Then suddenly something like a wave of warmth flowed through the body of the billionaire who was lying there motionless. His body twitched with a pleasant sensation. A very sharp and clear picture arose in Heitzman’s recollections. A far corner of the garden, surrounded by acacia trees, stood a little house, about two meters high, with one tiny window.</p><p>
A yearning that one can’t entirely understand, the yearning nearly every child possesses: to create his own little home, his own space. This yearning has nothing to do with whether the child has his own separate room in his parents’ house or shares a room with his parents. Nearly every child goes through a period when he begins to build his own little corner of the world with his own two hands. Clearly, a person has a gene that stores some kind of very ancient information, and it says to him, “You need to create your own space, on your own.” And the person, a child, heeding this call that has come to him from the depths of eternity, begins to construct it. And even if it can’t ever compare to today’s mansions, all the same, the person will feel more serene in this spot that he’s made for himself than he will in any mansion.</p><p>
And so, nine-year old John Heitzman, who had two spacious rooms in his family’s country house at his disposal, nonetheless decided to build himself a little house with his own two hands.</p><p>
He built it out of plastic seedling pots. These pots ended up being very suitable for building. They came in a variety of colors. John used blue pots for the walls and then made a striped border that ran all the way around the perimeter out of some yellow ones. He set out the pots one inside the other, and they slipped into the little grooves, fastening themselves together. John laid one of the walls by laying the pots on top of each other on their sides, so the bottoms faced out, and on the inside, it made a whole wall full of shelves. For the roof of his little house John used boards, which he then covered with plastic sheeting and fastened to the boards using a stapler.</p><p>
He spent a whole week building his little house, making use of the three hours allotted to him each day for being out in the fresh air. On the seventh day, as soon as it was time for his walk, Johnny immediately set off for his creation in the far corner of the garden. Pulling aside the acacia branches, he glimpsed the little house he’d built and then stopped in surprise. A little girl was standing next to the entrance to the house and looking inside his creation. The little girl was wearing a light blue skirt that reached below her knees, and a white top with frilled sleeves. Ringlets of chestnut hair fell to her shoulders.</p><p>
At first Johnny felt jealous to see some stranger here by his creation, and he couldn’t help but ask:</p><p>
“What are you doing here?”</p><p>
The little girl turned her beautiful little face in Johnny’s direction and answered:</p><p>
“I’m admiring.”</p><p>
“What?”</p><p>
“This marvelous and smart little house.”</p><p>
“What? What kind?” Johnny asked again, astonished.</p><p>
“Marvelous and smart,” the little girl repeated.</p><p>
“Houses can be marvelous, but I’ve never heard of one being smart. Only people can be smart,” Johnny noted seriously.</p><p>
“Well, of course people can be smart. And when a smart person makes a little house, then the house is smart, too,” the girl objected.</p><p>
“What do you think is so smart about this house?”</p><p>
“That wall inside is very smart. It has a real lot of little shelves. You could put a lot of things you need on those shelves, and toys, too.”</p><p>
Johnny liked the way the little girl thought. Her remarks flattered him, and maybe he liked the little girl, too.</p><p>
“She’s pretty and she’s a smart thinker,” Johnny thought to himself. Then he said out loud, “I built this little house.” Then he immediately asked:</p><p>
“What’s your name?”</p><p>
“I’m Sally. I’m seven years old. I live here in the servants’ house, because my daddy is the gardener here. He knows a lot about plants and is teaching me about them. I know how to grow flowers already, too, and how to graft branches onto trees. So what’s your name and where do you live?”</p><p>
“I live in the country house. My name is Johnny.”</p><p>
“So you’re the owner’s son?”</p><p>
“Yes, his son.”</p><p>
“Come on, Johnny, let’s play in the little house together.”</p><p>
“How should we play?”</p><p>
“We’ll play that we live in the house, just like grownups do. You’ll be the owner, since you’re the owner’s son, and I’ll be your servant, since my father’s one of the servants.”</p><p>
“That won’t work,” Johnny noted. “A servant has to live in the servants’ quarters. Only the husband, the wife and their children can live in the country house.”</p><p>
“Then I’ll be your wife,” Sally blurted out, and then asked, “Can I be your wife for a while, Johnny?”</p><p>
Johnny didn’t answer. He went inside the house, looked around, then turned toward Sally, who was still standing outside the doorway, and answered casually:</p><p>
“Okay, come on in and pretend you’re my wife. We have to think how to set things up inside.”</p><p>
Sally came into the little house, looked into Johnny’s eyes with tenderness and delight and said, almost whispered:</p><p>
“Thank you, Johnny. I’ll try to be a good wife.”</p><p>
Johnny didn’t visit his little house every day. He wasn’t always allowed to play in the garden during walk time. Accompanied by bodyguards, he’d visit a city park, or Disneyland, or go horseback riding.</p><p>
But almost every time he did manage to visit the house, Sally was there, waiting for him. And each time he came, Johnny was interested to see what had changed in the little house. First a throw rug Sally had bought appeared on the floor. Then little curtains on the window opening and over the entrance.</p><p>
Then he noticed a little round child’s table with an empty picture frame, and Sally said:</p><p>
“You come to our house less and less all the time, Johnny. I wait for you, but you don’t come. Why don’t you give me your picture, and I’ll put it in this little frame. I’ll look at your picture, and that way it will be more fun for to wait for you.”</p><p>
When Johnny came to say goodbye to the little house and to Sally, he left his photo there. He and his parents were moving to another country house.</p><p>
</p><p>John Heitzman, multi-billionaire, lay in bed in his suite and smiled as he recalled more and more details about the time he’d spent as a child with the little girl Sally. Only now did he realize that this little girl had loved him. He was her first love, and her love was childish, reckless and unrequited. Maybe he had loved her, too, or maybe he had just liked her. But she had loved him in a way that, most likely, no one else in his whole life ever had, and so now, reminiscing about the little house he’d built in the garden and about his time spent with Sally, even now, pleasant warm feelings arose in him. These feelings warmed his body, and he felt good.</p><p>
He saw Sally only once more after he moved away, eleven years later. But this encounter… Some new feelings stirred throughout his body. John Heitzman even raised himself up a bit in bed. His heart began pumping blood through his veins with ever greater force. That meeting… He’d forgotten about it. He never gave it any thought… But right now he couldn’t think of anything else, and the very thought of it agitated him.</p><p>
He went back to the estate where he’d spent his childhood eleven years later, for only one day. He didn’t have time to stay longer. After lunch he went out into the garden, and somehow it happened that he found himself heading for the far corner of the garden where, as a child, he’d built his little house among the acacias. He pulled aside the branches, stepped into the little glade and stood there, stock still in surprise: the house he’d built eleven years earlier out of plastic pots was still standing, in the very same spot as before. But all around it… Around it were small flowerbeds, and a path covered with sand led to the entrance, and a little bench now stood by the entrance. And flower vines had entwined the little house itself. There wasn’t a bench there before, but now there is, grown-up Johnny noted to himself. He pulled aside the curtain that covered the entrance and, bending over, entered the little house.</p><p>
He immediately sensed that someone had recently been there. The photograph of him as a boy stood on the table, as before. Sally’s childhood toys were neatly arranged on the little shelves. A small bowl on one of the shelves next to the little table held fresh fruit. An inflatable mattress lay on the floor, covered with a bedspread.</p><p>
John stood in the little house for twenty minutes or so, recalling the pleasant sensations from his childhood. He thought, “Why is this happening?” Their family owned a lot of fancy country houses, and they had a castle, but country houses and castles didn’t produce the kind of pleasant feelings that arose here in the little house made of ordinary plastic seedling pots.</p><p>
He saw Sally when he came out of the house. She was standing silently by the entrance, as if she couldn’t bring herself to interrupt John’s flood of memories. John glanced at her, and Sally’s cheeks flushed. She lowered her eyes in embarrassment, in a soft, velvety, voice that was unusually tender and excited, she said:</p><p>
“Hello, Johnny!”</p><p>
He didn’t answer right away. He stood there, admiring the grown-up Sally’s unusually beautiful body. Her light dress, that hugged her figure, fluttered in the breeze. Through the dress he could see the lines of her lithe, young woman’s figure. She was no longer a child.</p><p>
“Hi, Sally,” John said, interrupting the lengthy pause. “So, you’re still keeping things in order around here?”</p><p>
“Yes. After all, I promised. There’s some fruit there. It’s been washed. Have some. It’s for you.”</p><p>
“Ah, yes… For me… Well, okay, let’s go in together, and we’ll have something to eat.”</p><p>
John pulled aside the curtain and let Sally go ahead of him. She went in, squatted down to pick up the bowl and put it on the table next to the framed photo.</p><p>
There were no chairs in the little house, so John took a seat on the rug. Reaching for a bunch of grapes, he brushed against Sally’s shoulder. She turned, their eyes met, and Sally took a quick, deep breath. A button on the dress atop her firm breast came undone when she breathed in sharply. John took Sally by the shoulders and drew her to him. She offered no resistance. Quite the opposite: she pressed herself to him with the entirety of her burning body. And she did not resist when John slowly and carefully laid her down atop the rug, or when he caressed and kissed her lips, and her breast, or when he…</p><p>
Sally was a virgin… Never before had John been intimate with a virgin, nor was he ever again. And now, forty-five years after that last encounter with Sally, John Heitzman suddenly understood, that this was the only time he had ever experienced truly beautiful, mind-blowing intimacy with a woman… Or rather, with a girl whom he made a woman.</p><p>
Afterwards, they fell asleep for a short while. When they awoke, they talked about something. But what? John Heitzman strained his memory. He really wanted to remember at least part of this conversation. And he did.</p><p>
Sally was talking about how wonderful life was. She told him how her father was saving up to buy her a plot of land, and that he might, if there was enough money, build her a little house. Sally herself would do all the landscape design on the plot, would put in a lot of different plants and would live there happily, raising her children.</p><p>
John made a mental note then to help Sally. “Amazing,” he thought to himself back then. “All this girl needs to be happy is some plot of land and a little house. Why, that’s nothing at all! I have to remember to help her get that land, and a house, too.”</p><p>
But John forgot about his desire. Basically, he forgot about Sally. Life infatuated him with its delights. A new yacht and his own jet brought him joy for the first few days. Then for a long time, only the game of high finance infatuated him – infatuated him and added billions to his father’s fortune, the fortune he would subsequently inherit. This infatuation, which agitated his emotions and strained his nerves, lasted for more than twenty years. It dominated everything else. He went through first one marriage and then another as if they were just digressions. His wives left behind no traces of themselves. After forty-five years, playing the financial game no longer brought him any satisfaction, and he began to experience episodes of depression, which grew more and more frequent, ultimately leading to a profound depressive crisis.</p><p>
But right now John Heitzman was not feeling depressed. Reminiscing about Sally had stirred him in a pleasant way. And it had annoyed him, too. “How did that happen? I made a promise to myself to help Sally, the girl who loved me, acquire a plot of land and a house, and then I forgot.” John Heitzman, who was used to keeping his promises, particularly ones he’d made to himself, knew one thing for sure: his annoyance at himself wouldn’t pass until… He pushed the button to call his secretary. When the secretary entered, John Heitzman, who was now sitting on the bed, spoke for the first time in six months, pronouncing the words with difficulty:</p><p>
“A little more than fifty years ago I lived in a country house. I don’t recall the exact address. You’ll find it in the records. There was a gardener who worked at that country house. I don’t recall his last name, but you’ll find it in the accountant’s files. The gardener had a daughter. Her name was Sally. Find out where Sally lives now. I need this information no later than tomorrow morning. If you get the information sooner, deliver it to me immediately, no matter what time it is. Make it happen.”</p><p>
The secretary called at dawn. When the secretary entered the study, John was sitting in a wheelchair by the window, freshly shaven, his hair combed. He was dressed in a dark blue three-piece suit.</p><p>
“Sir, the gardener was let go forty years ago and died not long afterwards. Before he died he managed to buy two hectares of land on an abandoned ranch in the state of Texas. He started to build a house on that land, overexerted himself during construction, and died. His daughter Sally finished building the house and now lives in it. Here is the address. We haven’t been able to get any more information as of yet. But all you need to do is tell us, and we’ll get you all the information you need.”</p><p>
John Heitzman took the slip of paper from the secretary, read it carefully, then neatly folded it up, placed it in his inside jacket pocket, and said:</p><p>
“Have the helicopter ready to take off in thirty minutes. It will need to land five to ten kilometers from the house in Texas. Have a car meet me at the landing spot. Not a luxury car. No security. Just a driver. Make it happen.”</p><p>
</p><p>At three o’clock in the afternoon, John Heitzman, limping and leaning on a cane, made his way along a crushed stone pathway to a small cottage overgrown with greenery. At first he saw her from behind. An elderly woman was standing on a small ladder, washing a window. John Heitzman stopped and began to look at this woman with the beautiful salt and pepper hair. She sensed his gaze and turned in his direction. She peered for a bit at the old man standing on her path, then suddenly hopped off the ladder and began running toward him. She ran with ease. This woman did not look old at all. She stopped about a meter from John Heitzman, and in a soft, excited voice, she said:</p><p>
“Hello Johnny.” She immediately dropped her eyes, covering her flushed cheeks with both her hands.</p><p>
“Hello, Sally,” John Heitzman said, and then fell silent. Or rather, he spoke, but only to himself, not out loud: “How beautiful you are, Sally, and your shining eyes, and the tiny wrinkles next to them are so beautiful, too. You are just as beautiful and kind.” Aloud he said:</p><p>
“I was just passing through, Sally. And I found out, well, that you lived here, so I decided to visit you. And maybe stay the night, if that won’t put you out.”</p><p>
“I’m very happy to see you, Johnny. Of course, do stay the night. I’m here alone for now. Tomorrow they’re bringing my grandchildren to spend a week with me. There are two of them: my granddaughter’s nine years old, and my grandson is already twelve. Come along into the house, Johnny, I’ll give you an infusion to drink. I know just what kind of infusion you need. Come along.”</p><p>
“So, that means you were married, Sally? You have children.”</p><p>
“I still am married, Johnny. We had one son. And now two grandchildren,” Sally replied joyfully. “Why don’t you have a seat at the table in the gazebo, and I’ll bring you your infusion.”</p><p>
John Heitzman took a seat on a plastic lawn chair out on the house’s veranda, and when Sally brought him a large wineglass with some infusion, he asked:</p><p>
“Sally, why did you say you knew just what kind of infusion I needed?”</p><p>
“Well, my father would gather herbs and dry them and then make infusions for your father, and they would help your father. I learned to gather herbs, too. And my dad told me that you have the same hereditary illness as your father, Johnny.”</p><p>
“But how did you know when I’d come to visit?”</p><p>
“I didn’t know, Johnny. You see, I gathered the herbs just in case. So, Johnny, how did your life turn out? What do you do?”</p><p>
“My life’s taken various twists and turns. I’ve done this and that. But I don’t feel like remembering that now. It feels good here with you, Sally. It’s beautiful. You have a lot of flowers, a garden.”</p><p>
“Yes, it feels good here. I like it very much. The only thing is, do you see over there, to the right? They’ve started building something there. It’s going to be a garbage processing plant, and, they want to build some kind of factory there, on the left, too, and they want us to move somewhere else. But your trip must have tired you out. It’s clear you’ve come a long way, Johnny. I see how tired you are. I’ll make a bed up for you by the open window, and you go lie down a have a good rest. Just drink up your infusion first.”</p><p>
John Heitzman had a difficult time getting undressed. He really was tired. His muscles, atrophied from lying motionless for six months, could barely keep him on his feet. It was hard for him to pull the blanket up over himself, but once he had, he went right to sleep. These days, he usually couldn’t get to sleep at all without a sleeping pill. But here, he went right to sleep…</p><p>
He didn’t see the morning at all, because he awoke only at noon. He took a shower and went out onto the veranda. Sally was getting lunch ready in the summer kitchen, and a little boy and girl were helping her.</p><p>
“Good afternoon, Johnny. I can see you slept well. You look like you’ve grown so much younger. Here, meet my grandchildren. This is Emmy, and this young man’s name is George.”</p><p>
“And I’m John Heitzman. Good morning!” he said, extending his hand to the little boy.</p><p>
“Good. Now you’ve gotten acquainted. While Emmy and I make lunch, why don’t you men have a walk around the garden and work up an appetite?” Sally suggested.</p><p>
“I can show you the garden,” George said to Heitzman.</p><p>
The old man and the little boy strolled through the beautiful garden. The boy pointed out various plants and talked non-stop about all their properties. Heitzman was busy thinking his own thoughts. When they reached the end of the garden, the boy announced:</p><p>
“And here, behind this acacia tree, is my mansion. Grandma built it.”</p><p>
Heitzman moved a branch aside and saw… In the small glade beyond the acacia stood his little house. Made of the same plastic seedling pots. Only the roof was made differently. And the curtain covering the entrance was different. Heitzman moved the curtain aside, bent over a bit, and stepped into the little house. Everything was arranged just like before, except that on the table there was a photograph pressed between two sheets of plexiglass. It was a photo of Sally’s grandson. “Just as it should be,” John Heitzman thought. “The house has a different master now, and a different photo, too.” Heitzman picked up the photo and, just to have something to say, said:</p><p>
“You came out well in this picture, Georgie.”</p><p>
“But that’s not a picture of me, Uncle John. That’s a picture of the little boy Grandma was friends with when she was little. He just happens to look like me.”</p><p>
</p><p>A limping John Heitzman was trying to move along the garden path as quickly as he could, leaning on his stick and stumbling as he went.</p><p>
He went up to Sally and, breathing quickly, a bit confused, he asked:</p><p>
“And where is he now? Where is your husband now, Sally? Where is he?”</p><p>
“John, please calm down. It’s not good for you to be so agitated. Please sit down,” Sally said softly. “You, see, John, it just so happened that way back when I was a child, I promised a certain very good little boy that I would be his wife…”</p><p>
“But we were just playing,” John practically shouted, jumping up from his chair. “We were just children playing.”</p><p>
“Be that as it may, let’s just say that I’m still playing. And that I’m pretending you’re my husband,” Sally said, and quietly added, “My husband and my beloved.”</p><p>
“George looks a lot like me when I was a boy. Does that mean you had a baby after that night, Sally? Did you have a baby?”</p><p>
“Yes, I had our son, John. He looks like me. But he has your very strong genes, and our grandson is like a copy of you.”</p><p>
John Heitzman looked back and forth between Sally and the little boy and girl who were setting the table on the veranda, and he couldn’t say another word – his thinking and his feelings were all confused. Then, for some reason he himself didn’t understand, he said, speaking sternly, “I have to leave right away. Goodbye, Sally.”</p><p>
He took two steps down the path, turned around and walked up to Sally, who was standing there silently. John Heitzman, struggling and leaning on his cane, went down on one knee before Sally, took her hand and slowly kissed it.</p><p>
“Sally, I have something very important to do, something I can’t put off. I have to leave right now.”</p><p>
She laid her hand on his head and tousled his hair a bit.</p><p>
“Yes, of course, if you have important things to do, problems to solve, then you need to go. If things get difficult for you, John, then come here to us. Our son owns a small company now – it’s got a lovely name, Lotus – and they do landscape design work. He doesn’t have any special training, but I taught him myself, and he’s come up with some very talented projects, and he can barely keep up with the work. He helps me out with money and comes to visit me every month. I imagine you must be having money problems? And a few health problems, too. Come see us, John. I know how to get you your health back, and we’ll have enough money.”</p><p>
“Thank you, Sally… Thank you… I have to get there in time! I have to…”</p><p>
He walked along the path to the exit, lost in thought about his plan. And Sally watched John’s receding figure and whispered to herself: “Come back, my love!” An hour later, she repeated this phrase once more, as an incantation. She forgot all about her grandchildren, and she didn’t notice the helicopter circling for more than half an hour, up above her plot of land with its little house and beautiful garden.</p><p>
</p><p>John Heitzman’s helicopter hadn’t even landed on the roof of his office building yet, but his closest assistants and secretaries were already waiting in the meeting room, feverishly checking their figures and preparing to report to their boss. They were no longer used to having him present at their meetings. And so now they awaited their boss with a certain degree of trepidation and fright.</p><p>
John Heitzman came in, and everyone stood up. He started speaking before he’d even gotten to his spot at the head of the table:</p><p>
“Take your seats. No reports. Listen carefully, because I’m not going to repeat anything. There’s no time for that. So. There’s a country estate in Texas. Here’s its address. I instruct you to buy up all the land within a hundred mile radius of the estate. Buy up all the industrial complexes located on that land even if you have to pay three times what they’re worth. Those of you who handle real estate transactions can leave and get the operation moving immediately. If need be, put all your agents to work. This operation should take no more than one week.”</p><p>
One of the assistants jumped up and hurriedly headed for the exit.</p><p>
John Heitzman continued:</p><p>
“All of the buildings, factories and plants on those lands are to be demolished within no more than a month’s time, even if you need to bring in hundreds of construction companies to do it. Within a month, the area where they once stood needs to be seeded with grass.</p><p>
John Heitzman addressed the sole remaining assistant in the room:</p><p>
“There’s a small company in Texas with the beautiful name of Lotus. Execute a five-year contract with them. Put them in charge of drawing up plans for a settlement to be located on all the land we acquire surrounding that estate in Texas. Whatever price they ask for, double it. Make it happen.”</p><p>
</p><p>Two weeks later John Heitzman was addressing a crowd of fifteen hundred people. The landscape designers, botanists and agronomists in the audience had made their way to this auditorium through employment agencies. All of them were hoping to get work, especially, since the ad had specified a contract price that was twice what they usually earned.</p><p>
John Heitzman came out onstage and began speaking in his usual categorical and even slightly gruff way:</p><p>
“In accordance with the contracts presented to you, each of you will be allotted irrevocable, lifetime use of a plot of land two hectares in size. You will given several designs of pre-fabricated homes to choose from, and these homes will be built on each plot on the spot you specify, at our company’s expense. Every year for five years, our company will pay out the sum of money specified in the contract to each adult member of the family. Your task is to develop this territory granted to you for lifetime use. To plant gardens and flowerbeds, to dig ponds and lay out paths. To make everything lovely and good. Our company will cover the cost of all saplings and any seeds you request. That’s all I have to say. If there are no questions, those who wish to do so can come sign their contracts.”</p><p>
But complete silence reigned in this audience of fifteen hundred people. Not a single person rose from his seat to approach the little tables where secretaries sat with contracts awaiting signatures. After a minute of complete silence, one elderly man rose from his seat and asked:</p><p>
“Tell me, Sir. This location you’re suggesting we move to, is it lethally contaminated?”</p><p>
“No,” answered one of Heitzman’s assistants. “On the contrary. This location is exceptionally environmentally pure and its land is suitably productive.”</p><p>
“Then tell us, be honest: what kind of experiment are you planning to carry out on people?” asked a young woman, jumping up from her seat. “Many of us have children, and I, for one, have no intention of subjecting my child to who knows what kind of experiment.”</p><p>
The audience began to buzz, and cries of “opportunists,” “inhuman,” and “monsters” began to be heard. People began getting up from their seats, and one by one, they began leaving the auditorium. Heitzman’s assistants tried to offer some explanations, to answer some of people’s questions, but in vain. Heitzman watched hopelessly as people flowed out of the auditorium. He understood, that if they left, that would be the end of his hope. Or even the end of more than that… He so wanted to do something nice for Sally, for his son and his grandchildren. He didn’t want there to be any smokestacks next to Sally’s cozy country house. He wanted there to be gardens blooming and kind neighbors living around her. He’d bought up the land, and on his orders they’d torn the smokestacks down. And they’d sown grass. But the only way the land could improve was if good people came to live on it. But they were leaving. They hadn’t understood. And how could they understand? How could they believe? Stop! Suddenly it dawned on Heitzman: they didn’t believe, because they didn’t know anything! What if he were to tell them the truth… John Heitzman stood up and, quietly, hesitantly at first, began speaking:</p><p>
“People. I understand. I have to explain what’s motivating my company to take these actions. But it’s impossible to explain. Totally impossible. That’s because, I… You see, my motivation…or rather, all of these contracts are very important to me personally. Or, how should I put it…”</p><p>
Heitzman got confused and wasn’t sure how to continue. But the people had stopped. They were standing in the aisles, and in the doorways of the exits. And they were looking intently at Heitzman. They weren’t saying a word, and he wasn’t sure what to say next. Even so, he pulled himself together, and he went on:</p><p>
“When I was a child… when I was a young man… I came to love a certain girl. But back then I didn’t realize I loved her. I married other women. Had a business. This girl and I didn’t see each other for fifty years. I didn’t remember about her. But not long ago I remembered about her. I understood that she was the only person who had ever sincerely loved me. And still loves me. But I didn’t know that then. I didn’t even remember her. And I also understood, that she is the only person I could ever love. I met with this girl. Of course now, she’s already of an age. But to me, she’s the same as she used to be. She loves her garden. She does everything beautifully. And I wanted her to be surrounded by beauty. And good neighbors. It would be better if good, happy neighbors lived nearby. But how could I make that happen? I was a businessman, and I’d accumulated a certain sum of money. So I bought the land and divided it up into plots and thought up these contracts here. And I did this for my beloved. Or maybe, I did it for myself?” John Heitzman pronounced this last phrase as if he were asking himself, and as he went on, he spoke as if he didn’t even see the people before him, as if he was discussing it with himself out loud. “We live for some reason – for what reason? We’re striving for something – for what? I’ll die soon, and what will I leave behind? Nothing but decay. But now I’m determined not to die before I make my project a reality. I will leave behind something eternal. I’ll leave behind a garden for my beloved. I’ll leave behind gardens. At first I just wanted to hire a lot of workers or contract with a big landscape design company. Contract with them to look after the plantings. But then I realized: beauty ends sterile somehow, if it isn’t somebody’s. And so I decided it should be somebody’s. So that’s why I’m giving you plots of land and houses, and all I’m asking for in return is for beauty all around my beloved. You didn’t believe that the terms we’re offering you in the contracts were real…. You didn’t understand what our goal is in offering these contracts. Now you know.”</p><p>
John Heitzman fell silent. The people standing in the room were silent, too. The first one to break the silence was the woman who’d been most vehement in expressing her distrust. First she quickly walked up to the row of tables by the wall, where the contracts were laid out, asked one of the secretaries to enter her name and signed the contract without even reading it. Then she turned to the people in the room and said:</p><p>
“Yes I signed it. I was the first to sign. I’ll go down in history for that. Because I am the first. Just think about it: no man, no matter how rich he might be, has ever given a greater gift to his beloved than that man standing on stage there. There’s no greater gift you could give.”</p><p>
“No one’s ever been able to think up anything greater than that. Not in the entire known history of mankind,” another woman shouted out from the audience.</p><p>
“I love you,” called out a third.</p><p>
“I want a plot next to your beloved. What’s her name?” asked a fourth.</p><p>
“Her name is…” Heitzman began, and then went on: “Well, maybe she doesn’t need to know about this. Let her think that this is just the way the fates decreed.”</p><p>
Moving as one, the people in the room rushed to the tables by the wall. A line formed. People were joking happily and calling each other as nothing less than neighbors, but the great majority of them, especially the women, were directing their gaze, shining with love, at the man standing on the stage.</p><p>
For the first time in his life, John Heitzman personally experienced the energy of kindness, love and sincere delight emanating from a great number of human souls. A healing energy capable of vanquishing everything, any ailments. When he left the stage, he was no longer limping. And during the next several months, he personally took an active part in making sure the factories on the land he’d bought were torn down, personally discussed the details of the plans for the entire settlement around Sally’s estate, personally consulted about the landscaping options for each separate plot as well as the entire infrastructure.</p><p>
When, after a year, he once again walked up to the gate of Sally’s estate, all around, as far as the eye could see, people were already planting large gardens of small saplings, and near Sally’s gate he saw several saplings with carefully wrapped root balls. Sally seemed to have sensed his arrival and ran to meet him.</p><p>
“John, it’s so good you’ve come! So good! Hello, John!”</p><p>
She ran up to him, fast and ardent as a girl. She seized John’s hand and dragged him in to have some tea, all the while happily talking non-stop:</p><p>
“You know, John! What a miraculous thing is going on around here! I’m so happy! Unusually happy. There aren’t going to be any smokestacks near our house any more. And we’ll have nice neighbors. Life is so full to bursting all around! So full! Don’t you worry if things aren’t going well with your business, John. Say the heck with everything and come live here. We’re rich now: our son got a lucrative contract, actually an unusually lucrative contract. Now he’s in charge of the landscape design and planning for the whole project here. And we’ve gotten a little more land, too. Our son’s going to build himself a new house there. And if you want, you and I will live here.”</p><p>
“I do want to,” John Heitzman answered, and added: “Thank you for the invitation, Sally.”</p><p>
“But why are you going to live in an old house?” rang out a voice behind John Heitzman. He turned and saw his son. He knew right away that this was his son. And the young man continued: “So I gather that you’re my father? When Georgie told me how you thought the photo of Mom’s childhood friend was a photo of him, then I figured out who’d come to visit. And besides, Mom’s never been good at hiding her feelings.”</p><p>
“Of course, I don’t feel the same way Mom does about you, not yet, but I’m prepared to finance the construction of a new cottage for my happy parents.”</p><p>
“Thank you, Son,” John Heitzman replied, holding back. He wanted to go embrace his son, but for some reason he hesitated. The young man took the first step. Putting his hand out, he introduced himself: “John.”</p><p>
“This is great! It’s wonderful – now you’ve met. When you get to know each other a little better, then you’ll like each other, but for now let’s go have some tea,” said Sally.</p><p>
And at the table, Sally once again excitedly talked non-stop about all the unusual goings on in recent months.</p><p>
“You can’t imagine, John. Just try to imagine. This story they’re telling around here is like the most beautiful fairy tale in the world. A life fairy tale come to life. Just imagine, John: people are saying that one person bought up all this land around here. Then this person invited the best landscape designers, agronomists and gardeners, and he gave each of them, totally free, several hectares of land that’s theirs to use for as long as they live. He told them to make their plots lovely. And he gave them all the saplings and seeds free of charge, and on top of that, he’s going to pay for all beautification of those plots of theirs for five years. Just imagine, on top of it all, he’s going to pay. This person put every last penny he had into this project.”</p><p>
“Well, maybe not every last penny,” Heitzman objected.</p><p>
“But that’s what people say – every last penny. And do you know why he’s doing all of this?”</p><p>
“Why?” John Heitzman asked calmly.</p><p>
“Now this is the really beautiful part of what’s going on. He did this so that his beloved would be able to live surrounded by all this beauty. They say she also does landscape design. And that she’ll also have an estate somewhere around here. But no one knows where she is and who she is. Can you imagine what will happen when people find out who she is?”</p><p>
“What?”</p><p>
“What do you mean, ‘what?’ Everyone will want to get a good look at her right away and even touch her, as if she were some kind of goddess. Me, personally, I’d like to touch her. She must be a very unusual person. Maybe she looks unusual on the outside, or maybe, she’s unusual inside. ‘Not a single woman in the world could inspire a man to do such an unusual and lovely thing.’ That’s what everyone around here is saying. So, everybody is going to want to see this man and his unusual woman, and touch them, even.”</p><p>
“I imagine they will,” John Heitzman agreed, and then he added: “So what should we do about that, Sally?”</p><p>
“Why we?” Sally asked in amazement.</p><p>
“Because that unusual woman, the one for whose sake everything’s going on around here – is you, Sally.”</p><p>
Sally looked at John without blinking, trying to make sense of what she’d heard. Something sank in, and the teacup fell from her hands, but no one paid any attention to the sound of the breaking cup. John Heitzman turned at the sound of a falling chair and saw that his son had impulsively sprung from his seat. John Junior went up to his father and, speaking in a soft baritone, said excitedly:</p><p>
“Father! Father! Can I hug you?”</p><p>
John Heitzman hugged his son first and heard the beating of his heart. John Junior embraced his father and whispered, elated:</p><p>
“I’ve never heard of anyone declaring his love in such a powerful way, without any words at all, not anywhere in the world. I’m so proud. I admire you, Father!”</p><p>
When father and son turned toward Sally, she was still taking everything in. Suddenly her cheeks flushed, and it was if it smoothed out her wrinkles. Teardrops began flowing from her eyes. Embarrassed at her tears, Sally went right up to John Senior, seized his hand and led him toward the door to the veranda. John Junior watched as his parents, hand in hand, set off along the path leading to the acacia, behind which stood their little childhood house. They walked slowly at first, then suddenly set off running toward the acacia, just like teenagers.</p><p>
</p><p>Ten years later, John Heitzman, who’d grown younger now, was sitting in the club café along with other men from the community. Laughing, he explained to them:</p><p>
“Listen, there’s no way I’m going to run for President. Don’t even try to convince me. And it has nothing to do with my age. You can run a country without being President. You can run a country from your own garden. Look – you’ve shown by your own example how to build a real life, and all of America is turning into a blooming garden now. If it keeps on going like this, maybe we’ll catch up to Russia.”</p><p>
“We will catch up! We will!” Sally asserted, walking in. “But right now, Johnny, let’s please go home. The little one doesn’t want to go to sleep without you.” Then she added, whispering in his ear, “And neither do I.”</p><p>
A pair of young people, John Heitzman and Sally, walked hand in hand along the shady, sweetly scented alley toward their house. In the spring, it always seemed to them that their life was only beginning. The way real life was beginning all across America.</p><p>
</p><p>“Your story has a very beautiful ending,” I said to Anastasia when she’d finished her tale of the future. “And I find all your stories nothing but encouraging. But will something like that actually happen? In reality?”</p><p>
“It will surely happen, Vladimir. This is not a made-up story, but a projection of the future. The names and places in my story are not important. What’s important is the essence, the idea, the dream! And if my tale brought you pleasant feelings, then people will surely project that essence for the future, and a multitude of people will add great meaning and awareness to the projection in the form of their own details.”</p><p>
“How can all of that come true?”</p><p>
“Look, it’s very simple. Did you like the story?”</p><p>
“Me? Yes, I did!”</p><p>
“Do you want it to come true in the future?”</p><p>
“Of course, I want it to.”</p><p>
“So, if you tell people about it, do you think anyone besides you will want to see something like this in reality?”</p><p>
“I think they will.”</p><p>
“So, you see? That means that people who take up the role of being not just observers of history, but participants, will want to see it. And the words will come to life.”</p><p>
“Yes, I think I see. But I feel kind of bad that you painted these beautiful pictures of foreign entrepreneurs, not Russian ones.”</p><p>
“Vladimir, life itself is already painting beautiful, real-life pictures of Russians. Or to put it more accurately, many Russians are in the process of creating Divine eternity. And you yourself can tell people about that.”</p><p>
“Me? Well, I guess so. I really do know a lot of Russian entrepreneurs who’ve gotten themselves not just one hectare of land, but even a few hectares and are building their homesteads there. Like the ones you were talking about. Their stories just aren’t as romantic.”</p><p>
“Great pages must be written about each person who touches the land with mindfulness. That will be a tale without end. Look, here is but one such story. You’ll recognize the names in it.”</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0808>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>8. I Will Give Birth to you, My Angel</p></h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>
Victor Chadov, entrepreneur, awoke at dawn. Beside him on the wide bed, his young lover was sweetly sleeping. The coverlet's thin fabric hugged her sculpted feminine figure.</p><p>
Whenever they’d appear together at a banquet or in a hotel at a fashionable resort, her figure would attract men’s sometimes envious, sometimes lascivious, gazes.</p><p>
Inga – that was the sleeping beauty’s name – Inga also had an enchanting smile and impressed those around her as an intelligent, erudite woman. Victor liked spending time with her, which is why he bought himself a second four-room apartment, outfitted it with ultra-modern furniture, gave Inga the keys, and he’d sometimes spend a night or two with her there, when his intensive business permitted it. He was grateful to this twenty-five year old woman for those magnificent nights and for her company, but he had no plans to marry her. He didn’t feel any particular love for Inga. And he also knew: he was 38, and she was 25. Naturally, a few more years would pass, and this young woman would want a younger lover. And with her looks and her brains, that wouldn’t be difficult. And she’d find herself someone young and even wealthier, and it would all be thanks to him. Because by marrying her, he’d be giving her entree into the circle of influential businessmen.</p><p>
Inga turned toward him, smiling in her sleep, and the coverlet slid, partially revealing her alluring, perfectly formed breast. But Victor Chadov didn’t feel aroused the way he usually did when he glimpsed her half-naked body. He careful pulled the coverlet up over the sleeping Inga. Quietly, so he wouldn’t wake her, he got up and went to the kitchen.</p><p>
He made some coffee and drank it. He lit a cigarette and, as if lost in thought, began pacing back and forth across the spacious eat-in kitchen.</p><p>
That dream! The unusual dream he’d had during the night had disturbed his feelings. Yes, his feelings, not his thoughts. Victor dreamt that he was walking along a shady path, intensely analyzing the feasibility of his latest commercial deal. His bodyguards, whose presence annoyed him and prevented him from concentrating fully, were walking in front of and behind him. The continual noise of cars rushing along on the other side of the park fence also made it hard for him to get his thoughts together. Then suddenly the bodyguards vanished, and the noise of the cars faded. And he heard the singing of birds and saw how beautiful the spring foliage on the trees along the path and the flowering bushes were. He stopped, delighting in the serene feelings that had arisen within him. And he felt better than ever before in his life. And then he caught sight of a little boy running along the path toward him from far away. The sunlight illuminated the boy from behind, creating a halo around him, so it looked as if a little angel was running toward him along the path.</p><p>
In the next instant it dawned on him: running toward him was his little son. The boy was running toward him, working his little arms and legs hard. Victor crouched down and threw his arms open wide in joyful anticipation of an embrace, and his little son threw his little arms open as he ran, too. Then suddenly, once he’d run to within about three meters of Victor, the little one stopped running. The smile faded on the child’s face, and the serious expression in the child’s eyes made Victor’s heart beat more powerfully.</p><p>
“Well, come on, come to me! Come here, I’ll give you a hug, little son.”</p><p>
Smiling sadly, the little one answered:</p><p>
“You won’t be able to do that, Papa.”</p><p>
“Why not?” Victor astonished.</p><p>
“Because…” the little one answered, his voice filled with sadness. “You can’t hug me, Papa, because you can’t hug a son who’s not been born. And you haven’t given birth to me, Papa.”</p><p>
“Well, then you come here and give me a hug, Son. Come here.”</p><p>
“It’s impossible to hug a father who hasn’t given birth to you.”</p><p>
The little one tried his best to smile through his tears, but a single teardrop rolled slowly down his ruddy little cheek. Then the child turned and headed slowly and heavily off along the path, hanging his head.</p><p>
Victor remained kneeling, lacking the strength to move from the spot. The child was leaving. And the inner pleasant and serene feeling was leaving along with him. The roar of the cards began to grow once more, as if from far away. Victor couldn’t move and he couldn’t speak, but with his last ounce of strength, he shouted:</p><p>
“Don’t go! Son, where are you going?”</p><p>
The child turned, and Victor saw a second tear begin to fall.</p><p>
“I’m headed for nowhere, Papa. For an endless nowhere.” The little one cast down his eyes and was quiet, and then he added: “Papa, I’m sad that because I haven’t been born, I can’t help you be reborn through me.”</p><p>
Hanging his head, the little angel receded from him and before long he had disappeared, as if he’d dissolved in the rays of the sun…</p><p>
The dream ended, but the memory of the wonderful, serene sensations remained. They seemed to be urging him to take some kind of action.</p><p>
Victor finished smoking his third cigarette, put it out with a sharp and decisive motion, then went into the bedroom, saying loudly as he went:</p><p>
“Wake up, Inga. Wake up.”</p><p>
“Oh, I’m already awake. I’ve just been lying here. Luxuriating. And wondering where you’d gotten to,” responded the beauty lying there on the bed.</p><p>
“Inga, I want you to have a baby. Could you bear me a son?”</p><p>
Throwing back the sheet, she jumped off the bed. She ran up to him, wrapped her arms around his neck, pressed her beautiful, lithe body to him and whispered passionately:</p><p>
“The nicest, most beautiful way a man can declare his love is to ask a woman to bear his child. Thank you, if you’re not kidding, that is.”</p><p>
“I’m not kidding,” he replied firmly.</p><p>
Slipping on her robe, Inga replied:</p><p>
“Well then, if you’re not kidding, if you’re serious. If so, then this is a spur of the moment decision. You haven’t thought it through. First of all, I want my future child to have a father in his life, but you’re married, my dear, my beloved.”</p><p>
“I’ll get a divorce,” Victor said, even though he’d actually already been divorced for three months. He just hadn’t told Inga about it, for a whole number of reasons.</p><p>
“Get a divorce, and then we’ll talk about a baby. But I’ll tell you right now, Victor. Even if you do get a divorce, that still won’t be the right time to talk about children. First of all, I still need a year to finish grad school. Second, I’m already so sick of school that once I do finish, I’d like to have a year or two to fool around – hang out at resorts, enjoy myself. But a baby… If I have kids, that’ll be the end of that,” Inga argued, half joking, half serious.</p><p>
Victor cut off her objections: “Fine, I was joking. I have to go, I have an important meeting. I’ve already ordered the car. See you later.”</p><p>
He left, but he wasn’t going to a meeting, and he hadn’t ordered any car. Victor walked slowly along the sidewalk, scrutinizing the women hurrying in his direction. He looked at them in a new, unfamiliar way that surprised even him. He was trying to pick out a woman who would be worthy of bearing him a son. A woman he’d want to have a baby with.</p><p>
All the stylish, made-up girls who used to attract him were out of the running right away. He totally rejected all the half-naked ones in mini-skirts or the ones wearing tight clothes showing off their figures.</p><p>
“I know why they do that. I know what’s on their mind. And they’re trying to look smart, too,” he noted to himself. “They’re using a variety of baits to attract the guys, and they’ll see who bites. And they bite, sure they do, just not because they want to have children. A male will take that bait, but a parent won’t. Go ahead, shake your butts, you little fools. But there’s no way I’ll let a wagtail like you bear my son.”</p><p>
Two girls who happened to be coming toward him just then were smoking as they walked, and one was holding an open bottle of beer.</p><p>
“And those two, they’re not at all fit for childbearing. Only an idiot would want to have a baby with them.”</p><p>
Victor also noticed that very few of the women and girls coming his way were totally healthy. Some were stooped over, and judging by some others’ facial expressions, they must have stomach problems. Still others showed clear signs of obesity or anorexia.</p><p>
“No, you can’t have children with women like these,” Victor thought to himself. “Man, I’m sure every single one of these women dreams of having a prince roll up to her in a white Mercedes, but they can’t do the most basic thing for that prince. They can’t give birth to a healthy child, if they’re not so healthy themselves.”</p><p>
Instead of calling his driver, Victor took a trolleybus to his office, and the whole way there he scrutinized the women he saw, trying to identify who from among them might be worthy to bear his son, but in vain.</p><p>
As the day progressed, even as he sat alone in his office during his lunch break, he didn’t stop thinking about the woman who would bear his child.</p><p>
Every once he had the feeling that it was as if he was choosing a women who would give birth to him himself. Finally he came to the conclusion that he wouldn’t be able to find the ideal mother for his son. He’d have to create her. To do that he’d need to find a more or less healthy young woman of good character who was nice looking, or at least not repulsive, and create the right conditions for her to get all possible training and shore up her health at all the best spas. But the key would be to send her to study at the best possible school, where she could receive information about how to prepare for pregnancy and how to go through pregnancy, where she could learn about childbirth and early childhood education.</p><p>
</p><p>At the end of the workday, Victor called Valentina Petrovna into his office. She was the firm’s lawyer and a woman with a wisdom born of rich life experience.</p><p>
He asked her to take a seat and began in a roundabout way.</p><p>
“I have a somewhat unusual question for you, Valentina Petrovna. It’s, well, a personal question, but it’s of the utmost importance to me. A certain relative of mind asked me to find out… Well, you see, she’s planning to get married and wants to have a child. She asked me to find out where in our country there’s a good school where she could learn the best way to carry a child during pregnancy, about childbirth, and about raising him once he’s born. And what does the father need to do?”</p><p>
Valentina Petrovna heard him out attentively, and after a short silence, said:</p><p>
“As you know, Victor Nikolaevich, I have two children, and I’ve always been interested in the literature about childbirth and raising children, but I’ve never even heard of there being any such school, whether here in our country or abroad.”</p><p>
“That’s strange. They teach people everything, but no one touches on this question, this most important question, not in the schools or in post-secondary schools. Why not?”</p><p>
“Yes, it’s strange…” agreed Valentina Petrovna. “Somehow I’ve never given that any thought, but now this state of things seems strange to me. It seems that the Duma does discuss the question of teaching about sexual relations in the schools, but they don’t consider the question of teaching people the right way to bear and raise children.”</p><p>
“So that means every couple is forced to experiment on their own child?”</p><p>
“So it seems. They have to experiment. Of course there are all sorts of classes, where expectant parents learn what to do during labor and how to interact with a newborn, but since there’s no scientific basis for what they teach, it’s practically impossible to determine which classes really do help and which do more harm than good,” Valentina Petrovna answered.</p><p>
“What about you, Valentina Petrovna? Did you take any of those classes?”</p><p>
“I decided to have my younger daughter at home, in the bathtub, with a midwife’s help. A lot of people do that these days. People think it’s more comfortable for the child to come into the world at home, in the presence of his relatives. They say a newborn can sense when people are acting lovingly toward him, and when they’re indifferent, as often happens in maternity wards. It’s like a conveyer belt there, you know.”</p><p>
Victor didn’t feel encouraged by his conversation with Valentina Petrovna. In fact, it had the opposite effect: it depressed him. For two weeks, he spent all his free time outside of work considering the problem of giving birth to children. For two weeks, whenever he was walking through the city, whenever he went to fancy restaurants, bars and theaters, he kept looking at women’s faces, evaluating them. He even took a trip out to the village, but he didn’t find anyone suitable for himself there, either.</p><p>
One day he drove his Jeep with the tinted windows over to the teacher’s college and looked through the window at the girls walking by. After three hours of this, he turned his attention to a young woman who’d come out onto the porch – a brunette with a short, but tight braid, an elegant figure and, it seemed to him, an intelligent face. As she passed by the Jeep on her way to the bus stop, Victor lowered the window and called out to her:</p><p>
“Young lady, excuse me. I’ve been waiting for a friend here, and he hasn’t shown up. Might you be able to show me the best way to get downtown? And then I could drop you off at home, if you’d like.”</p><p>
She took in the Jeep with a glance and answered calmly:</p><p>
“Why ever not? I’ll show you.”</p><p>
When she’d gotten into the back seat and they’d introduced themselves, Lusya pointed to Victor’s pack of cigarettes and said:</p><p>
“Those are good cigarettes. Might I have one?”</p><p>
“Of course, go ahead,” Victor answered, and he was happy to hear his cell phone ring. It was nothing important, but as soon as he’d hung up, Victor made a worried face and informed Lusya, who was greedily taking a drag on the cigarette:</p><p>
“Plans have changed. I have to get right to a business meeting. Please forgive me.”</p><p>
He let smoking Lusya out of the car – he’d decided he wouldn’t let his son be poisoned by smoke.</p><p>
Victor didn’t meet with his lover at all during these two weeks, and he didn’t call her. He’d decided that if she didn’t want to have his baby, if all she wanted to do was enjoy herself and hang out at fashionable resorts, then he didn’t need her.</p><p>
Of course, it was exceedingly pleasant spending time with her – she was beautiful and smart – but now he’d made some serious changes in his life’s plans. “I’ll give her the apartment: after all, this woman has adorned my life for a while,” Victor decided, and he headed for the university where Inga studied, planning to give her his set of keys. On his way, he called her on her cell phone:</p><p>
“Hi, Inga.”</p><p>
“Hi,” a familiar voice answered. “Where are you now?”</p><p>
“I’m just about to your university. Will you be done soon?”</p><p>
“I haven’t been to school for ten days, and it looks like I won’t be going back there in the foreseeable future.”</p><p>
“Did something happen?”</p><p>
“Yes.”</p><p>
“Where are you now?”</p><p>
“At home.”</p><p>
When Victor opened the door with his key and walked into the apartment, Inga was lying on the bed in her robe reading some kind of book. She glanced at Victor:</p><p>
“There’s coffee and sandwiches in the kitchen,” she said without getting up, and then went back to her reading.</p><p>
Victor made his way to the kitchen, took a couple sips of coffee, had a cigarette, and put his keys on the table, then went to the bedroom door and announced to Inga, who was still reading:</p><p>
“I’m leaving, maybe for a long time, or even forever. I’m leaving you the apartment. Goodbye. Be free, be happy.”</p><p>
And he headed for the exit. Inga caught up with him right by the door.</p><p>
“Now hold on, you jerk,” she said, although not maliciously, tugging at Victor’s sleeve. “So you’re leaving. You’ve turned my whole life upside down, and now it’s good-bye?”</p><p>
“How did I turn your life upside down?” Victor asked in amazement. “I had a good time with you, and I don’t think you minded being with me, either. Now you’ll have your own apartment and plenty of outfits. Live your life, enjoy yourself, the way you wanted. Or do you want some money, too?”</p><p>
“You really are a jerk. You really cut me to the quick. ‘An apartment, outfits, enjoy yourself…’”</p><p>
“Whatever. Don’t make a scene. I’ve got important business. Good-bye.”</p><p>
Victor took hold of the doorknob. But Inga held him back yet again, seizing his hand.</p><p>
“No, sweetheart, wait. Please tell me: you asked me to have your baby. Didn’t you?”</p><p>
“Yes. I asked you, and you said no.”</p><p>
“At first I said no. Then I spent two days thinking about it, and I agreed. I quit grad school, gave up smoking, I’ve been exercising every morning, and then I came across these books about life, about children, and I can’t put them down. I’m studying the best way to give birth, and he’s all ‘Good-bye.’ But you’re the only one I can imagine as the father of our…”</p><p>
When he realized what he’d heard, Victor impulsively hugged Inga, repeating over and over in a muffled whisper, “Inga… Inga…” Then he picked her up in his arms and carried her into the bedroom. Carefully, as if she was the greatest treasure, he laid her on the bed and hurried to get undressed. More passionately than ever before, he embraced Inga as she lay on the bed, and began kissing her breasts, her shoulders while trying to remove her robe, but Inga suddenly offered silent resistance and began pushing him away.</p><p>
“Settle down, please. This is not what’s important. To make a long story short: we won’t be having any sex today. Or tomorrow. Or in a month, either,” Inga informed him.</p><p>
“What do you mean, no sex? But didn’t you just agree to have my baby?”</p><p>
“Yes, I did.”</p><p>
“So how are we going to have a baby if we don’t have sex?”</p><p>
“The sex has to be entirely different. Fundamentally different.”</p><p>
“What do you mean?”</p><p>
“Just what I said. Now, tell me, sweetheart, you loving future papa: why do you want your child to come into the world?”</p><p>
“What do you mean?” he asked, sitting down on the bed in disbelief. “Everyone knows why. And there’s only one way to make it happen.”</p><p>
“Yes, that makes sense. But humor me here. Let’s be clear about what you want and which alternative you’re choosing. Do you want your child to be born as a consequence, as a side effect of your – or rather, our – pleasures of the flesh? Or do you want to him to be the fruit of our love, the fruit we consciously wish for?”</p><p>
“I think a child would find it unpleasant to be a side effect.”</p><p>
“So, you want him to be the fruit of our love. But Victor, you’re not in love with me. Of course, you like me, but that’s not love. Not yet.”</p><p>
“Yes, Inga. I like you very much.”</p><p>
“You see? And I like you very much, too, but that’s not love. Not yet. We need to earn each other’s love.”</p><p>
“I imagine you’ve been reading something strange, haven’t you, Inga? Love is a feeling that comes up all on its own, from who knows where. And it vanishes who knows where. You can earn someone’s respect, but their love…”</p><p>
“But that’s exactly what we have to do: earn each other’s love, and our son will help us do that.”</p><p>
“Our son! Do you have a feeling we’re going to have a son?”</p><p>
“Why do you say ‘going to’? He already exists.”</p><p>
“What do you mean he exists?” Victor said, jumping up. “You mean you’re already pregnant? Ah, so you were hiding it from me. And whose is he? How far along are you?”</p><p>
“He’s yours. And I’m not any time along at all.”</p><p>
“So he doesn’t exist yet?”</p><p>
“Oh, he exists.”</p><p>
“Listen, Inga, I don’t understand a word you’re saying. You’re saying some weird things. Can you explain this to me more clearly?”</p><p>
“I’ll try. So, Victor, you wanted to have a child and you began thinking about him. Then I wanted to have a child, too, and I began thinking about him, too. Now, it’s a known fact that human thoughts are matter. And that means that if we imagine our child in our thoughts, then he already exists.”</p><p>
“So where is he right now?”</p><p>
“I don’t know. Maybe in some other dimension we don’t know about. Maybe he’s in some other galaxy in the Universe, running barefoot amongst the stars and looking at the blue Earth where he’ll take material form. Maybe, at this very moment, he’s choosing where he’ll be born and under what conditions, and maybe he wants to let us know that somehow. Don’t you hear him, or feel him asking?”</p><p>
Victor looked at Inga wide-eyed, as if seeing her for the first time. Never before had she discussed anything this way. He couldn’t tell whether she was joking or serious. But the phrase ‘Maybe, at this very moment, he’s choosing where he’ll be born’ made him stop and think.</p><p>
Babies are born in all kinds of places: sometimes they’re born on a plane, or a ship, or in a car. Many are born in maternity wards, and some at home, in bathtubs. They’re born where they end up being born, but where would children want to be born? Take him, Victor. If he’d been able to choose, where would he have wanted to be born? In Russia, or in the best maternity ward in England, say, or in America? But none of these options particularly appealed to him.</p><p>
Inga interrupted Victor’s musings:</p><p>
“I have a clear plan of how we need to jointly prepare for our meeting with our son.”</p><p>
“What kind of plan?”</p><p>
“Listen carefully, Sweetheart.” Inga spoke decisively, more decisively than she ever had before, now sitting in the easy chair, now walking around the room. “The first thing we have to do is to bring our physical condition into perfect order. From now on – we won’t smoke or consume alcohol. We’ll do a body cleanse, beginning with the kidneys and liver, using infusions and fasting. I’ve already chosen a program.</p><p>
“From this moment on we’ll drink only spring water. That’s very important. I’ve already been getting daily deliveries of five-liter bottles of spring water. True, doing it that way is twice as expensive as going to the store, but that’s okay. We can manage it.</p><p>
“We need to do a physical workout every day, so our muscles will grow stronger and our blood will flow through our veins more forcefully. And we also need fresh air and positive emotions, which are harder to come by.”</p><p>
Victor liked Inga’s decisiveness, and without even waiting for her to finish laying out her plan, he announced:</p><p>
“We’ll buy the best workout machines and have the best masseurs come by. I’ll send one of my drivers out every day to pick up the spring water. And I’ll send a different driver out to the forest every day to collect air. He can use a compressor to pump it into tanks under pressure, and then we can let it out in the apartment little by little. The only thing I don’t know is where we can get or buy positive emotions. Maybe we should go to some good resorts, the way people go on honeymoon trips? Yes, definitely like on honeymoons.”</p><p>
Victor’s mood was improving minute by minute. It was improving because Inga had such a decisive and serious and well thought-out approach to having a baby, and also because she wanted to have his baby. And also because it wasn’t some materialistic, flighty woman who would give birth to his future son he’d seen in the dream, but Inga, who was approaching this so seriously and responsibly. And he so wanted to do something really nice for Inga, whom he already considered the mother of his future son! Victor stood up, quickly put on his suit, went up to Inga and solemnly pronounced these words:</p><p>
“Inga, marry me!”</p><p>
“Of course, I’ll marry you,” Inga answered, matching Victor’s tone and fastening her robe. “Our son should have official parents. But there’s no point in us going on a honeymoon cruise to fashionable resorts. That doesn’t fit in with my plan for preparing for the birth of our child.”</p><p>
“Well, what does fit? Where can we get the positive emotions?”</p><p>
“We need to go around to the neighboring villages and find a spot that feels right to us. It should be a spot that will be pleasing to you and to me, and thus, to our son, when he sees it. We’ll buy a hectare of land there and you’ll build a little house, in which we need to conceive our child. I’ll be in that spot for the whole nine months, leaving it for short times, perhaps. We’ll plant a garden of young trees on our land. I’ll give birth to our son not in a maternity ward, but on our family homestead, in the little house.”</p><p>
Victor couldn’t believe that Inga – this striking young woman who used to so love going to fancy nightclubs and popular resorts – was capable of changing her way of life so drastically. On the one hand, he was flattered by Inga’s plans. After all, she was thinking about his child. But on the other hand, wasn’t there something a little abnormal about these plans? He’d heard from one of his friends about some books that talked about an unusual way of preparing for childbirth. His friend told him about how important it was for every family to have its own hectare of land and gave him a book with a green cover entitled “The Family Book.” He hadn’t had time to read it, but he’d heard that there was a very passionate response to these books in society. The people who read them were starting to change the way they lived.</p><p>
Victor’s gaze suddenly fell on a stack of books on the nightstand – books with green covers. He went over and read the name of the series: “The Ringing Cedars of Russia.” And “The Family Book” was among them. Victor realized that Inga had taken all her unusual ideas about preparing for the birth of their child and about the birth itself from these books and was planning to follow them precisely. But he wasn’t so sure: was that a good thing or a bad thing?</p><p>
Inga’s unusual and unquestioning certainty put him on his guard. It was as if some invisible being had transformed her views of life as we know it, her worldview. But had these books transformed Inga for the better, or had they made her a little bit strange? Victor asked himself this question over and over, and he began putting up some resistance:</p><p>
“Inga, I know that you got your ideas from these books. I’ve heard of them. Some people think they’re marvelous, and some people say there’s a lot in them that you can’t prove, that it’s all fairy tales. Maybe you shouldn’t believe everything written in them so blindly? Think about it: why should we get some plot of land, build a little house on it and disfigure ourselves by planting some trees?</p><p>
“With the money I have, we can buy ourselves a good mansion with already landscaped grounds, a pool, and grass, some little paths and a garden, if that’s what you really want.”</p><p>
“Sure, you can buy a lot of things, even simulated love. But I want us to plant our gardens ourselves,” Inga blurted out, agitated for some reason. “All on our own! Because when our son gets bigger, I want to be able to say to him, ‘Do you see that apple tree, Son, and that pear tree and that cherry tree? I planted them myself and watered them, way back when you were just an infant. I did that for you. You were just a little thing, and the trees were just little things, too. Now you’ve grown a bit, and they’ve grown up, too and they’ve started bearing fruit for you. And I’ve strived to make the whole space around your small motherland nice and pretty for you.’”</p><p>
Victor found Inga’s ardent speech was convincing. He liked it. He even began to feel bad that no one in his life could take him to a garden like that and say to him, “Your parents put in this garden and grew it for you.” Yes, of course, Inga was right, but why was she only talking about herself, as if he didn’t even exist? Victor thought. And he asked, in a slightly offended tone:</p><p>
“But Inga, when our son gets a little bigger, why are you only going to talk to him about yourself?”</p><p>
“Well, because you don’t want to put in a garden,” Inga replied calmly.</p><p>
“What does that mean, ‘you don’t want to’? I so want to do it, if it’s necessary for our future.”</p><p>
“All right, so then, if we’re going to do everything together, then I’ll say to our son: your father and I put in this garden for you.”</p><p>
“Exactly right,” Victor replied, calming down.</p><p>
</p><p>For two months, they spent every weekend driving through the countryside outside the city, in search of a spot to build their family homestead. This was a fascinating way to spend their time, and at that moment it seemed to Victor that nothing in life was more important than searching out the one spot in the world that would be pleasing to his soul – and thus, his future son’s, too.</p><p>
And one day they happened to stop on the outskirts of a run-down little village thirty kilometers outside the city.</p><p>
Inga was the first to get out of the car. “This is it,” she said quietly.</p><p>
“I feel something here, too,” replied Victor.</p><p>
Then they came back to this spot again later and spent the whole day there, surveying the territory and talking with local residents. They learned that the soil there wasn’t so very fertile: it had a high water table. But that didn’t put Victor off. Every day he had a stronger and stronger feeling that this land and the little birches growing on it, the sky and the clouds above him – it all felt like his family. His and his future son’s. His and Inga’s grandchildren’s and great-grandchildren’s. And if the land wasn’t fertile, it didn’t matter – he’d make it fertile.</p><p>
It didn’t take long to formalize the purchase of two hectares of land, and within four months a beautiful little log house –just like something out of a fairy tale – already stood on their plot.</p><p>
Inside the little log house was a sauna, a composting toilet, hot and cold running water pumped right from a well they’d dug on their land. On the second floor was a cozy bedroom with a window that looked out on a lake and the forest.</p><p>
Inga designed the interior of the little house and planned all the plantings on their plot, and she and Victor set out cedars, firs and pine trees all along the perimeter of the plot, along with little fruit tree saplings. Every evening, Victor would hurry home to his little house, to his future homestead, where the future mother of his child was bustling about getting the house in order.</p><p>
It wasn’t just that all the women Victor had known before receded into the background. They simply no longer existed for him. Inga’s unconventional approach to bearing a child gave birth to new feelings in him, too. Maybe he didn’t fully understand them yet – they didn’t really feel like ordinary love, but he knew for sure that he’d never be able to leave her, and that only she…</p><p>
That only with her could he build a future. They went to Moscow together to attend classes on home birth. There was one strange thing about Inga that confused him: she categorically refused to be intimate with him, explaining that their child shouldn’t come into the world as a result of desires of the flesh, but as a result of an immeasurably larger and more meaningful human desire.</p><p>
Really, though, the author of these books had gone too far: not as a result of desires of the flesh? Is something like that really possible?</p><p>
But one day, when he was lying in bed next to Inga, having already given up hope of having sex with her, and was just lying there thinking about their future son, he happened to touch Inga’s breast, and she suddenly pressed herself to him and embraced him…</p><p>
In the morning, as Inga still lay sleeping, Victor went to the lake, and he noticed that the world around him was totally different now: unusual and joyful.</p><p>
Never before had he experienced what he’d experienced the night before, not with Inga, not with any other women. It was not ordinary sex. It was an inspired burst of creation. People are born, and people die. But if they go through life without experiencing this, then they’re missing out on what just may be the most important thing in life. But thanks to Inga, he hadn’t missed out on this most important thing. And some new feelings arose in him now – new, even blazing feelings of warmth toward the sole woman in his life – Inga.</p><p>
</p><p>Except for the rare trip to the city, Inga spent the entire nine months of her pregnancy on the homestead. She planned out where she’d put the baby carriage and the crib, and she even made Victor plant a small grassy area where their little son could walk. Her labor began a week before she was due. It looked as if their future son was in a hurry to come into this beautiful earthly space.</p><p>
From the information gleaned in the childbirth classes, Victor knew what a father needed to do to help during labor, but the only truly helpful thing he managed to do was summon a midwife they knew and call the paramedics, just in case. So, Inga ended up having to fill the bathtub with water herself, get a towel ready, and check the water temperature. Victor, meanwhile, just rushed around the room. He remembered that there was something important he should be doing, but for the life of him, he couldn’t remember what it was.</p><p>
Inga, not counting on her husband’s help, climbed into the bathtub on her own. The contractions grew longer, but as she strained, nothing but joyful, triumphant notes rang out in her beautiful voice.</p><p>
Out of everything he’d heard in the classes, Victor finally remembered one thing – he remembered about positive emotions. Glancing at the windowsill, he caught sight of a flower Inga had planted. It was blooming. He grabbed this pot with the flower and ran into the bathroom with it, repeating in excitement:</p><p>
“Look, Inga, your flower bloomed! Your flower bloomed! It bloomed. Just look at it!”</p><p>
He was standing there like that, flower pot in hand, when his son, with his little body, appeared in the tub.</p><p>
The midwife arrived when Inga had already placed this tiny body on its stomach. Seeing Victor standing there holding the flower pot, the midwife quickly asked him:</p><p>
“What are you doing?”</p><p>
“Giving birth to my son,” Victor answered.</p><p>
“Ah, I see…” the midwife replied knowingly. “Well, then, how about if you put your flower pot on the windowsill and bring me…”</p><p>
</p><p>“I have to tell all the guys…” Victor thought, racing all around the little house.</p><p>
True, eternal love arises only when you and your beloved give birth to your long-awaited child.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0809>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>9. A Fine State of Affairs</p></h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>
A fine state of affairs. We go through life without even trying to discover what lies at the heart of our social structure. But in fact, this is one of life’s most important questions. This question had been bothering me for a long time. I wanted Anastasia to look through the documents I’d brought with me that had to do with building homesteads. I also wanted her to take a look at my address to the President of Russia, as well as some pieces of legislation drafted by readers.</p><p>
However, I thought and thought about it and decided not to give them to Anastasia after all: I didn’t want to upset her, especially because, if she was pregnant, then she needed positive emotions, not negative ones.</p><p>
I finally ended up handing the entire bunch of papers I’d brought to Grandfather and asking him to tell me what he thought of them.</p><p>
“Good heavens, Vladimir,” Grandfather said. He took the heavy sheaf of papers from me and remarked, “What, you want me to read all of this?”</p><p>
“Yes, I’d like to hear your opinion of the current situation.”</p><p>
“Why do you need my opinion?”</p><p>
“So I can decide what steps to take next.”</p><p>
“Well, you should decide what steps to take next on your own, without asking anyone else for advice.”</p><p>
“Does that mean you don’t want to read this?”</p><p>
“Well, all right, I’ll read it, but maybe you won’t like what I have to say.”</p><p>
“I’ll be happy to hear it. But what’s the point of reading it? It’s clear you don’t want to.”</p><p>
“What’s the point? So that you don’t end up wasting your time on something worthless.”</p><p>
Grandfather took a seat on the grass beneath the cedar tree, opened the folder and began turning the sheets over, one by one, taking his time. Every once in a while he’d stop and look at this or that page. And sometimes he’d just turn a page over after skimming it quickly. After a little while he said:</p><p>
“Vladimir, I need to give my full attention to looking this over. Why don’t you go have a bit of a stroll while I do that?”</p><p>
I walked about twenty meters away from Grandfather and began pacing back and forth, waiting for him to finish reading these documents and the articles we’d gotten ready for the almanac. I’d like to acquaint you, my esteemed readers, with these texts, too.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>A Conversation with Presidents</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>Esteemed gentlemen, presidents, premiers and chancellors, can you please tell me who actually runs our governments?</p><p>
At first glance, this seems an odd question. Even a schoolchild could answer it: “A country is run by a president, a government, or a parliament.”</p><p>
But that answer only tells us how massively deluded a great many people are, and not only in our country. Both ordinary people and leaders alike are operating under this delusion. We can dispel it if we think about it logically, and we need to dispel it. Those who are born on this earth but aren’t able to recognize that they’ve been deluded will die without having lived their lives, because their so-called life is nothing but an illusion.</p><p>
And so – let’s dispel it! Let’s start by defining what “running a country” means. The key thing – and perhaps the only thing – it means is controlling societal processes and phenomena. And we believe the main person in this process of control is the president.</p><p>
And so, let’s ask:</p><p>
“Mr. President, can you tell us, please: do you control the growth of drug addiction in our country?”</p><p>
“No,” the president will answer. “I don’t control that process.”</p><p>
“How about the rapid growth of prostitution?”</p><p>
“No, I don’t control that.”</p><p>
“What about the growth of corruption and bribery?”</p><p>
“No, I don’t control those things.”</p><p>
“What about dying out of our population?”</p><p>
“Come on! I don’t control that.”</p><p>
We can ask a great many questions to which we’ll get the answer, “No, I don’t control that.” It would be impossible for us to get any other answer, because any other answer would identify our leader as a criminal.</p><p>
And so, it turns out that dramatic, large-scale processes are playing out in society, processes we can’t ignore and that affect every person’s life, but the country’s highest leader and the whole army of bureaucrats who work for him have nothing to do with these processes. If that’s the case, then what do they control?</p><p>
If we look closely, we see that unwittingly, without even realizing it themselves, they are in charge of shielding the country’s true leaders from view, people who, as you know full well, do have something to hide from.</p><p>
By the way, no president, chancellor or premiere can run a country himself, whether theoretically or in practice. He only voices others’ will, which he has adopted as his own, and scientists and psychologists, for example, can corroborate this scientifically.</p><p>
You and I can see how this happens by taking a close look at our own lives.</p><p>
Don’t certain individuals in kindergarten, school, or college affect our lives? If they want to, they can raise us to be communists. Or fascists. Or democrats, the way they’re doing now.</p><p>
And this educational indoctrination stimulates analogous societal processes.</p><p>
Anastasia said, “We need to define reality solely through ourselves.” These are good and accurate words. But if we want to comprehend reality, then we need to think. But our existing way of life doesn’t provide us with time for reflection, and so we end up using the definition of reality that others foist on us.</p><p>
Now, a head of state has far less time for reflection than regular people. Every hour and minute of his day is scheduled, and often he’s not the one doing the scheduling.</p><p>
A survey of past history also shows that it’s impossible for a government to be ruled by a leader everyone can see.</p><p>
We know that it was priests who educated the pharaohs in Ancient Egypt, and so, naturally, they had advance knowledge of many of the pharaoh’s future decisions. But they still continued to advise him, even during his reign. So, in fact, the pharaoh was actually only voicing the will of others.</p><p>
Eastern rulers also had wise men in their courts and would consult with them.</p><p>
Now, neither the Ancient Greek priests, nor the Eastern courts’ wise men, nor the sages in our own Vedic Russian period burdened themselves with government business. Their main task was to analyze and reflect.</p><p>
Since today’s rulers and parliamentarians don’t have this opportunity, they are deprived of the opportunity to effectively affect the processes that play out in society. This lack of time for reflection deprives them of power.</p><p>
A certain deputy of the 3rd Duma whom I know well, a professor and PhD in economics, confirmed this for me. But he did so only after he’d left his post as a deputy and had the time to reflect and analyze.</p><p>
This was also confirmed by a scandalous situation that was picked up by the media: a deputy of the current Duma filed papers with the Constitutional Court, charging that the Deputy Chief of the Presidential Administration had independently advised a group of Duma deputies not to think, but just to do as they were told.</p><p>
Paradoxical as it might seem, this Deputy Chief ended up being, perhaps intuitively, closer to the truth than anyone else. It was both easier for him on an operational level and more effective to simply make decisions himself, than it was to watch a crowd of people who have no opportunity to reflect struggle with these decisions. And the fact that this is the way it is, explains why the parties in the current Duma have no clear, comprehensible program whatsoever to offer the people.</p><p>
The situation in regard to the ideas and program that Anastasia has already voiced has shown even more clearly that those within the existing system are unable to make independent decisions.</p><p>
Many, many people have supported Anastasia’s program, and research has shown that the great majority of these people lead a sober way life, and that they tend toward reflection. Many, many people in various regions of the country are overcoming all obstacles and have begun putting her program into action. But on the government level, we find people who simply cannot comprehend what has happened among the people.</p><p>
And as if that weren’t enough, opposition has also begun, and this very opposition has revealed that foreign forces are influencing Russia and has shown that it is not our own government at all that’s running our country.</p><p>
Of course, this isn’t opposition by some ancient priests who lay out programs for centuries and millennia in the future. It’s simpler and more concrete than that, and it’s the product of the current system of world order, in which Russia has been assigned the role of supplying the West with raw materials and serving as a market for low quality food products.</p><p>
Don’t think of “the West” as the populations of Europe and America. Think of it instead as a group of multinational corporations, including financial corporations concerned with their profits.</p><p>
As we can all see, these corporations have been very actively putting their plans into action in recent decades, and our leaders have, to put it mildly, put up no resistance. Which serves as yet another clear confirmation of the fact that they have no true power.</p><p>
The sole antidote to the destruction of the government and the annihilation of a significant portion of its population is Anastasia’s program.</p><p>
“So then why,” the majority of readers might ask, and with good reason, “do you keep turning to people who have no power and who can’t change a thing?” I’ll tell you why.</p><p>
First. My esteemed readers, I’m turning not just to the government, but first of all to you, in the hope that by working together we’ll be able to comprehend the situation in which we’ve found ourselves. In the hope that you’ll lay out your own views on this situation in your “family books.” Definitely do that! Otherwise, an unenviable future awaits not only us, but our children, too.</p><p>
Second. I remember Anastasia’s question: “Who’s at fault when people don’t accept the truth – those who are presenting it, or those who don’t accept it?” I think it’s my fault that there isn’t enough government support of those who’ve begun building their homesteads. I haven’t been able to present this idea in a language bureaucrats understand. It seems like it’s the same language, the same Russian, but different strata of society use it differently and invest different words with different meanings.</p><p>
So that means I’m not fluent in bureaucratic language.</p><p>
There are people in the Presidential Administration, in the Government and the Duma who are just like you and I. Just like you and I, they have children and wives and grandchildren, and just like all parents, they want a shining future. And if they can come to understand this situation, then they can gain true power and have a substantial effect on positive processes in society. But where and how can we find the words that can put a stop to the vanity of vanities? We have to seek them out! If we don’t, then new politicians will come along, but they, too, will end up in the very same system that hinders their thinking. And so, I appeal to you, my readers. I have a favor to ask of you: let’s look for these words together, words that people in various strata of society will understand.</p><p>
And so, once again, I present my position and address our President and Government:</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>To the President and Government of the Russian Federation</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>I have no doubt that, as the supreme leader of the Russian government, you more than anyone, want our country to prosper. Like any head of state, you would like to gain the recognition of the people and leave a legacy, so that people will remember your presidency as the most shining example of leadership, a presidency that laid the groundwork for the blossoming of the government and the people.</p><p>
Similarly, each and every Russian family, too, wants to make its life and family life worthy of human existence. And every mother who gives birth to a child dreams that he will have a happy future, and she understands that this can be possible only when the entire government strives to move ahead in a comprehensible and reliably benevolent direction.</p><p>
You are striving to point governmental institutions, the government itself, the ministries and regional powers in such a direction. However, in spite of the sincerity of your desires, and in spite of the government’s efforts, corruption, drug addiction, prostitution, juvenile crime and many other negative phenomena still exist in our country.</p><p>
The ecological and demographic situations are growing more complicated. Families are disintegrating. The country’s population decreases every year. Our people are simply dying out.</p><p>
All that you are doing – strengthening the vertical power structure, reorganizing the government apparatus, reforming the army, doubling the economic GNP – is very significant. All indicators throughout the country are on the plus side, and there’s positive forward movement, but people don’t sense this movement. The people in our country – neighbors, coworkers, colleagues, relatives, parents and children – are finding it harder and harder to understand each other, to find sympathetic, kind words, and build their relationships on a foundation of honesty, decency and trust. People’s anxiety about what will happen tomorrow, about what kind of future their children will have is not decreasing. Aren’t these the most important indicators?</p><p>
We’re fighting negative phenomena more actively all the time, but the negative isn’t declining. Why not? Why doesn’t reality correspond to the people’s desires and the President’s aspirations?</p><p>
Isn’t it time for all of us to look truth in the eye and admit that we’re attacking only the effects, and not the causes that gave birth to them? Isn’t it time for you to openly admit that an ideology exists in our country that’s foreign to our society, and to understand that certain specific forces are encouraging many negative tendencies? As a skilled national security officer, you can’t not know this.</p><p>
The people have been deceived by these forces to such an extent that they’ve begun perceiving reality in a distorted way. Here’s one very simple example: advertising. Psychoanalysts and regular people alike know that mass marketing is, pure and simple, an instrument for powerfully influencing a person’s state of mind. By using this instrument, one can force the peoples of many countries to consume food products that are harmful to their health, wear uncomfortable clothing and vote for a given politician. And it would seem that you and the country’s government hold this instrument for exerting colossal influence over the masses in your very hands. Is this the case? Not at all! It has different masters. Any attempts to introduce some kind of order in this sphere will be met with accusations of violations of freedom of speech. But the ones flinging these accusations will those who are actually depriving the people of their freedom of speech. The mass media are, in actual fact, in the hands of the financial magnates.</p><p>
And these magnates are imparting a monstrous lie to entire nations of people, while hiding behind the cynical explanation that it’s advertisers that finance all television programming, all the interesting shows “you so love to watch.” But it isn’t advertisers that finance the work of the television industry at all. They simply hand over to the TV industry a portion of the money they collect from the public when they pad the price of their goods so they can pay for television and radio ads, for the ads on the street and on public transportation. So, in this way, the entire public finances the work of the TV industry when it buys chemical food products and poor-quality consumer goods. It’s the public that finances the third-rate and openly tasteless television shows and series that spread the image of the manic and anxious Neanderthal.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Science of Imagery and, Who Holds the Key to Our Country’s Ideology?</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>Throughout time, governments’ ideologies have been created with the help of instruments that influence society by using images and hidden ancient knowledge of the science of imagery. Some learned men among you might object that no such science exists. It does exist. And its presence has been determined not by the wishes of scientists, but by the person’s very essence. A person is built to think, and thoughts create images.</p><p>
In recent years people have often linked the existence of a science of imagery to Ancient Egypt. There have been examples in history of governments that were able to become free or seize control of entire nations with the help of images created by ancient priests.</p><p>
Special forces in Hitler’s Germany attempted to master this kind of knowledge. The KGB’s Department 13 did, too, in the Soviet period.</p><p>
Today’s Western political consultants, and ours, too, intuitively use elements of this science. This is where the phrases “creating an image,” “image maker,” and “a candidate’s image” come from.</p><p>
For political consultants, it’s not important what a candidate’s inner aspirations are, what kind of person he is, or whether he’s an accomplished expert. With money and the help of mass media, political consultants create an image the public will be sure to like. And in elections, people vote not so much for a person as for an image created by political consultants. It won’t be long before we’ll be voting for rubber Duma deputies and a plastic president.</p><p>
The greatest achievement of political consultants of an immeasurably higher level is the creation of an image of a government or of entire peoples.</p><p>
In the course of mankind’s centuries-long history, there have been many, many examples of governments being run with the help of images. For people today, the most striking and comprehensible example of the work of these high level political consultants, these “modern day priests,” are the events that our country and its peoples went through over the past century.</p><p>
The Soviet Union – one of the most powerful empires in the world – collapsed. But what preceded the creation of the USSR, and the collapse that followed?</p><p>
Before the USSR was formed, an appealing image of a future socialist – and then communist – government was created. Images of landowners and factory owners began to portray them as bloodsuckers feeding on the working people. The Russian Tsar still reigned. The monarchy seemed unshakable. But at the same time, an image was already at work that attracted its own supporters, and they sought out all possible ways to destroy the monarchy and create a new government. In accordance with the new image.</p><p>
The collapse of the USSR, too, was preceded by the creation of an image of the USSR as a totalitarian government, and there was discussion about how it was necessary to create a new, happy, free, democratic government based on the Western model. The State and the government leaders began to be presented as bloodthirsty oppressors of freedom and the people, and the Socialist system as unacceptable, a dead end. The images that film directors, actors and artists had created of communists, images that entire generations were raised on, were set aside. And what did we get in exchange?</p><p>
The resulting vacuum began to be filled with images of thriving businessmen, gangsters, prostitutes and Hollywood beauties. Our young people strive to imitate their habits and morals. Material prosperity is becoming the unquestionable criterion of success. Who gets the money and how – that doesn’t matter. The public was told we had to build a developed democratic government, but meanwhile, no one was saying a word – and still is not – about the insurmountable problems that exist abroad: drug addiction, colossal corruption, ecological deterioration, depression, a falling birth rate, and many others.</p><p>
Women refuse to give birth when they can’t see any future for their children.</p><p>
The people of democratic countries can’t see a bright future ahead, but our modern day priests have to present democracy in its existing form as the sole acceptable system for human society. Why? Because it’s easiest to govern under the conditions of today’s democracy. Easiest to hide behind freedom of speech, freedom of business, and freedom of choice, and to slip the people some gratuitous sex and violence. And this doesn’t happen by chance. It’s done consciously, with intention. Whatever image resonates with you is what you yourself will turn into.</p><p>
These political consultants know full well what’s going to happen next with our entire nation. It’s not complicated to determine who’s behind the cataclysms now taking place in Russia. All you need to do is follow the stream of our precious human and material resources and see where they flow away to each and every time.</p><p>
The huge stream of emigration to the West following the 1917 Revolution carried a sizable amount of capital, historical valuables and traditions out of Russia. But the main thing it carried away was human resources.</p><p>
After the collapse of the Soviet Empire, reforms and the enticing image of prosperous, civilized countries carried away, and continue to carry away, our material and intellectual resources.</p><p>
But the saddest thing is that the contemporary image that’s been constructed for our government has been invoked to destroy the country and the peoples residing in it. We don’t need any military intervention at all for this to happen. A force more significant than material weaponry is at work here – the image. A combination has been constructed that analysts could already describe right now. It’s not at all complex. Let’s try to think it through.</p><p>
What are we building now? Where are we headed? Political consultants say, “We’re building a developed democratic state on the Western model. And so it follows that once we build it, everyone will be rich and happy.” “But,” millions of citizens note, and correctly so, “if developed, and democratic and happy states already exist in the world, then wouldn’t it be simpler just to move there right now?” And millions have left for Germany, Israel, and America, and they continue to leave, thereby supplying these countries with intellectual and material capital. And becoming slaves there. The image is working!</p><p>
So what can those who remain in Russia do?</p><p>
“Build a developed democratic state and get rich,” says the image. But what should a traffic policeman do to build it? Or a salesperson in a store? Or a government bureaucrat? Many people don’t understand. How you can get rich on a salary of three to five thousand rubles isn’t clear, either. But still, many people, people who have come up with a scheme, drive around in expensive cars, build elegant cottages, and visit expensive resorts. Somehow they’ve come up with a scheme…</p><p>
And the entire country is beginning to come up with a scheme. Buyers and sellers, traffic cops and bureaucrats, Army officers and soldiers, teachers and students. But those who know the law of imagery just laugh at these efforts: “Go catch a corrupt cop, then you can set up a Security Agency within a Security Agency.” We’re fighting not the causes, but the effects. The image has done its job. It can penetrate the minds of politicians and generals unhindered, the minds of high-ranking bureaucrats and average people. For it – the image – there are no border crossings or closed office doors. It will entice a Russian girl to leave a distant village for a land across the seas, lure her to a supposedly happy life and force her to engage in prostitution on Cyprus, in Israel or in New York. For the sake of a supposedly happy life, it will force an official to accept bribes, and a millionaire to contract with criminals. It – the image – is an immense energy. But our politicians keep repeating everything, over and over again, reinforcing this image that is fatal for our country: “developed democratic countries,” and “the civilized West.”</p><p>
People are realizing: something bad is happening to our country, and so, Vladimir Vladimirovich, they understand it when you strive to put things in order, but how can you do this? It isn’t enough to just strengthen the vertical power structure. You’ve strengthened the vertical power structure, but by doing so, you’re strengthening not only your power, but also the power of images.</p><p>
Thousands of bureaucrats have gained more power, but since they are operating under the influence of the image, they will act in ways that will please that image, without even realizing it themselves. Ways that will please those who created it. And its creators have already decided that Russia’s fate is pre-determined. Their actions have become unbridled, openly insolent. So as to strengthen their power and support this image that’s fatal for our country, they’ve sent specially trained specialists to Russia. I’m officially asserting that specially trained people are at work within the territory of Russia, people whose tasks include tracking and, if necessary, correcting the government’s ideology. I think that you are also aware of this.</p><p>
Let’s think about why, in recent years, there have been so few positive images in our country’s fiction, films and television programs. Images that can attract and lead people and help them build a beautiful future for their children. We still remember images like that and live according to them, but what about our children?</p><p>
They try to convince us that this is what the majority of people wants: everyone only wants to see Hollywood beauties, plots about gangster turf wars, and news about blood-soaked events. That’s a lie! People don’t want that! We’re told, “Don’t watch it if you don’t want to. You don’t like it? Don’t listen.” You know, freedom of choice. But that’s not exactly the way it is. Or more accurately, it’s not that way at all. In reality, no one has a choice! Not children, not adults, and especially not the elderly. And if you aren’t living life as a rough and cynical and soulless person, then the road to success they’re showing is closed to you. And there is no other road. Isn’t that what it’s like around you? Or around us? This whole bacchanal is being purposefully pushed on us. Special secret selection mechanisms were developed long ago. Any poets, educational innovators, composers or writers who have dared to create positive images of Russia are cruelly persecuted. For them all paths are closed.</p><p>
This is also done by Western intelligence agencies under the guise of a crackdown on cults. We can hear pronouncements like this not only from the mouths of the officers of Russia’s Special Forces, but also from social and political figures.</p><p>
From the highest officials in the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation – from your Administration. For example, Surkov, the Deputy Chief of the Administration announced in an interview with one newspaper:</p><p>
“A secret war is being waged against Russia by groups in America, Europe and in the East which see our country as a potential adversary. They consider that the nearly bloodless collapse of the Soviet Union occurred thanks to them, and they want to build on their success. Their goal is to destroy Russia and to fill its huge expanse of land with a multitude of ineffectual, quasi-governmental establishments.”</p><p>
This kind of assertion is entirely logical, if only because the forces that destroyed the USSR do exist and quite naturally, once they’ve achieved victory at one stage, they won’t rest, but will instead definitely continue their successful offensive.</p><p>
And what’s important here is not to state this fact, but to understand the mechanism through which the destructive influence is exerted.</p><p>
We already know that the USSR collapsed not as a result of an armed invasion, but as a consequence of the ideological reshaping of the population. Ideology is the chief mechanism one can use to destroy or strengthen any government. But any ideology can influence the masses if a well constructed and fine-tuned structure of influence is in place. It does exist, and it is not ours: images other than ours are working through it. But where did ours go? We destroyed it!</p><p>
In the USSR, in addition to ideological institutions and broadcasting centers, the ideological departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Ministry of Culture, and the press, there was a huge network that included palaces and houses of culture, and regional and village clubs.</p><p>
These institutions enabled millions of young citizens to participate in various amateur groups free of charge. In these groups, people gave lectures and held meetings. The accepted ideology of the government was brought to the masses and explained to them.</p><p>
At the beginning of Perestroika when the ideology was replaced, this network of institutions was liquidated, its funding cut.</p><p>
It’s difficult to imagine that if someone driving a car along the highway suddenly learned that he was going in the wrong direction he would, instead of turning around and setting off in the right direction, start dismantling his car. But something just like this is what happened in our country. When people in our society decided (and not without the help of certain forces, of course) that it was heading in the wrong direction, instead of turning around and using the same mechanism that already existed, they simply dismantled it. And what did we get in its place?</p><p>
It was proposed that the key task of the spiritual education of the population, and the younger generation first and foremost, be entrusted to the Russian Orthodox Church. However, more and more evidence all the time indicates that we need to start by educating the majority of the clergy itself.</p><p>
The Russian Orthodox Church, as a spiritual institution, in a catastrophic way, has failed to justify the hopes placed in it. Why? Simply because within the space of just a few years, with the support of the government, it managed to open twenty thousand churches, but centuries and certain specific conditions will needed if it’s to educate twenty thousand deeply spiritual clergy members who would be genuinely capable of comforting and educating people.</p><p>
And not the kind of conditions where the government dispenses privileges and financing, which does nothing but corrupt and attract opportunists and reprobates. This is a losing proposition, both for the pastors who are not spiritually mature, as well as for those who are craftier and closer to the feeding trough. The winning parish is not the one headed up by a deeply spiritual Superior, but the one that manages to get financing.</p><p>
Because really, the process of attracting a reprobate and then raising up his spirituality is an extended one, dragging on for years. And so a village priest is patching his cassock because he doesn’t have the money for a new one, while another priest is driving around in an expensive foreign car.</p><p>
His Holiness Aleksy II, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, has spoken about the greed and love of money that has already struck the clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church. On December 15, 2004, in the Council Hall in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior at the yearly conference of the Eparchial Synod of the City of Moscow, he said the following:</p><p>
“Today we are forced to observe a series of negative phenomena. These include the overall static nature of church life, the lack of a dynamic parish life, low attendance of church services by worshippers, and the lack of interest in religion among the younger generation.”</p><p>
“The ever-growing commercialization of many sides of parish life is an alarming symptom of the dying out of an orthodox consciousness, of the disparagement of church-going, and of spiritual blindness… More and more often, material concerns take precedence, pushing aside and killing off all that is alive and spiritual. It is not rare for places of worship to trade in ‘spiritual services’ like some kind of commercial companies.”</p><p>
“Nothing drives people away from faith like the self-interest of priests and servants of the church. There’s a reason that love of money is described as a vile and deadly passion and as the sole betrayal in relation to God, as a hellish sin.”</p><p>
The Patriarch forbade the taking of payment for carrying out religious sacraments – rites of baptism, marriage, extreme unction and funeral services – and also the trading in “services” of the Church. But will the clergy submit to the prohibition that the highest church hierarch has imposed on them if they have already transgressed something higher – God’s commandments?</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Russian Orthodox Church, but Is It Russian?</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>Furthermore, it’s perhaps Western intelligence agencies that have exerted the strongest pernicious influence on the Russian Orthodox Church. And one could have predicted that, of course, had anyone been tasked with offering predictions. We understand that in our country, ideological reshaping always precedes reforms. Could the departments of Western intelligence agencies responsible for the transformations their bosses needed to see in Russia have ignored such an important institution as the Russian Orthodox Church? Of course not! Otherwise their work would have been unprofessional. What’s more, the conditions for ideological sabotage in Russia have come about in a more than favorable way. Our own Special Forces who were working on internal reorganization, were, to put it mildly, occupied with internal turf wars that are, I think, going on even now.</p><p>
It’s impossible to have a clear idea of all the operations that Western intelligence agencies are carrying out through Russian Orthodox Church structures. But one of them has resonated with society. Millions of Russians, including Church clergy, have felt and continue to feel its pernicious consequences.</p><p>
Here I have in mind the organization that has established itself under the shelter of the RPC and which denounces secular and religious organizations in Russia, thereby producing hostility in them toward the RPC.</p><p>
“Anti-cult forces” acted in the name of the Church and even, as they have indicated, with the blessing of Patriarch Aleksy II. In response to their actions, people who had previously been loyal to the church or had even attended church and had been baptized, simply began ripping their crosses off their necks.</p><p>
Here’s one other trick the “anti-cult forces” used: while exposing the “cults” they had made up, they were, in effect, criticizing and ridiculing the Russian Orthodox Church.</p><p>
And in this way, they dealt the Church a serious blow.</p><p>
Next they decided to control the highest agencies of State power, too.</p><p>
People in various regions of Russia who have wholeheartedly accepted the idea of the beautiful future of Russia presented in my books, reached out to and continue to reach out to their local administrations, asking that their families be allotted plots of land so that they could create family homesteads.</p><p>
What’s amazing is that for the first time, people are asking not for benefits, not for subsidies, but for a small piece of nature in their very own country, where they themselves will create conditions under which to live, and not just survive.</p><p>
You’d think that a spontaneous movement among the people would only be welcomed. And this movement isn’t transitory. The past four years affirm that these people’s desire is well thought out and enduring. The idea is captivating various strata of the population: schoolchildren, scholars and entrepreneurs, teachers, doctors and retirees, soldiers and politicians, artists, poets and writers. You’ll find academics among them, and governors, and wives of the presidents of former Soviet republics.</p><p>
With the help of these people we can solve many socio-economic problems in our country, dramatically change the demographic situation, solve problems of safety of the food supply, employment and national health. But the main thing is to use the powerful strength of the people who, by creating their own space, are strengthening their beloved county and the government that has given them this opportunity.</p><p>
But clearly, someone was not at all pleased by the positive aspirations that have arisen among the Russian people.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Occupiers in Action</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>The executive power structures of the Russian Federation and even municipal entities have been instructed to view the readers of my books as cult followers and terrorists and, consequently, to oppose any of their initiatives, to oppose especially those people who want to build their family homesteads in rural areas.</p><p>
In the mass media journalists are not to report on these initiatives – to the point that they’re being fired. And if they do mention them, they’re to refer to them as “crack pot” initiatives that are summoning everyone to the forests and back into the past.</p><p>
Personnel in cultural institutions are to obstruct events connected to the books and the ideas laid out in them.</p><p>
The messages sent in by readers clearly attest to the fact that within the territory of our country there’s a certain community at work that has its own agents in government and church structures and that is pursuing its own destructive policies.</p><p>
I am not the only one to assert this. Professional analysts who are familiar with the material we’ve collected are also talking about this.</p><p>
There’s even a phrase that’s been coined: “the Anastasia cult.” But what or who do these words refer to? To me as a writer? To my book entitled “Anastasia”? To the heroine of the book, whose name is Anastasia? To the books’ millions of readers? Or to their aspiration to make Anastasia’s idea about a beautiful and prosperous Russia a reality? It turns out that it’s all these people and things all at once.</p><p>
It’s sad to see the way overseas and home grown deacons – who are not Christians at all – who have occupied the Orthodox Church are influencing the officials of the government machine. For them, Christianity is no more than a convenient shield. It’s totally clear from their actions that they are far removed from Christian morals. Their methods are outdated. These very same methods of lies and violence were used to destroy the culture of Ancient Russia and implant an ideology that was foreign to the people. I have written about this in my books. And they immediately began accusing me of paganism. But what does it mean to accuse me of paganism? Pure and simple, it means accusing me of wanting to know the history of my country and the culture of my ancestors.</p><p>
However, there have also been extremely joyful and encouraging developments. More and more often, life has begun putting forth situations where an invisible ray highlights their unseemly acts. And puts them in a comical position, we could say. You can judge for yourselves.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0810>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>10. "The Family Book" and "The Family Chronicle"</p></h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>
In 2002 Dilya publishers published the next book in the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series, entitled “The Family Book,” and in this book Dilya informed its readers: “The idea of ‘The Family Book’ is dear to our publishing house and makes sense to us. While publishing the given book, we decided to quickly set about putting out a ‘Family Book’ where people could record their own personal family chronicle.” Shortly afterwards, in 2003, the publishing house “Russian House” followed Dilya’s lead and put out a book entitled “Family Chronicle,” one of whose authors was Archimandrite Tixon (Shevkunov.)</p><p>
The beginning of the book also featured opening remarks by Russian President Vladimir V. Putin and the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Aleksy II.</p><p>
“The Family Chronicle is not just a story of the lives of a few people or even of an entire people. It is the tale of the history of the entire State. The fate of Russia is the story of a series of successive generations of families.”</p><p>
“We need knowledge of this sort so that each citizen of Russia can identify his roots and his connection to the history of our great Motherland.”</p><p>
President of Russia, V. V. Putin</p><p>
“The atmosphere of the family, of hearth and home, relationships with relatives, memories of one’s ancestors and the upbringing of one’s descendants – all of this is hugely important for strengthening a person morally and thus, for the State. It’s no wonder that people in many nations say that love for the Motherland begins in the family.”</p><p>
Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Aleksy II</p><p>
But Anastasia was the first to voice this idea:</p><p>
“Not many days will pass, and millions of fathers and mothers will begin to create their family book, filling in the pages, writing in their own hand. And there will be a great multitude of them, these family books. And in each one will be truth coming straight from the heart, for their children. There will be no guile in these books. The historical lie will fall before them.”</p><p>
Anastasia</p><p>
We won’t go into details about how and thanks to whom the “Russian House” publishing house followed the “Dilya” publishing house’s lead. What’s important is for the idea itself to be realized. Now we see that the idea is supported by the President of Russia, the Patriarch, and the Chairman of the State Duma, who presented schoolchildren with “The Family Chronicle” on the Day of Knowledge.</p><p>
And so now what are the poor gossipmongers to do? Label the President and the Patriarch and the Chairman of the Duma cult followers, too? And the former President of Ukraine, too, who signed the “Family-Operated Farms” decree, in accordance with which Ukrainians are allotted not one, but two hectares?</p><p>
And Governor Ayatskov, too, who in an NTV interview said of Anastasia-ites that “the future belongs to them,” and who encouraged the officials in his administration to acquire some land and build their family homesteads.</p><p>
And Tuleev, the Governor of the Kemerovsky Region, who set aside lands for a settlement. And Talgat Tajuddin, Grand Mufti of Russia, who, when a reporter from the studio “Cocreation” asked, “How do you feel about the ‘Ringing Cedars of Russia’ book series?” answered:</p><p>
“I love these books. I read them and get a great deal out of them. I feel that when a person reads these books, his faith in God is strengthened. Because faith in God needs to be nourished every day. But to do this, not only our eyes need to be open – the main thing is that the heart needs to be open. The heart is given in order to love, and Vladimir Nikolaevich Megre’s books helps us love God. He brings this truth to people through the words of Anastasia. Perhaps there are some thorny questions for theologians, and perhaps someone will say that this is like a hypothesis, but faith in God, and what’s even greater – love for God – at first collects grain by grain and then becomes boundless. And a person becomes happy, even before he reaches the other world, while he’s still in this world. And the ‘Ringing Cedars of Russia’ books help us do this.”</p><p>
And on the eve of these events, clearly under the pressure of schemes and threats by those very same Anti-Cult forces, one of the Orthodox archbishops (I won’t name him, so as not to draw him into this story) signed a letter in which he threatened to excommunicate anyone who reads and disseminates books in the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series.</p><p>
In this way, the archbishop “excommunicates” the very Patriarch himself, who supported the idea of creating the “Family Chronicles” and who signed his remarks along with the President. Say the Patriarch has never even held my books in his hands. That’s not important, because what’s important about the book is not the paper with letters printed on it, but the ideas laid out in it. One of these ideas has found support on the government level, and I’m certain that others will also be supported soon. But for now…</p><p>
So, perhaps it’s time to turn our attention to the law-enforcement agencies, which is what the so-called “Anti-Cult forces” really are. And to what methods and schemes they use, while so conveniently positioning themselves beneath the vaults of the ROC. It’s clear that they’re certainly not there to pray! Inciting inter-religion disagreements, discrediting the organs of State power – that’s what they’re up to.</p><p>
And it would be stupid even to suggest that a certain group of “Anti-Cult forces” is seriously and personally disturbed by my spiritual evolution. Their actions clearly show that they’re carrying out contract work aimed at preventing any positive transformations whatsoever in Russia. We can see the course of their ideological sabotage very clearly in the following example.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>The Jewish Question</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>In recent times, passions have yet again flared up concerning the Jewish question, just as they have for the past millennium.</p><p>
People have started talking more and more often about the rise in Europe and Russia of extremist mindsets, including those directed against Jews. A congress of Jewish communities held in Europe linked this situation to the growth of the Muslim population in European countries, saying that it is aggressively disposed toward Jews. But a great number of concrete historical examples attest to the fact that it’s possible to provoke aggression. And certain circles are very actively doing this right now. Provocateurs can be found even among Jews themselves.</p><p>
One gets the impression that an order has been given to organize pogroms. Jewish programs are very advantageous to someone, and here I mean financially advantageous, too. Pogroms can’t benefit extremist organizations financially. They’re more likely to bring losses. But the countries to which the financial oligarchy of Jews rushes along with its capital as it flees the pogroms, so that it can legalize its multi-billion dollar income and receive international immunity, will receive a tangible benefit.</p><p>
And for the sake of their own benefit, they’re prepared to expose simple Jews who are living in Russian territory and are guilty of nothing to attack. This kind of thing has already happened more than once in the history of the long-suffering Jewish people.</p><p>
Why are pogroms necessary? The logic is simple. Society’s discontent with oligarchs and financial fat cats is growing. According to data from the Russian State Statistics Committee, roughly 70% of the population thinks that these people should be “dekulakized” and brought to trial. The President, the Government and the Russian Prosecutor’s Office are relying on legal methods to try to investigate the activities of a series of oligarchs. They’ve set a course for the fight against corruption, and for at least the next four years, oligarchs might lose their capital. Given this situation, they are naturally making an effort to leave Russia. But there’s the problem of how to legalize the capital they transfer to the West. The most reliable method is to provoke a pogrom that will make the entire world community to shudder. From then on, everything’s easy. Finding themselves in a Western country when a pogrom occurs, the financial magnates declare themselves political refugees and, naturally, receive political asylum and have their capital legalized, thereby retaining at least partial control of their resources and factories through people they have trusted or used.</p><p>
And here we have to appeal to all Russian residents, and first of all to organizations that consider themselves patriotic. Do not under any circumstances allow yourselves to be provoked, and don’t sink to pogroms of synagogues. You’ll be acting out a scenario composed by someone other than yourselves.</p><p>
One shouldn’t accuse all Jews of scheming and unseemly acts. There are different kinds of people among Jews, just as there are among Belorussians, Ukrainians and Russians. I’ll say the following by way of proof. When I appeared at a readers’ conference in Kazan, attended by people of various nationalities, including many Muslims, I read a chapter from a book by the Jewish writer and poet Efim Kushner, “The Bloodless Revolution.” Before I started reading, I said that this was a Jewish writer living in Israel, but that he was writing about Russian and its future. I read the chapter, and when I finished, the audience broke into thunderous applause.</p><p>
Muslims were applauding a Jewish writer and poet.</p><p>
Why did something like this happen? Why did these supposedly aggressive Muslims sincerely applaud a Jewish writer?</p><p>
Well, it’s because in his book he speaks about Russia’s beautiful future and links this future to the ideas put forth in the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” books. He calls upon Russian authorities to adopt programs based on these ideas.</p><p>
I’ll tell you right away that he is not the only Jew to accept and support Anastasia’s concepts that are put forth in these books.</p><p>
There’s a club in Israel of readers of books about the Siberian Anastasia. The Israelis compose songs in Russian and in Hebrew about the heroes of the books in the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series. All in all, I get the impression that in the final analysis, it’s the Jews who will take the lead in the movement to realize these ideas, and that the peoples of many nations will follow their lead.</p><p>
I, at least, possess information that precisely in Israel, no small amount of resources has already been set aside for building ecologically pure settlements. “Ah, they’re sneaky,” people will say later. “They’re appropriating a Russian idea.”</p><p>
But they’re not appropriating anything. They’re saving it. So perhaps you’d be so kind as to tell me who it is that’s keeping Russian authorities from realizing the ideas put forth in the books? Because they are the ones to whom Russians living in the former Soviet states and beyond have already been appealing for five years now and continue to appeal with both collective and individual letters.</p><p>
And you end up with an absurd situation. A series of analysts confirms that the national idea has arisen among the Russian people. But because of the situation that’s developed, this idea has to be realized first of all in Israel. Whose fault is that?</p><p>
In general, discussions of the Jewish question are fairly primitive, at least the ones I’ve had opportunity to read on this topic in the press. You can reduce nearly all of them to ordinary statements of facts: “Jews have seized the press of various countries”; “the television industry is completely Jewish”; “Jews control the majority of financial streams.”</p><p>
It’s doubtless that all of this is the case, in today’s Russia, too. But this is just a statement of fact, and nothing more. It’s much more interesting to figure out why situations like this have come about in various countries with enviable regularity, over the course of many centuries.</p><p>
I’ll say the following right away. Jews are simply obliged to do this, and we are obliged to submit to them, and on the level of legislation, too.</p><p>
You can judge for yourself. The State Duma of the Russian Federation has adopted a law stating that there are four principle religions in our country. Two of them are Christianity and Judaism.</p><p>
It follows from the Christian religious conception that a Christian is God’s servant. Wealth is not welcomed. In Saint Petersburg, looking out the window of the hotel where I sit writing these words, I can see the huge Orthodox cathedral of the Vladimir Mother of God, on whose façade the following words are written in large gold letters: “Our Lady, accept the prayers of your servant.”</p><p>
It follows from the Jewish conception that a Jew is God’s chosen one. To him belong wealth and lands, and money lending is welcomed.</p><p>
Everyone knows what a great effect religions have on the psyche, the formation of personality and a person’s way of life.</p><p>
And so we’ll be logically consistent in our actions. The highest legislative branch of our government accepted these two conceptions and in doing so, they’ve designated who should be the servant and who the ruler.</p><p>
And let’s not make trouble for each other if we, as law-abiding citizens act in accordance with the law our rulers have adopted and accept the Jew’s power over us as due.</p><p>
Some people might not be pleased by this situation. Someone might consider my assertions absurd. But let’s not close our eyes to the reality of life. We need to see the reasons for this phenomenon, instead of delighting in the consequences with idiotic persistence.</p><p>
If someone doesn’t like the situation that’s developed, then let’s try to find a way out of it, together.</p><p>
A way out could be an idea that’s embraced with equal enthusiasm by Muslims, Christians, Jews and representatives of other religious denominations.</p><p>
Such an idea exists. And it will correct both this situation and the future that follows it, too. Concrete facts and real-life situations attest to this.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Let’s Create</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>In his Address to the Federal Assembly, the President of the Russian Federation set the goal of doubling the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) within ten years. Well, fine, if there’s a goal, it’s like any other a goal. And one has to take steps to realize it. And first of all to rouse the people. Because that’s who will have to work in such a way that the GDP indicators will double. But what happened after the highest official of the current government set this goal?</p><p>
Unbelievable events began to occur.</p><p>
Instead of even attempting to reach the goal that had been set, certain highly placed officials began saying that achieving it wasn’t realistic, while others said it nonetheless needed to be achieved. And that was it! Nothing more. Time was spent on these conversations: in the end, 2004 ended on a sad note: the GDP had grown by only 6.4%.</p><p>
From the moment the goal was set, the press was constantly talking about it with the very interesting subtext of “it’s doable-it’s not doable”, and again, no attempt at all was made to achieve it.</p><p>
And this situation shows that a complete collapse of the government in Russia is approaching. You can go ahead and choose officials, and you can appoint them, but for various reasons, the orders will not be carried out.</p><p>
Imagine this situation: the Commander in Chief issues the order to “prepare for attack,” and instead of working out an attack plan, his aides – the generals and colonels – begin discussing “is it doable or not.” As a result, defeat is unavoidable. Which is just what happened.</p><p>
Well, perhaps the goal the President set really was crazy? We can’t judge this until we make an attempt to make sense of it. But, at the risk of jumping ahead, I’ll say: it is doable!</p><p>
I can foresee my readers’ bewilderment: what do the Russian Orthodox Church, “Anti-Cult forces,” Western intelligence forces and the goal of doubling the GDP set by the President have to do with any of this? Hold on. The connection here is extremely close.</p><p>
Let’s think: who does the doubling of the GDP benefit? Of course, Russia. Whom does it not benefit? Of course, the West, which regards Russia as just a market for its not always high quality products.</p><p>
And as always, Western intelligence agencies have ended up on the top of the heap, after “smacking down” Russia’s President and officials. After making laughing stocks of them in the arena of setting goals. But let’s look at things in order.</p><p>
In order to double the GDP overall, it was necessary to define the sectors of the national economy and identify those in which a significant increase in production output was necessary and those in which an increase was undesirable. For example, you shouldn’t double the production of alcohol and tobacco products: as it is, Russia is drowning in vodka and choking on tobacco smoke. You shouldn’t double the production of weapons, build new casinos and double the amount of raw material resources flowing out of the country.</p><p>
And if this is the case, then the remaining sectors of the national economy face the task not of doubling, but tripling and quadrupling. These sectors haven’t been defined and consequently, the goals for them haven’t even been.</p><p>
But why set goals, someone might think, if people are arguing about whether it can be doubled, and here we’re talking about quadrupling? It’s impossible to quadruple it.</p><p>
But I say that it is possible! It’s possible even without investing any additional capital.</p><p>
For example, let’s take agriculture, whose production is decreasing every year, which is already threatening our national security. Prominent politicians, Duma deputies and certain government officials are talking about this.</p><p>
And rightly so: today our country imports up to 40% of certain types of food products from abroad. Such a situation threatens national security. So what can we expect? Here’s what.</p><p>
It’s expected that by 2005, the rural population will decrease by 25%, which will exacerbate the problem even more. Or to be more precise, it will make the country entirely dependent. When the Government will have to trade not only natural resources for food products, but rockets, too, because otherwise the population will tear it to pieces.</p><p>
This means we have to change the situation in the agricultural industrial complex and double or triple the amount of produce it puts out. However, the method for tripling can’t be achieved by following the standard path, whereby all propositions basically lead only to the need for additional subsidies. It’s unclear who they’re planning to send these subsidies to, if the labor pool among the rural population is becoming smaller and smaller. And if this is the case, then no amount of new technologies or super-technology will be able to help any more. There simply won’t be anyone to work them.</p><p>
This means that we’ve defined our immediate task: we need able-bodied workers to emerge out in the country. Millions of people. Tens of millions. And we also need them to want to lovingly commune with the land. And if they don’t emerge, then there’s no sense in talking about all the rest of it.</p><p>
However, for many officials, the emergence of these people seems an event akin to a miracle. They don’t believe in it and didn’t believe in it, even when it occurred.</p><p>
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a miracle has occurred!</p><p>
And thanks to just one person – the Siberian hermit Anastasia.</p><p>
Maybe her words seem improbable and fantastic to some. Fine. But they’re effective. They’ve given birth to an enduring impulse in people’s hearts and souls.</p><p>
Tens of thousands of people in various regions of the country had the desire to build their lives out in rural areas. To construct their homesteads there and make them their permanent residences. The number of these people is growing with every year.</p><p>
They are creating their own regional civic organizations and are making a request: GIVE US LAND! We’re prepared to build it up.</p><p>
</p><p>These people have united together into a nationwide civic organization that was established on June 5, 2004 at a conference that took place in the city of Vladimir.</p><p>
This conference showed that for the first time in a post-Soviet space, a people’s force has appeared, a force that at present has no equal. There weren’t enough seats in the auditorium, since a great many people attended who weren’t delegates, but who wanted to listen and be connected to what was happening.</p><p>
The conference decided to establish, and did establish, a popular movement called “The Ringing Cedars of Russia,” whose main objective was set as supporting the idea of family homesteads. A popular movement that does not oppose either the government or political parties. On the contrary, it welcomes communication with everyone and says, “Let’s create.”</p><p>
A popular movement has arisen that possesses a well defined and clear program that is both comprehensible to and supported by the people.</p><p>
What can the Russian Government expect to receive if even just one point of this program is realized? One point that looks very simple on the outside and speaks about one hectare of land, but will ultimately bring about:</p><p>
a significant improvement of the ecological situation;</p><p>
the restoration of soil fertility;</p><p>
a solution to the question of how to provide the country’s population with high quality produce;</p><p>
a significant increase – on the order of two to three times – in salary in all spheres of the national economy without inflation;</p><p>
an instantaneous change for the better in the demographic situation. Increased health and rejuvenation of the population;</p><p>
a solution to the question of the country’s ability to defend itself;</p><p>
an end to the outflow of capital from the country and the opposite, an influx of capital into Russia; the return of intellectual resources;</p><p>
a significant reduction and, in the near future, eradication of bribery, corruption, racketeering and terrorism;</p><p>
the unification of all the countries of the former Soviet Union and the former Warsaw Pact: Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and all the Baltic states into one powerful union;</p><p>
the termination of the arms race and establishment of close collaboration between Russia, the USA and Eastern Islamic states.</p><p>
</p><p>I am not the only one who has drawn these conclusions. Students have asserted them in their senior theses (an example is the thesis of the future lawyer Tatiana Borodina.) Scholars have mentioned them in their works (for example, Doctor of Economic Sciences and three-term Deputy of the Legislature, Professor Victor Yakovlevich Medikov.)</p><p>
</p><p>Professional researchers and regular people write of them in self-published brochures.</p><p>
And I will try to briefly lay out substantiating information for several of the points.</p><p>
</p><p>And so, let’s assume that the country has set about realizing the program put forth by Anastasia.</p><p>
Each family who wants one is allotted, free of charge, for lifetime use, 1 hectare of land with the right of inheritance, for constructing a family homestead on it. The produce produced on the homestead, just like the land itself, is not subject to any taxes.</p><p>
The result of this will be as follows.</p><p>
</p><p>A significant improvement in the ecological situation.</p><p>
</p><p>As practice has shown, when people receive land to use for family homestead, what they begin to do first is set out wild trees, up to 200 per family, on average. Shrubs, living, green fences, berry bushes – up to 2000 on average, fruit trees – 50 on average.</p><p>
Analysts are of the opinion that if the given program is adopted at the government level and properly presented, then at the beginning stages, there will be around 10 million families in Russia – this represents the most conservative calculations – who want to build family homesteads.</p><p>
And that means that within a year or two after the program is adopted, 2 billion wild trees, 20 billion shrubs, and 500 million fruit trees will be planted in the country without any supplemental subsidies whatsoever. And this is only the beginning of the process.</p><p>
</p><p>The restoration of soil fertility.</p><p>
As we know from practice, when people acquire land not on a short-term lease, but for lifetime use, the first thing they do is immediately strive to restore the soil. And they do so not only with the help of organic fertilizers, but by using a more natural method, too – in the first few years, they sow soil-building plants.</p><p>
A solution to the question of how to provide the country’s population with high quality produce.</p><p>
Recall “the battle for the harvest” in the Soviet period. Recall how students, schoolchildren and factory workers would be taken out to collective and state farms to gather the harvest. I, too, participated in this kind of mass event: I weeded and dug onions on a state farm outside of town.</p><p>
However, no surplus of quality produce was seen in the country. The older generation, it goes without saying, remembers the half-rotten potatoes that were sold in the stores and the unpresentable vegetables.</p><p>
Then the dacha movement began. They began giving people six sotkas (ares) of land. And a miracle occurred. Everyone knows the statistics. The country’s population on its own, without any ministries, government departments or agencies at all, provided 80% of the vegetables produced. (Unfortunately, now they’ve begun making things complicated for the dachniki, with hikes in public transportation ticket prices, taxes on plots of land and higher prices for electricity.) And all of that on six sotkas (ares), where it’s impossible to create any kind of ideal economic situation, plant tall-growing trees that enrich the soil, or set up a reservoir. And this while working, for the most part, on weekend and holidays. And without sufficient experience and knowledge.</p><p>
A hectare makes it possible to create a more perfect economic situation. If it’s organized correctly, the labor expenditure for an area one square meter in size goes down by about thirty times. Not immediately, of course, and I repeat: if it’s started up correctly. So we can see that both existing experience and theoretical calculations confirm that realizing the proposed program will fully provide the country with absolutely all the produce it needs.</p><p>
And now about its quality. Need we mention that a person who grows agricultural products that his family eats will not add poisonous chemicals and chemical fertilizer to the soil? He won’t grow mutated produce. All of that crap is coming into our country and the population buys it solely because there’s a shortage of produce. When enough produce, quality will immediately become most important. I hope that what I’ve said is convincing?</p><p>
</p><p>A significant increase – on the order of two to three times – in salary in all spheres of the national economy without inflation, and with lower prices for all types of goods within the country. Social tension will decrease.</p><p>
Someone might wonder: what connection could there be between realizing the “Family homestead” program and higher salaries for, say, a salesperson, a trolleybus driver, a nurse, or a teacher? But there is a connection! And an immediate and even direct one at that.</p><p>
Judge for yourself. The majority of businesses has now been privatized and is now in private hands. Those we call oligarchs make fabulous profits, and at whose expense? For the most part at the expense of the minimal salaries of their workers. And what sense does it make to raise this salary from, say, five thousand to twenty, if people are still standing in line for jobs as it is? There’s simply nowhere for people to go.</p><p>
An entirely different picture emerges when a family with its own homestead receives on average thirty thousand a month from working on it (which is absolutely realistic and has been proven in practice) while having minimal living expenses. They don’t need to pay for utilities or spend money on traveling back and forth to work every day, or on eating in cafes in the cities. In order to attract a person living on a homestead to a job at a factory or at some other private manufacturing plant, they’ll have to offer him a salary that is at least one and a half to two times greater than the income he receives from working on his homestead, as well as compensate him for travel and food expenses.</p><p>
These days, an oligarch who has privatized a factory or company or who engages in oil production, might live, for example, in a London castle (which does happen) and receive an income of up to a million dollars a month, while the workers who provide him with this income receive less that even a thousandth of that.</p><p>
Such a situation can’t continue indefinitely. It will inevitably lead to revolution, the proprietor will be deprived of his business, and the government that allowed this kind of inequality will be overthrown. There’s one way out: to share with the workers in a way that’s fair. An oligarch won’t go this route of his own free will, but he’ll see his way clear once certain circumstances arise.</p><p>
We’re talking about a relationship between a homestead owner and the proprietor of an industrial company. But they’ll also have to raise salaries for the people who keep living in city apartments, in order to keep them in their jobs. After all, they’ll also have a choice: to continue working and living only in an urban setting, or to begin building a different way of life.</p><p>
And here’s the last question on this point. Why won’t there be inflation or higher prices?</p><p>
Inflation is always a consequence of concrete, specially created processes. Higher prices are just a result. The reason is man’s separation from a natural way of life. It’s easy to raise prices for gas and food products when people don’t own either one. They are entirely dependent. But try raising the price of apples for a person who has his own garden. It’s absurd. And gas? But there’s a limit to this, too. Gas prices today are so high that it’s much more cost-effective to work two to three hectares of land using your own horse which, by the way, also gives you first-class fertilizer.</p><p>
</p><p>A quick change for the better in the demographic situation. Increased health and rejuvenation of the population.</p><p>
As we well know, the demographic situation in our country is catastrophic. And even this word doesn’t quite fit. If the population in our country is falling by nearly a million people a year in times of peace – then that’s monstrous! The rulers of such a country should conceal their names from the population and their descendants. Talk about how we have to change the current situation is nothing but pitiful prattle. Nothing will change as a result of it. Of course we do need to increase material support for those who give birth, but again, material support doesn’t change anything fundamentally.</p><p>
Many thousands of years of history show that women stop giving birth when they can’t see any clear future for their children. First of all, we need to explicitly and clearly define the future growth of our entire society and, specifically, of the family as the primary cell within it.</p><p>
The city of Vladimir “Anastasia” Foundation conducted a survey of families who were planning to establish their own family homesteads. Out of the more than two thousand surveyed, 1995 of them answered that they would have children. They would like to have three or more.</p><p>
Those who can’t have their own children for health reasons, are planning to adopt children from orphanages. Why does something like this happen? Well, because when a person creates a beautiful, living oasis, he understands that he’s creating something eternal, and he wants his children to enjoy life, too.</p><p>
As far as increased health and rejuvenation are concerned, let’s turn once again to experience. Look at how your grandfathers and grandmothers come alive and grow younger when they go out to their dachas in the spring. And do I need to offer proof for the fact that a pregnant woman who consumes ecologically pure produce, drinks pure water, and breathes clean air, will give birth to healthy children? Immeasurably healthier than today’s.</p><p>
</p><p>A solution to the question of the country’s ability to defend itself. A significant reduction in numbers of weapons, resulting, in coming years, in the total eradication of bribery, corruption, racketeering and terrorism.</p><p>
Combat readiness and morale among today’s Armed Forces, including internal security troops and the police, have already passed zero and are slipping into the negative figures. It’s no secret to anyone how problematic it is for military recruitment offices to meet quotas for recruiting young people for military service. Among young people, rejecting one’s military obligation has come to be considered not shameful, but virtuous. Those who are a bit wealthier try to buy their way out of serving, and those who are a little poorer try to “exempt” themselves, sometimes going so far as to injure themselves.</p><p>
Recruits from the poor strata of the population are carelessly dragged into the army . This kind of army is in no shape to defend anyone or anything from a serious enemy. Besides that, it is potentially dangerous for the very country that maintains it.</p><p>
Let’s figure this out: who is it that a soldier in the Russian Army is called on to protect? “The Motherland,” will be the standard answer. But today the concept of the Motherland has been eroded, and many people have a hard time imagining what the Motherland even is. Not so long ago at all, Russian officers and soldiers swore allegiance to the USSR, which also happened to be the Motherland. Suddenly the borders changed, and a portion of that territory became completely non-motherland. Dislocated military forces in this territory were even called occupiers. So, that leaves defending people in those remaining territories that are now called “Russia.” But which people? Bribe-taking officials? Oligarchs? One’s own family? But if an officer or soldier is from a poor family, then against whom should he be defending Russia?</p><p>
On the government level, propaganda has been asserting for more than ten years now that we’re building “a civilized democratic government on the Western model.” Now think about it: how can Russian soldiers engage in battle against NATO or US troops if they’ve already been taught that NATO and the US are civilized and developed and that we, consequently, are undeveloped and uncivilized? It’s absurd. Is this psychological abracadabra or an intentional, well thought-out tactic? People think that a professional army is the panacea, the way out of this resulting dead-end. But this is even more absurd. A professional army, as we all know, consists of mercenaries who take up arms and shoot whoever they’re told to shoot, for money. They take orders from whoever pays them more.</p><p>
There have been numerous cases throughout history in which governments have been wary of bringing mercenary armies back to their countries. That was the case in Ancient Rome, and a similar danger exists in the US. It already also exists locally, here in Russia.</p><p>
A professional army should fight continuously, preferably not on the territory of the government that maintains it. If the army returns to its home country, it will inevitably be sought after by forces opposing the existing rulers or will break apart into numerous groups, a portion of which will turn into armed gangs. The great majority of armed mercenaries don’t end up unemployed. If people don’t offer them work, they’ll find it themselves, and in their usual line of work. What’s more, it’s very easy to buy an army composed of people who are serving only for money.</p><p>
And so, imagine a foreign military base located in Georgia, Turkmenistan or Ukraine, whose soldiers earn three thousand dollars a month, while ours earn only five hundred. But we don’t need to just imagine it! Concrete examples already exist right here at home. Look at the great number of highly-qualified, professionally-trained officers of the former KGB who now provide security services for commercial businesses, including foreign banks.</p><p>
And so where’s the solution? There is one, and only one. We have to arrange things so that Russian soldiers and officers and generals have something to defend.</p><p>
</p><p>When each Lieutenant in the Russian Army, internal security troops and the police is commissioned as a lieutenant and receives the little star on his epaulettes, he should also have the right to receive one hectare of land so that he can establish his own future family homestead.</p><p>
</p><p>The allotted land should be given out not in the “boonies,” but in choice territories that the government has set aside specially for settlements. The officer can choose his hectare himself within the boundaries of this territory. And when he comes here for a visit, he – either on his own or with his parents – can plant a young garden, dig a pond and pick a spot to build a cottage.</p><p>
And it doesn’t matter if his orders oblige him to travel to various regions or even other countries to fulfill his service. It doesn’t matter if, for now, he lives in an officer’s dormitory or barracks, or even in a tent out in the field. Each officer in the Russian Army should know: back there, in the spot he’s chosen with his heart, his garden will bloom in the spring, the garden of his small motherland. And when the girl who likes him sees that little star on his epaulettes, she’ll know: her beloved has a future, has a Motherland, has a family nest for their future children.</p><p>
And it doesn’t matter if for now she has to share the trying conditions of an officer’s life with her beloved, and it doesn’t matter if they only go to their small motherland once a year on leave and dream and plan their future homestead. Plan where to dig the pond and where to put the house.</p><p>
And it doesn’t matter if they have to spend a month of their leave on their land in a tent. Even if they do, they’ll feel a joy to which nothing else can compare: the joy of the vision of their family’s beautiful future.</p><p>
It doesn’t matter if the trees of their future garden are still tiny and if they can barely see their homestead’s future living green fence. The main thing is – these things are already there, and they’ll grow and bloom as they wait for them – their creators.</p><p>
</p><p>If an officer’s wife becomes pregnant, the government is obliged, within three months, to erect a small cottage with all modern conveniences on the designated spot on their land, using plans chosen by the future parents. (Today’s technologies make this possible.)</p><p>
</p><p>And the wife of the Russian officer will spend the last months of her pregnancy in her very own home. Maybe her parents will be in this house. Maybe she’ll be there alone and will spend time with pleasant neighbors. But the main thing is that around her and inside her she’ll have the positive emotions that are so essential. Because around her will be the space of her small motherland. Her and her beloved’s motherland.</p><p>
And she won’t go to some overseas country to have her baby, or even to that “incubator” they for some reason call a “maternity ward.” The officer’s wife will give birth to her baby on her own homestead, just as many women are already doing. Let her do it under a doctor’s supervision. That’s fine, but at home, in a familiar and favorable and benevolent setting, not in a chair that’s heard the moans and shrieks of hundreds of laboring mothers.</p><p>
</p><p>A Russian officer’s child should be born only on his own family homestead.</p><p>
</p><p>And it doesn’t matter if at that moment the young lieutenant happens to be somewhere far away. He’ll hear the first joyful cry of his child. He’ll surely hear it and sense it, and then no enemy will make his way onto his great Motherland. He – a young lieutenant, a Russian officer – will not let that enemy through. Because in the heart of his great Motherland lies his little – but nearest and dearest – small Motherland. Where in his blooming garden, his beloved is holding the tiny hand of his small son, who is trying to take his first little steps in life.</p><p>
Society! Our society! Of which our State consists, can arrange things right now so that the young mama – the wife of a Russian officer – doesn’t have to think about how to get food for her child. She should be provided for. It doesn’t matter if it’s not in the same way as oligarchs’ wives. And she doesn’t need cheap affectations like expensive cars. She’ll have something more – love, and a future. She’s doing what’s most important – she’s reviving the Motherland. That’s her most important work, her most important task.</p><p>
And society should pay her a salary equal to her husband’s. That’s too little pay, of course, for her great creation, but let a step like this serve as the beginning of a good will gesture by society and the government.</p><p>
It’s already possible to do this, now. All we have to do is not confuse people with higher economic concepts.</p><p>
The oil pipeline rains dollars down on Russia. And why doesn’t even a tiny drop of this rain fall on the Russian officer, his wife, his child, and small motherland?</p><p>
Who thought up this way of doing things, while hiding behind the supposed panacea for all ills – democracy?</p><p>
Is it really democracy, when Russia’s low-income soldiers and officers are obliged to defend the well-off and their compounds on Rublev Highway and great numbers of people like them in other regions of the country? That’s not democracy – it’s insane-o-cracy!</p><p>
And if we don’t transform this insanity, we’ll have no protection and no security. Regular citizens won’t have it, and neither will the President, and the oligarchs – small or powerful – definitely won’t have it.</p><p>
Corruption, drug addiction and the proverbial traffic cop who extracts bribes from drivers will vanish if we destroy this insanity.</p><p>
Now, tell me why a traffic police officer should stand out on the road and breathe into his lungs the roadside dust and fumes from the exhaust pipes of the expensive and not so expensive cars that pass by? It’s as if they’re all smart and he’s an idiot. He stands there ensuring their safety and getting a beggarly pay for doing so.</p><p>
And if he doesn’t take bribes from these cars’ drivers, his relatives will ridicule him and start to think he really is abnormal. His wife will start nagging him, and his children will turn their back on their father who doesn’t even have the money to buy them some not very stylish jeans.</p><p>
And he’s not afraid of his own security services – if they fire him, well, it’s no big loss. This job won’t provide for his family if he does his work honestly. Which means he has to look for a different job? But what kind? The kind where he can remain honest and be provided for?</p><p>
So there he stands in the dust and the roadside fumes and extracts bribes. And society doesn’t particularly judge him for it – people pay up. So what are you going to do? We’re all becoming like him, society thinks. And that’s terrifying! Because we’re growing used to this! We’re ceasing to dream about other scenarios.</p><p>
We’re growing used to crowds of prostitutes, homeless children, gangsters. We’re growing used to the circus we call “elections.” Or are we being trained to?</p><p>
But really, until recently, what a person living in a Russian village feared most was the social condemnation of his fellow villagers: “She’s a floozy,” or “He’s a bad husband.”</p><p>
And so, that time needs to come back again. A time will surely come again when the most pleasant thing for a Russian will be society’s estimation: “He’s a good person,” “His children are thoughtful and well brought up,” or “His homestead is beautiful.” And then there will be no criminal activity, no corruption, no drug addiction. This time will surely come.</p><p>
</p><p>An elderly man with graying hair sits on a bench in a shady garden and gently strokes the brown-haired head of his three year-old granddaughter who’s leaned against his chest. His eleven year-old grandson has taken the general’s uniform coat that was hanging on the back of the bench and is trying it on for size. There are two large general’s stars on the epaulettes of the coat. But there used to be two tiny lieutenant’s stars.</p><p>
But that’s not the most important thing, thinks the graying general as he glances at his grandchildren. The most important thing is that he created this garden, the pond and the entire beautiful space of his family homestead and kept them safe – his small motherland in the heart of Russia – for his grandchildren. He kept Russia safe. And She is blossoming! His Motherland! The fresh breeze carries the sweet scent of her gardens throughout the whole world. And the interplanetary winds tell other worlds of the Earth’s blossoming. And the stars in the sky burn with sweet envy and dream of meeting visitors from the Earth, the wise and light daughters and sons of God.</p><p>
That’s the way it will be! But for now… Do you hear, lieutenants, the way the heart of the Russian Land beats like an alarm bell?! Do you hear it asking: take a little bit of me for yourself and plant gardens. I will grow a heavenly space for each of you and give you eternity?!</p><p>
Do you hear it? You will surely hear it!</p><p>
An end to the outflow of capital from the country and the opposite, an influx of capital into Russia; the return of intellectual resources;</p><p>
I can prove in theory that something like this will happen if Anastasia’s program is fully adopted. Well-known scholars and thesis students are showing this in theory.;</p><p>
We can also polemicize about this question. Only practical experience can provide indisputable proof. And it has provided it.</p><p>
People from the former Soviet states and other foreign countries have begun moving to settlements that are already being built, settlements without any solid legal status. For example, I know that in one settlement alone, near the city of Vladimir, a teacher from Turkmenistan is building, and so is a young couple from the USA. We also see something similar going on in many of the other settlements being built on the territories of Russia and Ukraine. Instead of waiting for a law that will allot them land, they’re trying to work within existing laws and are buying land. They’re buying their motherland. It’s society’s obligation, the government’s obligation to return this money to them. Otherwise curses will fall on everyone who had the bright idea to make a person who was born on earth pay for the right to settle the land on which he was born.</p><p>
But in spite of this, people are returning, and it doesn’t matter if, for now, it’s only a very few. You can judge for yourself what will happen once a favorable set of circumstances arises, i.e., adoption of the law about allotting every family that wants one a parcel of land for a family homestead.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>A Letter to the President of Russia from Germany</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>Office of the President of the Russian Federation</p><p>
Staraya Ploschad, 4, 102132, Moscow</p><p>
</p><p>ANASTASIA e.V.</p><p>Schuetzlerbergerstr. 43</p><p>D-67468 Frankeneck</p><p>Telefon: +49 6325 955 99 39</p><p>Fax: +49 6325 18 38 59</p><p>www.anastasia-de.com</p><p>E-Mail: info@anastasia-de.com</p><p>ANASTASIA e.V.</p><p>
</p><p>To the Esteemed President of Russia, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin:</p><p>
This letter is from former citizens of a country that no longer exists – the USSR. For a variety of reasons, many of us have ended up abroad. Germany became a refuge for more than three million emigrants from the USSR. After rushing to get there and finding a Western, “civilized paradise,” many realized that in the process they had also lost their Motherland, without which a person can really never be completely happy.</p><p>
Today in Russia an entirely new idea has appeared, one that guarantees both a person’s physical and spiritual health, and which many people of various nationalities have embraced, including those in Western European countries. Thanks to this idea, we’ve understood that at this moment Russia possesses the spiritual potential necessary to give new life to a harmonious person and recreate a harmonious State.</p><p>
One can learn about this idea in more detail in the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series of books by Vladimir Megre. All told, nearly 6 million copies of his books have been printed. Through V. Megre’s books, Russians, residents of the CIS and other countries have received that beautiful hope for rebirth that is essential for every person, family and State.</p><p>
The essence of the idea is as follows:</p><p>
Each family or citizen should have the right to receive, at no cost, 1 hectare of land, on which they will establish their small motherland, their family homestead, which could be passed from generation to generation as an inheritance. A person was born on the land and should have his own concrete little piece of the Motherland that is created and nurtured with his own two hands and the hands of several generations of his extended family.</p><p>
In one of your addresses, you noted that Russia was born and lived for a long time in the villages, on the land, and that this is her path. We agree with this! Having tasted the joy of Western civilization, we’ve come to understand clearly that this fabled civilization has itself spawned drug addiction, prostitution, homeless children, thievery and murder. And we’re not even talking here about Europe’s most painful problems – ecological and demographic problems. Russia, too, receives this whole bouquet of problems when it attempts to enact reforms according the Western model. Many in the West today are beginning to understand that the path that Western democratic governments are following leads to a dead end, if not to self-destruction.</p><p>
Russia has gone through extremely difficult, centuries-long ordeals, as a result of which a certain spirit has been fostered in the people. And thanks to it, in an epoch of the most cruel spiritual and ecological crisis, Russians can halt at the edge of the abyss and, in defiance of everything give birth, not only to a new national idea – of cultivating a new life – but also avert the catastrophe of the self-destruction of all of mankind.</p><p>
We, former citizens of the USSR, have come to fully understand the simple concept of the Motherland. Having received foreign citizenship or having given up our previous citizenship, many of us understood that our heart and soul have remained in the spots where we spent the greater part of our lives.</p><p>
We would like to return to Russia and begin creating our family homesteads and establishing settlements of a new type. The activity associated with establishing a family homestead will lead to a qualitative change in the lives of a huge community of people. We understand that much depends on us, on our labor, skills and experience. Many of us have acquired new professions in Europe, learned foreign languages, and some have their own businesses. No small number has begun studying the experience of Western eco-settlements and non-traditional farming methods.</p><p>
In our settlements we will build schools, clubs and hospitals ourselves. We might not need special government subsidies, since you’ll find all possible specialists among us, and we are prepared to and capable of seeking out means and opportunities on our own.</p><p>
This kind of activity will lead to a qualitative change in the lives of a huge number of people. Lands that have up until now laid unclaimed, abandoned and depleted will become fertile gardens, and in them will be born a generation of new Russians, with a new consciousness, outlook and worldview.</p><p>
By doing this, we all wish to help our relatives and those close to us who now live in Russia and the CIS, which will also help solve problems connected to the younger generation, employment and the housing question. We are prepared right now to bring to bear the efforts of several generations of our families, as well as our skills, experience, knowledge and finances to jointly create of a powerful, majestic and proud Motherland – Russia.</p><p>
In order to realize this idea, we request that you give consideration to the following proposals:</p><p>
1. To offer each family or single citizen who wants one the right to receive, at no cost, 1 hectare of land for lifetime ownership with the right to inheritance, without the right of sale, for the creation of a family homestead.</p><p>
2. To simplify the procedures for receiving Russian citizenship for people who wish to create their small motherland and a great Russia, and who were born within the territories of the RSFSR or other republics of the former Soviet Union and who were previously citizens of the USSR.</p><p>
With hope and respect,</p><p>
Future citizens of Russia</p><p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, no answer at all to this letter from Russia followed. Not even a simple form letter from some official arrived. And here these Russian-speaking Russians living in Germany are holding on to this post office slip informing them that the Office of the Russian President received their letter. And what of it? That’s consistent. You aren’t the only ones they don’t answer. They don’t answer those of us who live here in Russia, either. On the Internet on our site there’s already a whole section of letters written in English, too, including letters to the Russian President, too. For five years, people have been writing on this very same topic – family homesteads – but there hasn’t been an answer to a single letter. There’s been no answer, to either collective or individual letters.</p><p>
As you’ll soon understand, it couldn’t be any other way, because in Russia there are forces that have placed themselves higher than the President and the Government. They seem to think they stand above the people, but I think they’re mistaken in their thinking. You can, of course, rise above a drunken people. But above a people in whose hearts there lives a dream for the future and a burning desire to make this dream a reality – no such force exists and cannot exist.</p><p>
It falls to me, in place of the officials and the President, to answer you, my dear former fellow citizens.</p><p>
First of all, thank you to those of you who now live in Germany, America, Israel, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Italy and France, Georgia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, in Mongolia. It’s thanks to your efforts that the little books about Anastasia have been translated and published in the countries where you currently reside. I didn’t know you, and therefore couldn’t ask you to do this. But I do know something else. I know how your hearts fluttered and how you went to see publishers and translators and how, when they didn’t understand you, you tried to translate and publish my books yourselves. As has happened in, for example, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, in Canada and America.</p><p>
And then people began to understand you! I first felt this in Germany when I appeared before readers in Berlin and Stuttgart.</p><p>
Russian-speaking Germans who had emigrated from Russia to Germany, as well as native-born residents who didn’t know Russian, sat together in packed halls. They were there in roughly equal numbers. I know that Germans who’ve come from Russia and native-born residents aren’t on particularly friendly terms with each other. But here they were sitting together and cordially attempting to explain to each other a translation from the Russian that was probably not always comprehensible. I used to think of Germans as a pedantic and not strongly emotional nation. But life has shown otherwise. It was a German farmer who, after reading the little book about Anastasia, got in his car and set off for Siberia. He set off, not knowing the language or Russian roads, or the Russian traffic police or the weather. And he got there. He returned home and brought his friends presents from Russia.</p><p>
Of course, huge thanks to all of you who, on your own initiative, and sometimes with your own money, have translated and published the books abroad. But you know, it isn’t just about the books. The most important thing is something else. Thank you for your understanding and support of the ideas and the dream coming out of Siberian Russia. Now this dream is no longer just Russian. It’s in equal measure yours. May you succeed in preserving it, in manifesting it and passing it on to your children so they can perfect it.</p><p>
I don’t know who’s done something more significant: Anastasia with her passionate pronouncements, the books, or all those who have taken up the idea like a torch and have carried it forth.</p><p>
“I will give people my whole Soul. I’ll stand my ground in people with my own soul. Evil – prepare to leave the earth,” Anastasia said.</p><p>
I thought those were simply words. But life has shown me that they are not simple.</p><p>
Her dream has burst into little flames in the souls of millions of people spread across various countries, people of different nationalities and denominations. This dream has already become not just Anastasia’s dream. It belongs to many people, and it is enduring. Now it will last for centuries to come, for all eternity.</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0811>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>11. The Hectare - A Little Piece of Planet Earth</p></h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>
People sometimes say to me, “Why do you get so fired up about the hectare? There are more important things.” But I think that there’s nothing more important in our lives today than returning to the earth its primordial blossoming.</p><p>
And that’s why I talk about a hectare of family land, because something immeasurably more significant lies behind it. I don’t always have the brains or intellect, or maybe the temperament to explain it, but when I succeed even a little bit and people understand – that’s a victory.</p><p>
That’s how it was that one time. It was 2003. Switzerland. Zurich. An international conference. The organizers invited me to it and gave me time to speak. I began talking about this idea that had been born in Russia, but the audience wasn’t really getting it.</p><p>
A question from the audience:</p><p>
“How can you draw a connection between a hectare of land to a person’s spiritual formation? Maybe problems of farming are important for Russia, but in Europe we solved these questions long ago. We’ve come together here to talk about spirituality.”</p><p>
A bit agitated, I began to answer:</p><p>
“I’m talking about a hectare of land, about establishing a family homestead on it, and some people will think that’s something primitive. That we have to talk about great science, about spirituality, because that’s the topic of this prestigious European conference. I know – the organizers told me this – that right now in this hall before me sit innovative pedagogues, philosophers and writers who are well-known in Europe, and whose works are about spirituality, as well as other, no less important people who reflect on the topic of spirituality. But I’m talking about a hectare of land precisely because I know who’s sitting in front of me right now in this hall.</p><p>
“Ladies and gentlemen, I’m convinced that concepts like love and spirituality must surely have their material manifestation.</p><p>
“The hectare of land that I have in mind, and that Anastasia talks about, is not simply a hectare of land. It’s a space through which you will be connected to the cosmos. All the planets of the Universe will respond to this space and thus, to you, too. They will be your friends, helpers and co-creators.</p><p>
“Look at what happens according to the laws of nature: a regular flower – a daisy – it, too is inseparably connected to the cosmos, to the planets, to the sun. The flower opens up its petals when the sun rises and closes them when the sun sets. They are united in harmony with each other. Trillions of kilometers and light years cannot separate them. They are together – the great sun and the little earth flower. They know that only together do they serve as creators of the great harmony of the universe.</p><p>
“But each blade of grass on the earth responds not just to the sun. It also responds to the other planets, it responds to a person, to the energy of his feelings.</p><p>
“Scientists carried out the following experiment. They hooked up sensors to a plant, a flowering houseplant, and the instrument’s needles registered the slightest energetic impulses coming from the flower. Several people took turns coming into the room. One would pass by, the other would come up and water the flower, and the third would come in and tear off a leaf. The instrument noted that when the person tore off a leaf would come in, the plant would begin to be agitated, and the instrument’s needle would fluctuate.</p><p>
“We can often observe the following phenomenon, too: flowers wilt when their owner goes away. In other words, we understand that all plants respond to people. They can love a person, or they can not love him. Consequently, they can communicate this love or non-love to their planets.</p><p>
“And now, imagine that you have a certain space, a hectare of land. It’s not simply a hectare of land on which you’ve planted some potatoes that you’ll sell, but a hectare of land on which you’ve begun to create, with a certain level of awareness and a certain level of spirituality.</p><p>
“You have your own territory, with a multitude of plants that have been planted not by hired workers, but directly by you. Each plant, each blade of grass regards you lovingly, and these very plants, these living beings, are capable of gathering together all the best energies of the Universe for you. Gathering them together and giving them to you. Plants are nourished not by the energy of the earth. You yourselves know that there are plants that can grow without soil.</p><p>
“Five thousand years about in Ancient Egypt there lived priests who created a multitude of religions. And these priests governed entire peoples. These priests were the wealthiest people of that time. The cellars of their palaces held trunks of gold and valuables, and they knew a great many secret sciences, and the pharaoh would come to them for advice and money. But each of these high-ranking priests had his own hectare of land on which he wouldn’t allow the slaves to work. These wealthiest of people, who knew a multitude of sciences, also knew the secret of a hectare of land. On the walls of the ancient temples of Egypt, the priests’ temples, was written, ‘Do not accept food from your slave.’ That’s one example.</p><p>
</p><p>“A second example. In Ancient Rome the senators issued a decree that if slave knew how to work the land and he was given land, then that slave could be sold to a different master only together with his land, so that outsiders wouldn’t have access to what was growing on that land. But why would the Roman senators grant land to some slaves? And give them money, besides, so that they could build themselves a home there? For one reason and one reason alone – so that they could take 10% of the harvest raised and nurtured by the love and care of the person who had grown it. Only this kind of produce can bring benefit.</p><p>
“The Egyptian priests and the Ancient Roman senators knew what kind of food was wholesome for people. The produce we eat now shouldn’t under any circumstances be used for food: it’s ‘dead’ food. There’s a very big difference between a berry that you pick from a bush and eat right then and a berry that’s sold in a store. The problem isn’t that it’s not fresh. The problem is that there’s no energy in it. It can’t nourish a person’s soul. And I’m not even talking here about how our technocratic world has created types of plants that are mutants.</p><p>
“And so, if you don’t have your own hectare of land, then there’s nowhere you’ll be able to find food worthy of a human. You can take your money and buy some vegetables. But you need to know that these vegetables didn’t grow for you. They didn’t really grow for people at all. They grew for money.</p><p>
“There’s no illness that a Space of Love, the space you’ve created with your own hands and soul, couldn’t cure.</p><p>
“People are the children of God. The plant and animal world, the air and the space surrounding us are also God’s creations. And all of this together is nothing more than the manifestation of God’s spirit. If someone calls himself a highly spiritual person, then let him show us the manifestation of his spirituality.</p><p>
“Imagine that God is looking down on you from above right now. And he sees that someone’s driving a tram, that one of his children is building a building, and that someone is standing in a store and making sales at a counter – he’s a salesperson. God did not create professions like these. These are professions for slaves. God didn’t want His children to be slaves. And He created a marvelous world and handed it over to His children to make use of. Take it and use it! But in order to do this, we need to understand this world. Understand what a moon is, and understand what a little grass called milfoil is.</p><p>
“And so, then, what is a hectare of land? Is it a place where a person should work by the sweat of his brow? NO! It’s a place where a person shouldn’t work at all! It’s a place, through which a person should drive the world. Tell me, who is more pleasing to God: the person who drives a tram, or a person who may have only a small little piece of earth, but turns it into a paradise? Of course, the second.</p><p>
“Can we open up a path to the cosmos for today’s people? And can we teach them to cultivate Mars and the Moon? No, that’s impossible! Because weapons will appear there, and filth will appear, and there will be the same kinds of wars as there are on Earth. But man is created to cultivate other worlds. And this will take place only when man understands and cultivates Earth. The method for cultivating the Universe’s planets is not technological at all. It’s telepathic.</p><p>
“Man needs to realize where the true beauty of the universe lies.</p><p>
“Your city Zurich is considered beautiful. We can say it’s beautiful a thousand times. But what is it, specifically, that’s beautiful in it? Yes, it’s very clean here, yes, and there are a lot of people who appear well-off. But is the earth that’s covered with that asphalt there really beautiful? Is it really a good thing that there are only a few spots where green islands poke their way through? Is it really a good thing that in the center of your city a marvelous tree – the cedar – is dying? It’s choking on cinders. Choking on exhaust fumes. It’s not the only thing that’s dying. It’s not the only thing that’s choking. The person who walks through this city also chokes on these gases.</p><p>
“We should think about what we’ve wrought on this earth. And it’s better to speak in very simple terms. Let’s each take a little plot of our land, gather up all our intellect and all our spirituality and create a teeny-tiny, but tangible paradise. Let’s each turn a small little piece of earth on our big planet into a flowering garden by manifesting our spirituality, just as God did. If millions of people in various countries do this, then the entire earth will be a flowering garden, and there will be no wars, because millions of people will be occupied by great creation. And if Russians fall upon Switzerland or Germany, then it will only be because they want to delight in contemplating the beautiful living oases and adopt what others have learned about manifesting true spirituality.</p><p>
“Unfortunately Russia is now striving to resemble the West. In their speeches, Russian politicians speaking about Western countries, use phrases like “developed,” and “civilized,” and encourage people to catch up to them in terms of “development” and “civilization.” Our politicians still aren’t aware of the fact that we can not only catch up, but even significantly outpace them. But this can only happen if we run in the opposite direction.</p><p>
“I don’t in the slightest want to disparage or offend your Western civilization. But after all, we’re talking about spirituality, and we should be honest with each other. Spirituality can’t be measured only by material prosperity or technical achievements. This one-sided, technocratic path for human development will inevitably lead it to the abyss. Those of you who have come together here doubtless recognize this fact, but if you do, then you should also recognize you’re at the head of those running toward the abyss, and we’re right behind you. Try to stop and think about what has happened with our world. If you’re able to recognize this, then call out to those running behind you, ‘Stop, guys! Stop running! There’s an abyss here, and we’ve already reached the edge of it. Find a different path.’</p><p>
“All together, by listening to our hearts, we should move from talking about spirituality to manifesting it. One hectare is only the tiniest point on planet Earth. But millions of these points will turn the whole planet into a flowering garden. With trillions of flower petals, with the happy smiles of children and old people, they will tell the Universe:</p><p>
“‘The people of Earth are ready for great co-creation.’</p><p>
“‘O man, we await you,’ the planets of the Universe will answer. ‘We await you, the worthy son of God.’</p><p>
“Our millennium has laid down the beginning of the great transformation on Earth. Tens of thousands of Russian families are already rushing to their hectares. A father and mother who are actually creating a Space of Love for their children are more spiritual than the most famous wise men who only talk about spirituality.</p><p>
“May the spirit of each person grow from the earth as a beautiful flower, as a tree with a sweet-smelling fruit, and may the very same thing happen on each and every hectare of our planet.”</p><p>
</p><p>After these words complete silence reigned in the hall for some time, and then – thunderous applause.</p><p>
I appeared again in Zurich the next day, too. And again the hall was full. And our former countrymen were here, too.</p><p>
I don’t think I spoke very coherently, especially since it was through a translator. But people didn’t walk out. They listened, because it was not just I who spoke with the people in this hall – a great force was speaking, too. A very simple and concrete and at the same time unusual force that has been preserved in the depths of the human soul for millennia – a nostalgia for the true image of the life of man the creator.</p><p>
And then I thought, “Do I even need to try to prove to anyone that all of Russia’s sons and daughters who have been carried off by an ill wind will return to Russia? They will return!” You’ll recall Anastasia’s words:</p><p>
“On this day guests will come to Russia. All those whom the land has brought forth as Atlanteans will as prodigal sons return. And may bards throughout the land play their guitars. And may old folks write letters to their children, and may all children write letters to their parents. And you and I will suddenly grow very young. As people will be young for the very first time.”</p><p>

<div class=chapter id=0812>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>12. A Government of the People</p></h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>There’s another question I’d like to address to readers of the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series of books.</p><p>
A process is currently underway in which you are creating a national program for the development of the Russian Government. A number of the articles are being published in almanacs, and a number of them are posted in the Internet on the “Anastasia” website. From what I’ve seen, the overwhelming majority of this material is very interesting. But there’s one question that hasn’t been highlighted enough – the question of governance. And this is an exceedingly important question. Let’s think about it a bit together. And to start us off, I’ll share my conclusions.</p><p>
The government changes frequently. Even within just the last hundred years people have lived under the tsar, and under the Communists, and under several democratic leaders. The government changes, but life doesn’t change for the better. Why not? Is it that bad people are always coming to power? That’s doubtful. It’s more likely that the system that’s developed turns any politicians who come to power into incompetent bureaucrats unable to solve the question of how to tangibly improve the life of the society.</p><p>
Take the most recent terms of the legislature. It seems like we vote for normal people with families, but when they serve, what we get is legislation that is, to say the least, strange. Why is this? Maybe when they come into power, they find themselves in a different world, detached from the people? An apartment in a building for deputies, a car with flashing lights, an office the people can’t get into, all possible perks, and the vanity of vanities.</p><p>
Anastasia’s grandfather suggested an interesting draft for a bill for the deputies. They should all be granted land and have to live in settlements built on that land, alongside the people. Tatyana Borodina, a citizen of Ukraine and a law school graduate, fleshed out this draft for a bill, and I think it’s worthy of attention, and so I decided to include its main articles in this book and ask readers to propose it to deputies of the legislatures at all levels in their regions.</p><p>
I also urge readers to definitely participate in regional and national elections, but to vote only for those candidates for the Duma who live on their own homesteads.</p><p>
But is it only a stamp in the passport shows that this or that citizen belongs to Russia? There have been many cases when a candidate for office has Russian citizenship, an apartment and a residence permit, but his fancy homestead is located in a different country. Will he really be thinking about the needs of the Russian people? It’s more likely that his thoughts will head in an entirely different direction.</p><p>
If a candidate has his own small motherland – his own family homestead in Russia – and he lives on it among Russian citizens, then we can expect him to work for the good of these citizens and of the great Motherland.</p><p>
Many people are beginning to understand this. Students are even beginning to write laws to help our legislators.</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>A Law of Russia Concerning Family Homestead Settlements, Created by People’s Deputies of Russia, on All Levels (Draft)</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>The law defines the legal, social and economic bases for the creation and functioning of family homestead settlements created by people’s deputies of Russia, and of family homesteads, and also guarantees the right, declared in the Constitution of Russia, of citizens of Russia to land as a basic national treasure.</p><p>
The law is oriented toward creation of all conditions necessary for the people’s deputy of Russia to work in a high-quality and fruitful way on developing, creating and passing the laws of Russia, and also toward guaranteeing his maximum close proximity to voters.</p><p>
</p><p>Article 1. Basic Terms and Concepts Used in the Law</p><p>
In the present Law, terms are used with the following meanings:</p><p>
family homestead – a plot of land from 1 to 1.3 hectares in area, granted to citizens of Russia of legal age, for their lifetime use, with right to hereditary transmission, without taxation of the land and harvest;</p><p>
family homestead settlement – a populated area organized on the basis of local self-government, consisting of family homesteads and facilities of cultural and social purpose;</p><p>
lifetime use – unconditional possession and use of the plot of earth, free of charge and without time limit;</p><p>
living fence – vegetation consisting of trees and bushes planted along the perimeter of the family homestead and homestead settlement.</p><p>
</p><p>Article 2. Legislation Concerning Family Homesteads and Family Homestead Settlements</p><p>
Arrangements connected to granting a parcel of land to a people’s deputy of Russia, the determination of the legal status of a family homestead and a family homestead settlement, and their functioning are regulated by the Constitution of Russia, by the Land Code of Russia, by the current Law, by the Law of Russia “Concerning Family Homesteads and Family Homestead Settlements in Russia” and by other laws.</p><p>
</p><p>Article 3. Basic Principles of Legislation Concerning Family Homestead Settlements</p><p>
Upon creation of family homestead settlements by the people’s deputies of Russia, it is necessary to conform to the following basic principles:</p><p>
adherence to the law;</p><p>
creation of conditions for all citizens of Russia to realize the right of to land as a basic national treasure;</p><p>
lack of charge, conditions or time limit for possession and use of the plot of land granted for the creation of a family homestead;</p><p>
freedom of owners of family homesteads from payment of taxes on the sale of products grown and produced on the family homestead;</p><p>
creation of one family homestead settlement by one people’s deputy of Russia of the current Duma;</p><p>
other principles.</p><p>
</p><p>Article 4. The Scope of the Law</p><p>
The influence of the current Law extends both to people’s deputies of Russia at all levels who have been elected in accordance with legislation regarding elections, as well as to Russian citizens of legal age who have expressed a wish to live on a family homestead organized according to principles laid out in the given Law.</p><p>
</p><p>Article 5. Granting of a Plot of Land to a People’s Deputy of Russia for the Creation of a Family Homestead Settlement</p><p>
1. In the course of a year from the date of his election, each people’s deputy of Russia of both the current and subsequent Dumas will be granted a parcel of land not less than 150 hectares in size for the creation of a family homestead settlement (hereafter – “parcel of land.”)</p><p>
2. When a people’s deputy of Russia is elected in accordance with the proportional system, within a federal, multi-member electoral district, based on lists of deputy candidates from the political parties and the political parties’ voting blocks, a parcel of land is granted to the people’s deputy of Russia in a region of Russia of his choice.</p><p>
When a people’s deputy of Russia is elected in accordance with the majority system relative to the majority within single-member electoral districts, the parcel of land is granted to him within the boundaries of that electoral district in which the deputy was elected.</p><p>
3. Two or more people’s deputies of Russia are not allowed to create one joint family homestead settlement. Nor are two or more people’s deputies of Russia of the current Duma allowed to reside in one and the same family homestead settlement.</p><p>
4. The parcel of land is granted as a single unit including water sources on lands existing as public or community property. The land can also be seized from individuals who are using it on a permanent basis and transferred to the people’s deputy of Russia for the creation of a family homestead settlement.</p><p>
5. When needed, land can be purchased for public use from owners of plots of land. No later than one year before the proposed purchase, the owner must be notified in writing by the agency making the decision concerning purchase of the plot of land. Purchase of the plot of land is carried out subject to the consent of its owners. The price is set in accordance with a financial and expert appraisal of the land, to be carried out using methods affirmed by the Russian Cabinet.</p><p>
6. A plot of land which is to be added to a parcel of land designated for the creation of a family homestead settlement by a people’s deputy of Russia, but which is owned by a physical or legal entity may, with the consent of the owner, be exchanged for a different plot of land of equal value within the boundaries of the given region or, if the owner wishes, in a different region of Russia.</p><p>
7. Citizens of Russia – owners of plots of land, land equities (shares) that have been allocated in kind (in an actual location) and which adjoin the created family homestead settlement – have the right to transfer the plots of land owned by them free of charge for the creation of family homestead settlements by people’s deputies of Russia and receive a plot of land for lifetime use in the created family homestead settlement for the creation of a family homestead.</p><p>
8. A citizen of Russia who owns a land equity (share) that has not been allocated in kind (in an actual location,) has the right to add it in full or in part (in an area not less than one hectare) to the family homestead settlement created by the people’s deputy of Russia and a plot of land receive in it, with the right of lifetime use for the creation of a family homestead.</p><p>
</p><p>Article 6. Composition of Lands in the Family Homestead Settlement</p><p>
1. Lands of the Family homestead settlement consist of three types of plots of land:</p><p>
plots of land for the creation of family homesteads;</p><p>
plots of land for the creation of family homesteads by children of the people’s deputy of Russia (Reserve Fund) in a quantity not to exceed two plots in each family homestead settlement.</p><p>
2. Plots of land for social and public use are set aside in accordance with the family homestead settlement’s general plan. The area occupied by the given plots of land should constitute no more than 7% of the overall area of the family homestead settlement. The given plots of land fall under the direction of the Community Council of the corresponding family homestead settlement.</p><p>
3. The remaining portion of the parcel of land is divided into plots of land for the creation of family homesteads, with an area of not less than one hectare each. The size of the plots of land can be increased to up to 1.3 hectare depending on the characteristics of the spot’s terrain and other factors.</p><p>
4. It is mandatory that thoroughfares not less than 3-4 meters in width be established between all types of plots of land. The owner has the right to plant a living fence around the perimeter of each plot of land granted for the creation of a family homestead.</p><p>
5. On the plots of land intended for the creation of a family homestead, citizens of Russia have the right to plant vegetation consisting of trees and bushes (including forest trees,) create man-made reservoirs, build dwellings and structures, erect utility sheds and other objects, while observing the principles of good neighborliness.</p><p>
</p><p>Article 7. The Procedure for Granting Plots of Land Intended for the Creation of Family Homesteads to Citizens of Russia</p><p>
1. In the created family homestead settlement, the people’s deputy of Russia has the right to first choice of one plot of land for lifetime use with right to hereditary transmission for the creation of a family homestead.</p><p>
2. Each child of a people’s deputy of Russia who has his own family has the right to receive a plot of land for lifetime use for the creation of a family homestead.</p><p>
3. It is mandatory for one or two plots of land in the family homestead settlement to be granted to children who are residents of orphanages, or are refugees.</p><p>
4. The people’s deputy of Russia has the right to distribute up to 30% of the remaining quantity of plots of land to citizens of Russia for the creation of family homesteads as he sees fit.</p><p>
5. The remaining plots of land should be distributed to citizens of Russia who belong to various strata of the population (business owners, social services workers, retirees, members of the artistic community, servicemen and women and so on.) Plots of land are distributed among citizens of Russia by means of a lottery carried out transparently at a general assembly of future residents of the family homestead settlement.</p><p>
</p><p>Article 8. The Community Council of the Family Homestead Settlement</p><p>
1. The Community Council of the family homestead settlement is the residents who are connected by full-time residency within the boundaries of the family homestead settlement, which is an independent administrative and community entity.</p><p>
2. The Community Council of the family homestead settlement has the right to create a representative local self-governing body – a family homestead settlement council consisting solely of residents of the given family homestead settlement.</p><p>
3. The people’s deputy of Russia is not allowed to become a candidate in the council election or be elected to the family homestead settlement council. If a people’s deputy of Russia happens to be elected to the family homestead settlement council, the election is declared invalid.</p><p>
4. So as to regulate the particulars of enacting a local self-government, the Community Council of the family homestead settlement has the right, at a meeting of the local council or at a local referendum, to adopt Regulations of the Community Council of the Family Homestead Settlement (hereafter – “Regulations.”) The Regulations are subject to registration in district court.</p><p>
</p><p>Article 9. Status of a Plot of Land for the Creation of a Family Homestead</p><p>
1. A plot of land for the creation of a family homestead is granted for lifetime use with right to hereditary transmission only to a citizen of Russia. A plot of land for the creation of a family homestead may not be granted to foreign citizens or to individuals lacking citizenship, except for individuals who have received the status of refugee in accordance with the procedure established by law (but no more than two families for each family homestead settlement created by a people’s deputy of Russia.)*</p><p>
* A detailed draft of the law and commentary on it will be published in the next issue of the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” almanac. You’ll be able to get a copy of the almanac. And it would be a good thing if readers were to advise deputies of all levels of the government to acquaint themselves with it.</p><p>
</p><p>I don’t know how much time I spent walking around while Anastasia’s grandfather was having a look at the contents of the folder of documents I’d brought with me, when suddenly I heard booming, thunderous and not at all elderly laughter. He kept laughing, even when I quickly went up to him.</p><p>
“That’s great… Boy, you really made me laugh… Thank you… Thank you, Vladimir. And at first I didn’t want to get into it.”</p><p>
“But if you got into it, then why are you laughing? I mean, this is a very serious situation. And of the utmost complexity!”</p><p>
“Of the utmost complexity for who?” Grandfather asked me.</p><p>
“For me, for the readers who want to build the homesteads Anastasia has been talking about.”</p><p>
Maybe my tone when I said this was somewhat annoyed and hurt. Grandfather stopped laughing, looked at me intently and answered, calmly and seriously:</p><p>
“You know, to this day, I really can’t understand why my granddaughter spends time with you, and has children with you to boot. But don’t get insulted at an old man, Vladimir. I can’t understand, which means others won’t, either, but perhaps there’s great meaning in this non-understanding. And so I don’t bear you any ill will. I don’t judge my granddaughter – I delight in her creation.”</p><p>
“But can you give me some comments on what I’ve written?”</p><p>
“I already said it – I delight in the creation.”</p><p>
“In whose creation?”</p><p>
“My granddaughter’s.”</p><p>
“But I was asking you about what I’d written.”</p><p>
Grandfather looked at the folder with the papers. Then he looked silently and intently at me and answered:</p><p>
“Well, Vladimir, I don’t know how necessary is this appeal you’ve written to people, really? Perhaps it’s important for them. For me, what I read is simply a confirmation of the fact that my granddaughter already foresaw all these upheavals ten years ago, and that everything that to you seems to be coming up as opposition – she already turned that around to the good a long time ago.”</p><p>
“But how can you consider insulting the readers and me something good?”</p><p>
“But do you understand who it is that’s insulting you and your readers?”</p><p>
“Some kind of organization under the cover of the Russian Orthodox Church.”</p><p>
“And did a feeling of insult arise in you?”</p><p>
“Yes.”</p><p>
“And that’s a good thing. Now you can understand, not with your head, but with the feelings that have arisen in you and in a great number of readers, how your ancestors were slandered before their descendants. They were called pagans, and for centuries people attributed bad acts to them, bad acts the ancestors didn’t commit. You’re not the only one who has tried to write about this. Over the centuries more than a few historians have tried to refute the slander. But in vain.</p><p>
“Now a situation has arisen where people who wish to touch God’s creations are being slandered in just the same way. There’s no small number of such people now, and they themselves are experiencing how their ancestors were lied about. The souls of the distant ancestors will rise up through those who are slandered today will taken up. Like guardian angels, those distant parents will begin to defend their children of today. There will be no kinder or lighter force than that now arising in the world. Believe. If this has occurred for people today… If an invisible thread is capable of reuniting today’s son with his parents who lived two thousand years ago. And if this thread of union stretches out still further, then today’s man will unite with God, with his first parent.”</p><p>
Grandfather said this, barely containing his excitement. But I wanted to be clear:</p><p>
“Maybe what you’ve said is very important. But look, the creation of family homesteads is being held up.”</p><p>
“But perhaps this hold up is necessary for the realization and co-creation of the future project?”</p><p>
“Perhaps. All of it is coming about in such an unusual way somehow. It’s as if the first book came out of some simple actions, and then the second, and readers’ clubs, and now we have ‘The Family Book’ and ‘The Family Chronicle.’</p><p>
At these words, Grandfather started laughing again, but then immediately stopped and said, smiling kindly:</p><p>
“Clearly my granddaughter was amusing herself with ‘The Family Chronicle.’ Maybe to comfort you somehow. Well, well, my granddaughter created a situation where the country’s highest leaders and the Patriarch came out in support of her idea. But only of one idea. While keeping silent about her philosophy, or not understanding it. They won’t make it into eternity. They’re just playing it safe. They’re not bold.</p><p>
“The ones who will enter into history and eternity are those who are creating their own homesteads that are pleasing to God right now, even in their thoughts. Whether they chose that idea themselves or they were chosen won’t matter anymore. Eternity lies ahead for those people who are creating a future for their children. For their children and for themselves. For the first time on Earth, man – who was born for eternity – shall return to eternity.</p><p>
“I’m beginning to understand my granddaughter’s deeds, Vladimir. It may be that much of the secrets of existence have been revealed to Anastasia. But there’s one thing that even the highest priests don’t fully know. All that they always knew was this: that human life can be eternal. And this partial knowledge enabled them to reincarnate. But their reincarnation was incomplete. And for that reason, neither their deeds, nor those of mankind, brought them joy. Now, I’m convinced – believe me – that Anastasia knows in full the creations necessary for attaining eternity. Ask her about this and try to comprehend. And if she finds within her the words that great numbers of people will comprehend, then worlds worthy of the man-god will open up.</p><p>
“Go, Vladimir, go to my granddaughter and talk with her. Right now she’s sitting on the bank of the lake, beneath the cedar tree. Sometime significant can take place in the world, when words about eternity are found that are comprehensible for the mind and the feelings. The aspirations of the great, awakened civilization will soar upward. The galaxy will sense the great aspirations and with reverent excitement await contact with those who can give a marvelous life to the planets. Go. Don’t dawdle.”</p><p>
I took a few steps, but a shout from Anastasia’s grandfather stopped me:</p><p>
“Vladimir, you know, maybe it’s time for you and you Anastasia-ites to form your own family party.”</p><p>
“A party? What kind?”</p><p>
“That’s what I’m saying, that’s what you should call it – ‘The Family Party.’”</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=chapter id=0813>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>13. The New Civilisation</p></h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div><p>
</p><p>
Anastasia was sitting beneath the cedar tree in a light gray linen dress. With her arms wrapped around her knees and her head tipped slightly downward, she was looking at the mirror-like surface of the lake. I didn’t go up to her right away. I stood there at a distance for some time, observing the hermit sitting quietly on the bank. No. That description doesn’t fit Anastasia. Really, it’s modern apartment-dwellers we should call hermits.</p><p>
A person lives in an apartment and he doesn’t even know the neighbors who share his landing. This kind of person walks along the street, and he has nothing to do with the people walking past him. Just as the people walking toward or alongside him have nothing to do with him as he walks.</p><p>
And this means it’s not a scary thing for a person to live alone. What’s a much scarier thing is when he’s alone among people just like him.</p><p>
And here Anastasia sits alone on the bank of a taiga lake, but her heart beats in unison with the hearts of millions of people living in various countries. One person calls her a friend, another a sister, as if they were relatives.</p><p>
And her softly uttered words pass gently through the endless stream of information that booms and shouts from the television screens and from a multitude of other sources. Her words pass through and people take them in. And those who hear these words answer with a guitar string and a song, and often with action. They build their lives in a new way. And Grandfather… This was the first time I’d seen him express himself so passionately, when he asked me to talk with Anastasia about eternity.</p><p>
When I sat down beside her, she turned toward me. The tender glance of her gray-blue eyes calmed me. For a while we just looked at each other.</p><p>
And I, as if I couldn’t help myself, took her hand, quickly kissed it and then placed it back on her knees. Anastasia blushed, and her eyelashes quivered. And some kind of embarrassment came over me, for no reason at all. How strange to feel embarrassed with a woman when you’ve known her for ten years! And how pleasant.</p><p>
To overcome the awkwardness of my embarrassment, I spoke first:</p><p>
“I was chatting with your grandfather just now, Anastasia. He was speaking in some unusual, excited way about the need for some words or other about eternity. He said they have to be the kind of words a person can understand not only with his mind or intellect, but with his feelings, too. Are these words actually important?”</p><p>
“Yes, Vladimir, they’re important. But it’s not the words – people’s awareness is important. And in order for it to arise, we of course need words. An awareness of eternal life will help make the image of man’s life perfect.”</p><p>
“But what kind of connection is there between an image of life and an awareness of eternity?”</p><p>
“A direct connection. Modern people think that they can live only a few decades before they leave life forever and head for nowhere. But man’s life can be eternal. It’s essential to speak about this, so that everyone understands that, or at least the majority of people.”</p><p>
“But you have spoken about this. And I’ve written your words in the various books.”</p><p>
“Yes, I have spoken about it, but evidently my speech was incomprehensible, or else the millennia have created a very powerful belief in the transitory nature of human existence. We have to find new words and arguments.”</p><p>
“Okay, so try to find them.”</p><p>
“I will try. Evidently we need to search for them together with those who will understand.”</p><p>
“But why don’t you try to come up with your own first.”</p><p>
“All right. Perhaps this is the way we have to say it…</p><p>
“The majority of people living on earth think that they themselves plan out their life. They choose a profession, create a family, bear children or, conversely, decline to have children. But their decisions are in many ways not independent. The will of others, acting through public opinion, exerts a great influence on them. For example, you have a certain object. It’s called a “clothes hanger.” One day someone decided to refine that object and use a person himself as a clothes hanger. And a profession called “model” appeared. This profession is an unenviable one, not in line with man’s life’s purpose.</p><p>
“But someone decided to make it one of the most appealing professions, and he succeeded. They began featuring live models in various color magazines and television shows and telling about their supposedly happy lives. Talking about how much money they earn and about how wealthy people want to marry them. Millions of young girls began dreaming of making themselves into the best model in the world and, consequently, making themselves happy.</p><p>
“Millions of young girls in various countries began doing everything possible to achieve this illusory glory. One out of a million became a famous model, while remaining in essence no more than a live clothes hanger. The rest were overcome by disappointment in life, since their dream did not become a reality.</p><p>
“And this happened because they were unable to determine their life’s purpose on their own, and instead began building their lives under the effect of someone else’s will.</p><p>
“I could give you a great many examples of how men, women and even children aspire to illusory values, all the while disregarding their life’s purpose.</p><p>
“On the whole, to what can a community of such people aspire? What’s your opinion, Vladimir?”</p><p>
“Well, it doesn’t aspire to anything, that community of people. Out there in our country, in Russia, not a single party, and not the government as a whole either, no one has any program at all for building the future. One thing that interests me in what you said, Anastasia, is determining a man’s life’s purpose. What is that purpose? How can we determine it?”</p><p>
“Let your thought, Vladimir, and the thought of other people try to comprehend God’s creation, His program and dream.”</p><p>
“But is it really possible – to comprehend God’s dream?”</p><p>
“It’s possible. After all, He has never hidden anything from people – his children. He didn’t write arcane texts. He showed everything in examples. And the first thing that each person needs to understand and feel is this: what deeds lead a person to eternity. Think about it yourself, Vladimir: why, after creating the diverse and living world, did God not create automobiles, televisions or rockets in today’s form?”</p><p>
“Maybe He simply didn’t manage to create it, but man did...?”</p><p>
“He created all that man needs: man has within him a means of conveyance and an imagination with which he can see pictures better than those drawn on a television screen. Man can also explore the planets without using primitive artificial projectiles.</p><p>
“He determined man’s life’s purpose and a program for developing the life of the entire Universe. In order to understand His program and not destroy it, it’s essential to study and determine the significance of everything on earth.”</p><p>
</p><p>************************</p><p>Immortality</p><p>************************</p><p>
</p><p>“God created man immortal, only for this to be, one must observe three conditions.</p><p>
“The first: create a living space that will draw a person to it and which a person will aspire to reach.</p><p>
“The second: there should be at least one person on Earth who thinks of you with kindness and love.</p><p>
“The third: never tolerate within you the thought that death can befall you, and this is very important. If even a person who’s falling asleep is persuaded that he is dying, and he himself believes this, then he will die, at the mercy of his thought. But if a person who’s actually elderly in the earthly sense exhausts his body and is lying on his deathbed, but doesn’t think about death, imagining instead his life in the living space he has created, then he will be reborn anew. Such is the law of the Universe. It cannot allow a life-creating thought to die.</p><p>
“You have the concept of natural selection. Just in that way now God’s program selects all the very best to be incarnated anew. However, the selection was not large. Now it is growing many times larger. Whosoever builds a family homestead will begin to incarnate again and again.</p><p>
“All that hinders them will disappear from the Earth for all time, giving way to a new, arising civilization.”</p><p>
“Why a new civilization, if it’s the same people and plants, the same planet?”</p><p>
“A new civilization, Vladimir, is characterized by a new awareness, by new perceptions of the surrounding world. This great beginning, arising in modern man and invisible to the ordinary eye, will start by changing the face of the entire planet called ‘Earth.’ It will affect the life of the whole Universe.”</p><p>
“But how can the Universe be changed by the face of the earth?”</p><p>
“It can, Vladimir. You see, our planet is a tiny part, but it interacts intimately with the other parts of the Universe. Maybe just the tiniest part changes, but through its changes it can affect the whole vast variety of the Universe.”</p><p>
“Yes, interesting. But could you show me a picture from the future, Anastasia, of how the Universe can change?”</p><p>
“I could. Here, look.”</p><div class=section><img src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/love-that-creates-worlds-vk.com-kumar82.jpg>
<h3>A Love That Creates Worlds</h3></div>
<p>Spring was coming into bloom on planet Yalmeza. Grasses resembling earth grasses, and flowers on the trees and bushes were scenting the air. Along the path amidst the spring magnificence, Vladislav was walking to the symposium. He would be giving a lecture about the origin of life on planet Yalmeza. His childhood friend Radomir would serve as his opponent.</p><p>
At the ripe age of nineteen, Vladislav possessed a broad enough volume of information to present his theory at any level of the academic board. But his friend Radomir’s knowledge was no less than his. Radomir and his group of supporters would exploit any weak point in the speech or any inadequate reasoning regarding past events. Liudmila would be at the symposium, too. Liudmila… It just so happened that both of them had loved this girl from the time they were children. They loved her, but they didn’t admit their love, not to each other and not to the girl, waiting instead for some kind of sign from Liudmila: which of them would she prefer?</p><p>
Vladislav took the long way there on purpose so he could think through his presentation one more time. But something kept him from concentrating. He had the feeling someone was watching him. And when he heard some rustling behind him, Vladislav turned around abruptly. Someone darted from the path into the bushes and froze in the grass. Vladislav took a few steps back in that direction and caught sight of his four-year old sister Katya hiding in the grass beneath the bushes.</p><p>
“So, Katerinka, once again you’re on my tail,” Vladislav said, addressing his sister affectionately. “Serious business awaits me. Don’t you understand that you might be disturbing me? Of course you understand. That’s why you’re hiding in the grass.”</p><p>
“I’m not hiding. I’m just lying here. I’m taking a look at a flower and some bugs,” little Katya informed him, making believe she really was interested in the little flower.</p><p>
“Ah, I see. Okay then, keep lying there and looking. But I’m going on ahead.”</p><p>
Katya immediately jumped up, ran up to Vladislav and quickly said:</p><p>
“You go on ahead, Vladichek. I’ll walk behind you, quiet as a mouse, so I won’t disturb your thinking. When we get to where all the people have gathered, you take my hand, so everyone can see what a handsome and smart brother I have.”</p><p>
“Well, okay. Don’t sweet-talk me. Give me your hand. But remember: when I or someone else is giving a speech, don’t even think of commenting on what the adults have said, the way you did last time.”</p><p>
Satisfied, Katerinka grabbed Vladik by the hand and promised:</p><p>
“Vladichek, I’ll try with all my might not to comment.”</p><p>
</p><p>Elderly and young representatives of carious regions of planet Yalmeza were filling up the outdoor amphitheater. No one had pens or pads or anything at all to write with. Their natural memory made it possible for them to remember all that was said, down to the tiniest details. Nor did Vladislav, who had stepped out before the audience, have any props. With the power of his mind he could construct holograms in space that would show any pictures of the past and produce everyday items and even feelings.</p><p>
A bit nervous, Vladislav began his lecture:</p><p>
“The planet on which we live is called Yalmeza. Its age is more than ninety trilliard years. But life appeared on it only three hundred years ago. We are obliged for the appearance of life to our ancestors, two residents of planet Earth. Or, to be more precise, the appearance of life on planet Yalmeza occurred under the influence of the energy of love and the dream of two inhabitants of planet Earth. For this reason I will present historical information about the life of the earthlings.</p><p>
“The initial period of life for the people of Earth might well have been the same as ours. They knew and sensed both their planet and the life’s purpose of the Universe well.</p><p>
“The earthlings ascertained the life’s purpose of all living organisms of their planet and made skillful use of them.</p><p>
“But one day a catastrophe occurred. A virus invaded the consciousness of one of the Earth’s inhabitants, a virus that began to spread aggressively among the planet’s other inhabitants. Our scientists have named this virus using the word ‘death.’ The outer signs of this virus, as historical data attest, consist of the following symptoms. People attacked by it begin to destroy the living, perfect diversity of the planet, constructing in its place a primitive, artificial world. Earthlings themselves called this period of life the technocratic period.</p><p>
“People attacked by the ‘death’ virus began changing from rational beings into irrational beings. They flocked together in large numbers on small plots of land and built dwellings for themselves that looked like stone crypts stacked one atop the other.</p><p>
“Imagine a stone mountain with a multitude of hollows bored into it. These are roughly the kind of stone mountains that people built with their own two hands and called houses. They called these hollow-crypts in the artificial mountains apartments. They called a large cluster of these artificial stone mountains with the crypts adjoining each other cities.</p><p>
“In these so-called cities there was air that wasn’t fit to breathe and water not fit to drink, and stale food. Separate organs of the human being would begin to rot and decay while the organism was still alive. Of course, it’s difficult to imagine a moving human body, inside which the organs are rotting and decaying. But that’s the way it was.</p><p>
“Historical sources attest to the fact that people of the technocratic age even had a science called medicine. They considered the greatest achievement of this science the ability to replace internal organs. People didn’t understand that the very existence of such a science indicated the inadequacy of their consciousness.</p><p>
“But it wasn’t just people’s flesh that was decaying. Their consciousness was swiftly degrading, and their intellect. Their thought slowed down, and they even began losing the ability to count and invented the calculator. They lost the ability to construct holograms in space, and invented the television – that’s a kind of primitive device that shows something resembling a hologram.</p><p>
“Once they’d lost the ability to move through space, they began constructing artificial apparatuses and called them automobiles, airplanes and rockets.</p><p>
“From time to time, various groups of people would attack others and kill each other. But the most unbelievable thing is that the ‘death’ virus made people believe that they were not eternal, but only temporary in their perceived space they.</p><p>
“More and more, the acts of people in the technocratic period turned planet Earth into a foul-smelling spot in the Universe, reeking of fumes. But the Universal Intelligence didn’t destroy this noxious spot, but instead kept waiting for something.”</p><p>
Interrupting Vladislav’s lecture, a voice rang out from within the group of opponents headed by Vladislav’s friend Radomir. “Stop for a minute, please. There’s no point in continuing your speech. Something like that could not have happened on Earth.”</p><p>
“All right, I’ll stop my lecture if you really can prove the implausibility of what I’ve said.”</p><p>
A young man rose from among the group of opponents and announced the following:</p><p>
“We have authoritative evidence that religion existed within the community of earthlings. The religious tracts told of how the Earth and everything growing on it was created by the Universal Intelligence – they called it God. They would worship him and perform a great number of rites in his name. I hope, esteemed lecturer, that you won’t deny that fact?”</p><p>
“No, I won’t,” replied Vladislav.</p><p>
“Then tell me, how can one perform rites in honor of one’s god and simultaneously destroy his creations? It’s impossible to do both at the same time. Consequently, thickly settled cities could have existed on Earth. People could not have polluted the water created by the God they revered. And besides, the Universal Intelligence could not have allowed that kind of bacchanal. Otherwise we can’t even call it intelligence. Quite the opposite – we’d have to call into question the intelligence of what has been created by it, of man first of all. What do you have to say to that, esteemed lecturer?”</p><p>
“I’ll say that the existence of Intelligence, especially Universal Intelligence, is the unity of two great sources – Intelligence and Anti-Intelligence.</p><p>
“The Anti-intelligent period of life for the people of planet Earth was necessary. And if you’ll permit me, in my subsequent remarks I’ll prove that two great sources exist in man.”</p><p>
“All right. Continue,” the young man assented and then took his seat.</p><p>
“The Universal World is a union of opposites,” Vladislav continued confidently. “And man also reflects this union of opposites in himself. Within the unbelievable chaos that befell the people of Earth, there suddenly arose people who were able to understand… These people changed their relationship to earthly creations, not in words and not with the help of religious treatises. They began changing their way of life. They themselves didn’t yet fully comprehend the scale of their creation, and they called their actions simply ‘building a family homestead.’</p><p>
“They didn’t yet know, that by touching the earth with a new awareness they were beginning to revive the planets of the Universe. That death would not exist for them. That their descendants would call the children they bore gods. They were simply building their family homesteads on the planet Earth. The Universal Intelligence followed their actions with bated breath and wonder. And there came a time when all the people of the Earth began to live on their beautiful homesteads. And there came a day when… Look. I’ll show you a hologram. You’ll see two people in it.”</p><p>
In the space in front of the audience arose an earth landscape. Two elderly people, a man and a woman, were walking hand in hand along a path that led from their homestead to the forest. They were clearly more than a hundred years old. Evening was falling and stars, as yet barely visible, were appearing in the sky. The people walked up to a cedar tree, and the elderly woman leaned her back against it.</p><p>
“I’m a grandmother and a great-grandmother, and you still keep asking me to walk beneath the starry sky, just like when we were young,” the woman said, tenderly addressing her companion.</p><p>
“But don’t you want to do that, too?”</p><p>
“Of course I do, my love.”</p><p>
He took hold of her shoulders, embraced her impulsively, and kissed her on the lips.</p><p>
Then, pulling the shoulder strap of her dress to the side, he revealed her shoulder. In the moonlight, three moles, all in a row, were clearly visible on the woman’s left shoulder. The man kissed each one of them.</p><p>
“You’re just the same as you were, my love, and I don’t want to part from you.”</p><p>
“And we won’t part. We’ll die and be born anew.”</p><p>
“We can’t be reborn,” she said sadly. “Look, there’s less and less open land on Earth all the time, there are gardens and homesteads all around, and there may not be enough room for our grandchildren. Most likely, the Creator miscalculated somehow when he was creating our Earth.”</p><p>
“I don’t think so. There’s some way out. We just don’t know what it is yet. But I’m certain, that our love cannot be severed. You and I will die so that we can be born anew.”</p><p>
“But where?”</p><p>
“Look, my love, on that star. May our thought create life that resembles life here on earth, on a new planet. Think about it – why did it occur to Him to create so many planets? It wasn’t for no reason. Our thought is material, and it will create for us life on a lifeless planet. We will materialize again and again. Our love…”</p><p>
“Thank you for the beautiful dream, my love. With you… I will help you give birth to life on the new planet.”</p><p>
“My love, what shall we call the planet of our new life?”</p><p>
“Yalmeza. Let that be called that.”</p><p>
“Yalmeza, wait for us, and while you’re waiting, burst into bloom with gardens, cover yourself with grasses, just as I wish,” the man pronounced, confidently and passionately.</p><p>
“And as I, too, wish,” she answered.</p><p>
The hologram disappeared. Vladislav bowed to the audience and stepped off to the side, ceding his spot to his friend and opponent Radomir.</p><p>
Radomir took Vladislav’s spot, cast a glance over the audience and began to speak:</p><p>
“I must oppose my friend. And I’ll say straight away: there is much in his theory that’s unproven and even contradictory. Like my friends, I can’t believe that this absolutely absurd period in the life of people existed.</p><p>
“The hologram he showed, as we all understand, is the will of his thought, of his imagination, and it demands confirmation. Although this hologram did produce some kind of strange sensation in me. It seemed to me that my friend took it from among stories we already know, only I can’t recall what its source is.”</p><p>
A murmur passed through the amphitheater, and exclamations were heard:</p><p>
“Could he really have plagiarized it? Unheard of! But perhaps the lecturer didn’t know…”</p><p>
“Plagiarism. I definitely had the feeling it was something I’d seen before.”</p><p>
Vladislav lowered his head and stood off to the side. He winced when he heard a child’s cry from the far rows of the seated people. “A-a-a…a-a-a-a.” It was his irrepressible sister Ekaterinka shouting.</p><p>
“It’s good that she’s just shouting and not commenting on what’s going on,” thought Vladislav. But he was mistaken.</p><p>
Waiting until silence had fallen, Ekaterina loudly announced:</p><p>
“Don’t even dare to argue with my brother. Because he’s very smart and sensitive.”</p><p>
“Yes, that’s a weighty argument,” rang out some snickers.</p><p>
“That’s correct, very weighty,” continued little Ekaterinka. “And you, Radomirchik, stop staring at Liudmila. Don’t stare, and that’s it.”</p><p>
“Katya, be quiet,” shouted Vladislav.</p><p>
“I won’t be quiet. Liudmilka loves you, and you love her. I know for sure.”</p><p>
“Katya!” Vladislav shouted once more and then headed toward his sister.</p><p>
“Liudmila, why are you just sitting there?” exclaimed Katya. “Stop him. He won’t let me have my say. He’s going to drag me away now. By force.”</p><p>
A brown-haired girl stood up from the farthest row, went toward Vladislav and barred his path. Liudmila’s cheeks were burning red. Lowering her head, she whispered:</p><p>
“Your sister is right, Vladislav.”</p><p>
The hushed audience heard her whisper. The heads of those in attendance turned to little Ekaterinka, and people smiled at her and applauded. Inspired by the audience’s support, the little girl ran to Radomir who stood before the hall, took her spot beside him and held her little hands aloft, quieting the hall with her gesture.</p><p>
When everyone had fallen silent, she began speaking once again, addressing Radomir:</p><p>
“And you, Radomirchik, you were just about to become a traitor. Don’t criticize my brother. He showed everything correctly. He’s your friend. You’re his friend. And don’t criticize him.”</p><p>
Radomir condescendingly looked down at the little girl from above and, addressing both her and those sitting in the amphitheater just as condescendingly, he said:</p><p>
“I’m not criticizing. I’m simply stating a fact. There’s not enough proof for the hologram he showed. There’s not a single bit of proof.”</p><p>
“There is one. Or even two,” Katerinka announced firmly.</p><p>
“And where might it be, or they, if there are two?”</p><p>
“One of them – that’s me. The second – that’s you, Radomir,” the little girl said confidently.</p><p>
At these words, she undid two little buttons on her dress and revealed her little shoulder. On little Ekaterinka’s left shoulder, Radomir glimpsed three moles that were just like the ones the elderly earth woman shown in the hologram had. Radomir took a close look at the moles on shoulder of the little girl, and the blood began pulsing more and more strongly in his veins. He made an effort to remember. Before him appeared a hologram that he alone could see.</p><p>
An earth landscape. He kisses the three moles on the shoulder of his beloved. Then she embraces him. Laughing, she tousles his hair and as always, kisses the tip of his nose, laughing.</p><p>
The hologram disappeared.</p><p>
Radomir looked a bit longer at Ekaterinka, who was standing before him, her shoulder still bare. Then he quickly leaned over, picked the little girl up in his arms and pressed her to him. She embraced him and, laughing, tousled his hair and quickly kissed the tip of his nose. He held little Ekaterinka in his arms, and she whispered in his ear:</p><p>
“You were in too much of a hurry, Radomirchik, or maybe I was born a bit too late. Now, wait until I grow up. Wait for fourteen years. You won’t be happy with any other girls: I’m your other half.”</p><p>
“I’ll wait for you to grow up, my love,” the young man quietly answered.</p><p>
Worn out from the excitement, and calm now, Ekaterinka rested her head on Radomir’s shoulder and fell into a sweet sleep, but he silently stood before the hushed audience and carefully held his future wife in his arms.</p><p>
He was mentally writing letters in space. Those gathered there read the text of the hologram he’d created: “Proof exists. It is within each of us! Endless and eternal is love in the Universe.”</p><p>
Then, slowly and gently, so as to not awaken the little girl asleep on his shoulder, Radomir made his way toward the exit.</p><p>
He forgot to disconnect his thought from space, and the hologram continued to fill up with letters. Those gathered there understood that these words weren’t addressed to them, but they couldn’t help reading them:</p><p>
“You ran barefoot amongst the stars. You didn’t seek love for yourself. All on your own, in the expanses of the Universe, you preserved what we must preserve together.”</p><p>
Words intended for the little girl of the planet Yalmeza and the earth woman – the goddess who had given life to their planet.</p><p>
The little goddess slept sweetly on Radomir’s shoulder and perhaps, in her sleep, she also heard the words of her beloved.</p><p>
</p><p>“It’s great, Anastasia! That means, once people have developed the entire Earth according to the Divine program, they’ll be able to move to other planets?”</p><p>
“Of course. Otherwise the very existence of the planets of the Universe is meaningless. But He has granted great meaning to everything. The love of two people, the dream born of love, is capable of breathing life into any planet.”</p><p>
“And what’s more, if I understood you correctly, people who are building homesteads now won’t die. They’ll just change bodies and immediately incarnate in life.”</p><p>
“Of course, it’s their acts on earth that are most needed of all. They are pleasing to God. And even those people who haven’t yet managed to touch the ground with their hands, but who have begun building their future, beautiful, living, heavenly corner in their thoughts, are many times more necessary to the Divine program than hundreds of wise men who have fenced themselves off from God’s creations behind stone walls and talk about God and about spirituality.</p><p>
“Their discourses are blasphemous and sad, and death without incarnation awaits them. Their fate is terrible, but it is not God’s punishment, but their very own choice for their fate!</p><p>
“He shone in the Universe through a new idea – it is a great energy, but a judge, too. In treatises and legends much has been said about Divine Judgment. Divine Judgment arrived, silent and invisible. It will touch all people now living on the planet. And each one himself will be his own judge.</p><p>
“Whoever chooses life and creates a living life – he will be eternal and in the likeness of the great Creator of the Universe.</p><p>
“Whoever who models death in his imagination – he will be doomed to death by his very thought.”</p><p>
It was as if these words of hers, pronounced on the bank of the river in a calm and confident tone of voice, seized the space the way an echo moves across the land. In ten years not I alone had come to know how capable was Anastasia of modeling the future with her thoughts and with her words.</p><p>
</p><p>I was sailing away off along the river. She was standing on the shore. Over and over again, the space repeated her words about the life eternal. From what worlds of the Universe, I suddenly thought, or from what galaxies had Anastasia, standing on the shore in her earthly form, appeared and given to the planet called “Earth” awareness of eternity? She doesn’t throw words around lightly. And life confirms this.</p><p>
And if it is so, then I must congratulate you, my readers. And I congratulate you on your awareness! Creating life in the Universe, we shall live eternally.</p><p>
Until our next joyful meeting, my friends!</p><p class=tbc>

Love is a Cosmic Entity</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>A person suddenly popped up on the road somehow. He was standing practically in the middle of the travel lane, his back to the approaching Jeep. I immediately started slowing down, so I could carefully drive around the strange, gray-haired person.</p><p>When I was only about ten meters from him, the old man calmly turned toward me. Without even intending to, I put on the brakes.</p><p>Standing before me on the road was Anastasia’s grandfather. I recognized him right away. His gray hair and beard didn’t fit at all with his sparkling, young eyes, and this incongruity immediately distinguished the old man from many elderly people. And I was also quite familiar with the long gray raincoat of unidentifiable fabric and non-descript cut. Nonetheless, I couldn’t believe my eyes. How in the world could this old man from the Siberian taiga have ended up here, in the middle of Russia, on a road leading from the city of Vladimir to the city of Suzdal? How? On what post-chaises? How could the Siberian hermit easily navigate the maze of our transportation system? After all, he didn’t have any papers at all.</p><p>He could certainly get hold of some money by selling dried mushrooms and cedar nuts, as his granddaughter Anastasia did. But without papers…</p><p>Of course, many of our homeless people don’t have papers, and the police can’t do anything about that. But Anastasia’s grandfather doesn’t look much like a homeless person.</p><p>He wears his old threadbare clothes, of course, but they are always clean, and he has a rather well-groomed appearance – his face is bright, and there’s a bit of color in his cheeks.</p><p>And so I sat there, motionless behind the wheel of the Jeep. He approached the car on his own, and I opened the door for him.</p><p>“Hi, Vladimir. Are you headed to Suzdal? Can you take me there?” the old man asked matter-of-factly.</p><p>“Well, of course I’ll take you there. Have a seat. How did you end up here? How did you get here from the taiga?”</p><p>“How I got here is unimportant. What’s important is why.”</p><p>“Well, why?”</p><p>“To take a tour of real Russian history with you and also to clear away your hard feelings toward me. I’m doing my granddaughter Anastasia’s bidding. She said, ‘It’s you who’s at fault for the hard feelings, Grandpa.’ And so I’m going on a tour with you. That’s why you’re headed to Suzdal, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes, I want to visit a museum. And I really did have hard feelings, but they’ve passed.”</p><p>We rode along for a bit in silence. I recalled how cold my parting with Anastasia’s grandfather in the taiga had been. We hadn’t even said goodbye to each other. And what had happened was this.</p><p>Anastasia’s grandfather had advised me to form a party and suggested calling it the “Family Party.”</p><p>Actually, various people had proposed forming a party founded on Anastasia’s ideas long before that.</p><p>Many people thought we needed a party to make it easier for people to get land for building family homesteads and to protect them in the future from all manner of bureaucratic challenges, since, I’m very sorry to say, no existing party was working on these questions.</p><p>Because certain forces are putting up opposition to Anastasia’s ideas, trying in every possible way to discredit the actual ideas, the people with whom they’ve resonated, me, and Anastasia, it’s been proposed that we create a party, but without focusing in the charter’s “Ideas and Objectives” section on the question of how to create favorable conditions for establishing family homesteads. And it’s been proposed that we not even mention Anastasia’s ideas and the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” book series at all.</p><p>People have assured me that if we don’t do this, the party won’t get registered. And so I decided to discuss this question with Anastasia’s grandfather and also ask him for advice regarding the party’s structures, primary goals and objectives. I figured that since he was well-versed in the deeds of the priests who were continually creating all manner of social organizations and religions that have existed for more than a millennium, he’d probably also be in the know about the secret organizational principles that helped make these structures so enduring.</p><p>Besides, he himself was no mean priest. Possibly even a bit more powerful than those who now rule the world. And if that’s the case, then he must know the principles that guided the creation of even the priests’ organization, which ended up being more enduring than religions.</p><p>In fact, the priests’ organization – a supra religious entity – existed and exists even now, since the priests participated directly in the creation of several religions and secular organizations. This is clear from the history of Ancient Egypt and other countries.</p><p>Consequently, Anastasia’s grandfather would be able to lay the foundation for certain principles of the “Family Party,” thereby making it a most powerful organization, perhaps even the most powerful.</p><p>I was sincere about wanting to hear his advice, and so, seizing a moment when he seemed to me not to be lost in his own thoughts, I began speaking to him:</p><p>“You know, you were talking about a party. Readers have been talking about it for a long time, too. But some people propose that we not mention Anastasia, her ideas, or the books in its charter. So the registration will go through without a hitch.”</p><p>The gray-haired old man stood before me, leaning on his fatherly staff, and kept silent. He didn’t simply keep silent – he was scrutinizing me intently, as if seeing me for the first time. His glance was not very kind somehow, but rather critical.</p><p>And when he did begin speaking, after a long pause, I also sensed a note of condescension in his voice:</p><p>“Registration, you say. Advice, so that’s what you’ve come to ask for? Whether to betray or not betray?”</p><p>“What’s betrayal got to do with it? I’ve come to ask your advice about how to proceed, so the party registration will go through without a hitch.”</p><p>“You know, the registration is not a goal in and of itself, and neither is the party a goal in and of itself. Without the ideas, you say? Without any mention? But then how will the readers know that it’s their family party? And not the party of materialistic traitors? People have proposed that you make some kind of senseless organization – without the foundation, without the idea, without the symbols that have already helped predetermine it will dominate for centuries to come. And you’ve come to ask me whether it’s worth following their advice. You couldn’t deal with this simplest stumbling block on your own?”</p><p>I realized I’d gotten myself into a somewhat idiotic situation, and in an attempt to get out of it, I asked a different question:</p><p>“Basically, I’d like to find out how you recommend we lay the foundation for the principles when we’re organizing the party structure, its goals and objectives.”</p><p>What happened next just pushed me over the edge. As it seemed to me then, it wasn’t just that the elder wouldn’t answer my questions – he began arrogantly mocking me. First he looked at me in amazement, snorted in some irritated tone and turned away from me. He even took a step away from me. But then he did turn back to me and said:</p><p>“Vladimir, how can you not understand that all the answers to the questions you’ve posed need to be born within you yourself and within each person who decides to build that entity along with you? I can give you a hint, of course. And tomorrow will bring another hint, and a third after that, and you won’t be taking action, but just following the hints. You’ll move to the right, then to the left, and after advancing, you’ll come back again or suddenly start wandering around in circles because your mind is lazy.”</p><p>Well, that phrase “because your mind is lazy” offended me greatly. Since my first meeting with Anastasia, I’ve been straining that mind of mine – for far more than a year now – both during the day and when I go to sleep. Maybe it was starting to get overheated from the constant strenuous work. I’d written eight books and had myself reflected on what was written in them. Sometimes I’d check the meaning of separate phrases several times for accuracy. And the old man was well aware of this.</p><p>My resentment was beginning to flare up, but even so, restraining myself, I explained:</p><p>“Well, it’s as if everyone thinks and reflects, and various organizations get created: communist ones, democratic, centrist. But as one person said, ‘No matter what party we create, we still end up with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.’”</p><p>“Well said. And that’s exactly what I’m telling you: you’re wandering around in circles because your mind is lazy.”</p><p>“But what does my mind being lazy have to do with it? Maybe I just don’t have enough information?”</p><p>“So, that means you don’t have enough information and you’ve come to me to get it. But are you capable of comprehending things with a mind that’s grown lazy?”</p><p>My resentment kept growing, but, restraining my annoyance, I answered:</p><p>“Well, okay, I’ll give it a try. I’ll strain my brain.”</p><p>“Then pay attention. The entity needs to resemble the Novgorod veche in its early period. And you’ll come to understand more later.”</p><p>That kind of answer even made me angry. The old man knew full well that historical documents about Russia in the pre-Christian period are nowhere to be found – they were destroyed. Consequently, how that Novgorod veche worked, and in its early period to boot – no one could ever say. Which meant he was mocking me. But why? What had I done to him to make him treat me that way… Trying to speak in a calm voice, out of respect for his age, I said:</p><p>“Excuse me for disturbing you. You were probably in the middle of some kind of important work. I’ll be going.”</p><p>And I turned to go, but he called</p><p> out after me:</p><p>“And the goal or objective of the ‘Family Party’ should be to create the conditions for bringing the energy of Love back into families. It’s essential to bring back the rites and holidays that are capable of helping people seek out their soul mates.”</p><p>“What?” I turned to the old man once again. “Love? Into families? I get it that you don’t want to talk about meaningful things with me. But why do you mock me?”</p><p>“I’m not mocking, Vladimir. It’s you who is incapable of understanding: if you don’t learn to think on your own, then it will take years to make you understand.”</p><p>“To make me understand what? Do you have even the vaguest idea what kind of goals and objectives all the world’s parties write in their charters?”</p><p>“I have a vague idea.”</p><p>“And so tell me. If you do, well, tell me.”</p><p>“They promise people that they will most certainly improve everyone’s well-being and introduce more freedom for people.”</p><p>“Exactly right. And specifically: that they’ll develop industry, provide people with apartments and stave off inflation.”</p><p>“Utter nonsense,” the old man snorted.</p><p>“Nonsense? Well, it will be nonsense if I take your advice and introduce this article into the party’s charter as a fundamental objective: ‘The Party will address the question of how each person can seek out his soul mate.’”</p><p>“And you can also add, ‘The Party will return to the people a way of life and rites that are capable of preserving love within families for all eternity.’”</p><p>“What are you talking about?! You… Do you want to make me a laughing stock for people? Various marriage agencies deal with these questions and with seeking out all kinds of mates – they make a business out of it. With those kinds of goals and objectives, you’ll end up with a marriage agency, not a party. And love in the family – that’s a family’s personal business, and no one, no party, has the right to interfere in family business. It’s not a state matter.”</p><p>“But really, doesn’t your state consist of families? And really, aren’t families the foundation of any state?”</p><p>“They are, they are, so the state should improve the well-being of families and separate citizens.”</p><p>“And tell me, will you bring love back to the majority of families by improving well-being in the country?”</p><p>“I don’t know. But you know it’s customary to think that all states should be concerned with their citizens’ well-being.”</p><p>“Vladimir, give some thought to the meaning of the word ‘well-being.’ Calmly consider its meaning. Now I’m going to pronounce this word a little bit differently: well being. Or a state of wellness. Think and understand: love alone is capable of raising any person’s wellness to the highest point. Not money, not palaces, but only the feeling given to man by the Creator – the state of love.</p><p>“Love is a cosmic entity. Living, thinking, with a high order of intelligence. It is powerful, and there’s a reason God delighted in it and presented man with the gift of its great energy. It’s essential to try to comprehend love, and to not shy away from giving it attention on the state level, too.</p><p>“And a state that consists of a multitude of families giving birth to children in love and creating a space of Love won’t suffer from inflation or from organized crime. It, such a state, has no need to combat vices – they’ll vanish from society. And all the prophets that cunningly philosophize will fall silent. Whether they failed to touch upon what was most important out of thoughtlessness, or because they didn’t know, is unimportant, but they have led people away from what’s most important to where there is no love.</p><p>“The priests knew about this and that is why they indulged the prophets.</p><p>“For centuries, mankind created rites to help in life and love. Whether the Creator guided people to these rites, or whether folk wisdom led them to the highest point is unimportant. Over the centuries they really did create well being and helped young couples attain love and joy for life for all time. Each rite was not like some occult superstition, as is the case now. It was a higher school, a Universal exam.</p><p>“The Vedic Russian wedding rite from time immemorial was imparted to you by Anastasia. You introduced it in but one of your books, but it is worthy of being mentioned in each book. You and those now living have not yet fully grasped it.</p><p>“Look: she also told you about ancient methods of seeking out the beloved. But they, too, have not been fully grasped by you. My granddaughter said, ‘Evidently I created images that were not strong.’ She places all the blame on herself, but I say that the blame lies in your – your own or your collective – lazy minds.</p><p>“Let the best learned men analyze the Vedic Russian wedding rite letter by letter. And they will not find – believe me, Vladimir – they will not find in it a single occult or superstitious act. It is a rational and precise rite for creating love. By contrast with it, you’ll see the absurdity, occultism and superstitions of contemporary celebrations. You need to understand: Anastasia knows immeasurably more than she tells you. Her acts and the logic of her actions are not immediately understood even by priests. They are only astonished afterwards by what my granddaughter has created.</p><p>“Ask her, and inspire her with your question. Ask: what kind of rite did the Vedic Russians have for giving birth to children?</p><p>“She won’t tell you about this on her own. She thinks she should speak only of that which you consider interesting. But you do not know what kind of great wisdom of the ages is hidden in the ancient rites. They are the creation of cosmic worlds.</p><p>“A people that has forgotten the centuries-old wisdom of its forebears may be worthy of being scorned. And by the way, it’s not important whether each individual person forgotten on his own or under the influence of priests who mastered the occult sciences.</p><p>“Ask, and inspire my granddaughter with your question. And find a way to stir a party to create love. But for the time being, you interest me little. I have to spend quite a long time explaining things to you that are already entirely obvious. Forgive an old man. It’s not good for me to speak and think of unpleasant things.”</p><p>The old man turned and began slowly walking away. I stood there alone in the taiga, as if I’d been spat upon. The resentment that had arisen at the very beginning of my discussion with him made it impossible for me to fully grasp all he’d said. But later, once I’d already gotten back home, I often returned in my thoughts to that conversation in the taiga, reflected and analyzed. I really wanted to prove – and perhaps not so much to Anastasia’s grandfather as to myself – that my mind was not entirely lazy.</p><p>I wanted to either disprove what he’d said, or confirm it.</p><p>The old man in the taiga said that as long as people only listen to hints and don’t start thinking for themselves about the essence of life, society won’t be able to make its way out of the succession of social cataclysms. And man will not be happy.</p><p>It seems that really is the way it is.</p><p>He also talked about how a certain program exists, God’s program. What exactly is that? To what extent does the life of contemporary man correspond to this plan?</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.202>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>2. Does our Life Correspond to the Divine Program?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>A person was born on the second floor in a maternity ward operating room. To the doctors’ amazement, the infant turned out to be absolutely healthy.</p><p>Days and months flew by like seconds, and the little one went to kindergarten, to school, to college. “Wise” teachers, pedagogues and professors installed a certain life’s program in him.</p><p>The person decided that the most important thing in life was to have lots of money, which would allow him to eat well and have an apartment, a car, and clothing. And he tried to work a lot, sometimes even working two shifts.</p><p>Meanwhile, seconds turned into years, and by the timed he worked his way up to retirement, he’d earned enough money to acquire a two-room apartment and a used car.</p><p>Before he reached retirement he fell in love, too, got married, got divorced and got married once again. He had a child with his first wife, but this child stayed with his mother after the divorce. He had a child with the second wife, but that child left and went far away to the North and would call him once or twice a year. The seconds of the years of his old age were ticking away. The person was sick and died. Such is the sad lot of the majority of people living on Earth.</p><p>A small number, of people, a minority, manage to become famous performers, politicians, presidents and millionaires. It’s generally thought that the lives of people in this category are the happiest, but this is an illusion. They have no fewer cares than everyone else, and their end is absolutely identical: old age, illness and death. Can the Divine program really have laid out such a fate for people living on Earth? No!</p><p>The Creator could not have preordained such a cruel and sad fate for his children.</p><p>It was human society itself that, under the influence of certain forces, ignored the Divine program and stepped onto the path of self-destruction and self-torture.</p><p>Some might doubt the existence of a Divine program for people’s lives. After all, scientists and politicians don’t speak of it.</p><p>Religions explain God’s intent, but always through go-betweens and often in varying ways. They agree only about the fact that God exists.</p><p>Philosophers and many scientists believe in the existence of a higher, rational, intelligent entity that created the world and the earthly life we see. And it’s impossible not to believe in this. All that exists in our world is just too sensibly interconnected. And if that’s the case, then the highly intelligent entity could have created only with intention.</p><p> It could have created only the eternal, foreordaining joyful prospects for all, first and foremost for his beloved man, who is like unto himself. In other words, man has been offered a specific way of life on Earth that enables him to come to know himself and the entire universe. To come to know and continue to fulfill the Divine program as he weaves his own beautiful creations into it. What God wants from his son-man is co-creation and joy for all who behold it.</p><p>There’s no doubt that God’s program exists, and not only a few, select people can acquaint themselves with it, but every person who wishes to do so. The Divine program is laid out not in letters or in hieroglyphs on papyrus sheets, but in the living symbols used by God himself alone, symbols of the nature He created.</p><p>And the mind and intelligence of people of the Old Russian period enabled them to read this great Divine book. Today’s people, for the most part, are familiar only with a few of the billions of these symbol-letters, and we will have to begin to learn the Divine alphabet anew.</p><p>The book I am now writing is not religious in nature. It is not an attempt to philosophize. This book is a call to investigate, to come to know the Divine program.</p><p>I don’t intend to tell someone how to live or to proselytize something. I just want to acquaint my readers with information about our forbears’ culture through the rites devised by the sages, rites intended to preserve love in families. And I want to encourage everyone to correct or confirm the conclusions I’ve drawn.</p><p>I was prompted to publish the given material by the remarks and logical inferences of the taiga hermits – first and foremost, by Anastasia.</p><p>The publication is necessary so we can sense the information through our own feelings and begin making joint efforts to act in accord with the logic of life. And with the hope that our generation will begin to reflect and will speed up the construction of a new civilization for us and our children.</p><p>It may be that Anastasia has conceptually laid out just the first point of the program for mankind’s development, and this first point is as follows: “The human community needs to master the Divine program using the material God has presented and transform the entire planet into a beautiful heavenly oasis. And create a harmoniously balanced community of all living beings. When such a stage of life is attained, the capacity for creating life on other planets and in other galaxies will open up within man.”</p><p>Bearing in mind this so very grand conception, Anastasia suggested we start out by building family homesteads.</p><p>And let us, too, begin our investigation with some commonly known and outwardly simple problems.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.203>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>3. Why does Love come and go?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Ah, how many poems and philosophical treatises have been devoted to this feeling! It’s hard to find a work of literature that doesn’t touch on this topic to some degree. Almost all religions speak of love. It’s thought that this great feeling was given to man by God.</p><p>But the reality of today’s human existence shows that the feeling of love is the most sadistic phenomenon.</p><p>Let’s take an honest look at things. Statistics show that 60-70% of marriages collapse. The collapse is preceded by years of two people living an absurd life, people who used to be in love. These years sometimes flow along accompanied by mutual insults, scandals and even physical violence.</p><p>The original, beautiful, inspired feeling of love departs and is replaced with years of ill-will, insults, hatred and in the end – unhappy children.</p><p>Such is the sad result of today’s love.</p><p>Can we consider such a result a gift from God? Not at all!</p><p>But perhaps it’s we ourselves who turn away from a certain way of life intrinsic to man, and that’s why love departs, its very departure serving as a sign for us: “I can’t live in such conditions. Your way of life is killing me. And you yourselves are dying.”</p><p>Returning in my thoughts to the conversation in the taiga, I recalled how unusually the gray-haired hermit had spoken of love: “Love is the most powerful cosmic energy. It is not unthinking. It possesses thoughts and its own feelings. Love is a living, self-sufficient entity, a living being.</p><p>“It has been sent to Earth through God’s will and is prepared to make a gift of its great energy to each person living on Earth and make his life in love eternal.</p><p>“It comes to each one in an attempt to tell of the Divine program in the language of feelings and, if a person doesn’t heed it, it has to leave, not by its own choice, but by the person’s.”</p><p>Love! A mysterious emotion and, despite the fact that nearly every person who has ever lived on Earth has had occasion to experience it, an unstudied one.</p><p>On the one hand, the majority of works of prose and poetry and the majority of genres of art touch on the topic of love. On the other hand, all the information in them simply confirms that such a phenomenon as love exists, and the most they provide is a description of its outward manifestations and the various ways people behave under the influence of the feeling that arises within them.</p><p>But is it really so necessary to study the feeling of love, this feeling so familiar to everyone?</p><p>The unusual information I received in the Siberian taiga, information I’d not encountered anywhere before, confirms that research is highly essential. It is essential to learn to understand love.</p><p>I think that one of the truest answers to the question of why love departs will be the simple answer: it departs when it doesn’t encounter understanding.</p><p>But people in the past understood it.</p><p>Judge for yourself: more than ten thousand years ago, the Vedic Russians possessed knowledge that helped them perform acts that strengthened love and, what’s more, rendered it eternal. One of these acts was the Ancient Vedic rite of marriage. After I published it in one of my books, many researchers began coming around to my assertion that the given rite could transform a feeling that started out as an ignited blaze into an eternal feeling. When I compared it to the rites of a variety of past and present day peoples, I became more and more convinced of this idea: the Ancient Vedic right of marriage is a practical deed, conceived by means of folk wisdom and capable of helping many of today’s couples attain eternal love, too. But let me lay everything out in order.</p><p>And I’ll begin with the most important thing.</p><p>************************ Do We Need to Go Looking for Our Soul Mate? ************************</p><p>“My soul mate.” People use this phrase a lot. Let’s define what we mean by “soul mate.” I think many people would agree with the following definition: it’s a person, a man or woman who is a kindred spirit, who shares your views on life, who’s enjoyable to spend time with, who attracts you (in terms of appearance, too,) and who is capable of inspiring you to love.</p><p>Should we go looking for our soul mate, or should the soul mate appear on his or her own, through a stroke of fate?</p><p>As mankind’s centuries-old experience demonstrates, a goal-oriented search is essential. Numerous legends in which kind-hearted lads set off on distant treks in search of their intended attest to this fact.</p><p>There are ancient rites that help in this most important life’s search.</p><p>There are also very ancient rites that help determine whether you’ve made the wrong choice – whether your soul mate has come to you from the evil side.</p><p>I’ve introduced some of these in previous books. Speaking of rites, I haven’t gone into acts that are common knowledge, but for the most part have introduced actions that are unknown and haven’t been encountered anywhere before. I’ll repeat this book’s key point – the rite of marriage and also the rite for determining whether one’s choice is correct – in a different context.</p><p>“So come on, give us the miracle-working rites right away,” some readers will think. “Why do we need the reasoning behind them?” But we do need the reasoning! We need to have a clear picture of today’s reality, and we need an analysis. Otherwise we won’t be able to understand the great meaning of the folk wisdom. Everything in the world is relative, and that’s why we need to compare.</p><p>So let’s take a look at which life’s situations in today’s world can facilitate a meeting and which can hinder it.</p><p>It may seem strange, but in today’s supposed information age, there are actually fewer and fewer situations all the time that make it possible for soul mates to meet.</p><p>It’s as if people living in large, densely populated metropolitan areas are separated from each other by invisible partitions.</p><p>A person who lives in a modern apartment in a multi-story building often doesn’t even know a neighbor who lives on his same floor. Passengers who ride mass transportation are all absorbed in their own problems, even those who stand closely pressed against each other.</p><p>People walking along the street don’t have anything to do with each other, either.</p><p>In America, for example, you can’t look a woman up and down intently, since that might be construed as sexual harassment.</p><p>And so, it’s nearly impossible to find your soul mate sitting in your apartment or on your way to school.</p><p>Let’s say you meet a lot of people through work. Let’s say you sit behind a cash register in a large supermarket. But each of the customers who passes before you isn’t thinking about meeting you. More likely, they see you as an extension of the cash register.</p><p>Although a college or university where many young people are concentrated does give people the chance to interact with each other and pair off, it isn’t a great place in terms of choice, since an institution of learning really does have a different function.</p><p>People these days tend to think of bars, restaurants, nightclubs</p><p> and resorts as the most acceptable places to meet people. But as a rule you don’t get a happy life of love and harmony out of these acquaintances, even those that end in marriage. Statistics show that ninety out of a hundred marriages of this type fall apart.</p><p>To a large extent, the reason for this is the false image. What exactly is that? Here’s an example.</p><p>************************ False Images ************************</p><p>Back before I met Anastasia, I took a cruise on the Mediterranean.</p><p>During mealtime for all fourteen days, I shared a table on the cruise liner with two girls and a young man who worked in a Novosibirsk design institute. Every day the girls would appear in the restaurant in new elegant outfits, with interesting hairdos. I enjoyed socializing with them. Nadya and Valya – those were their names – were always welcoming and cheerful. One day when I was in my meal companion’s cabin, I said to him:</p><p>“What pretty and nice girls those are at our table. Maybe we should flirt with them?”</p><p>To which he answered:</p><p>“I have no desire to flirt with those snakes.”</p><p>“Why snakes?”</p><p>“Well, I work in the same institute they do, and I know what they’re really like.”</p><p>“What are they like?”</p><p>“First of all, they’re troublemakers. Second, they’re unkempt and lazy. Here they make an effort to take good care of themselves. They make themselves out to be nice and sweet little things. It’s clear they came for the express purpose of finding themselves well-off husbands. Just look how they’re flirting with the men from the Armenian group.”</p><p>I had the chance to see for myself how different the girls looked at work at the institute when, after the trip, I went to the institute to visit my cruise acquaintances at the end of the day.</p><p>To put it mildly, their appearance really was not as glamorous as it had been on the ship during the cruise, and their cheerfulness and kindness had vanished, too.</p><p>That means that on the cruise ship they were displaying a false image.</p><p>It’s common for many men and women in today’s world to want to find their soul mates with the help of a superficial image that doesn’t correspond to reality. Might it be that this harmful phenomenon arose because people have forgotten other methods? As a result, both parties end up being misled.</p><p>The man gives flowers and expensive gifts to the image he liked and even offers his heart and hand. But once he’s married, he suddenly sees the real person, who is not at all to his liking and who elicits a feeling of irritation in him, a longing for the vanished image.</p><p>The woman suddenly sees that the suitor, so recently kind and attentive, does not love her at all, doesn’t understand her. Why did this happen? Well, he never loved her in the first place. He loved an image.</p><p>If we take the example of celebrities, especially those we’ve happened to glimpse in everyday life, we can see the striking difference between the artificial image and the real person particularly well.</p><p>A no less sad situation also comes about because a woman often dramatically changes her external appearance after she gets married.</p><p>When a man falls in love with a woman, especially when it’s love at first sight, it’s difficult to say precisely what has given rise to the feeling of love in him. Maybe the tight braid and the color of her hair. Maybe her eyes. We tend to assume that the feeling of love rises up based on the whole combination of external and inner traits. And when a woman changes her appearance, she’s taking away part of what he liked, thereby weakening the love – even if, after she’s radically changed her attire, hairdo and makeup, everyone around her says, “How beautiful you’ve become, how attractive,” and even if remarks like these reflect reality. And even if the husband is delighted by his wife’s new appearance, after some time his love might significantly weaken or disappear entirely.</p><p>He has seen more than a few beautiful women, including some who are much more glamorous than the woman he’s now married to. However, he fell in love with her and the way she used to look. And suddenly her previous image is no more. And you have to admit – once he comes to love the new image, he’s betraying the previous one.</p><p>Why were people in ancient times very wary of altering their attire? Maybe they didn’t have a wide enough choice of fabrics? They did have a choice: silks were brought from across the seven seas, and they could weave fabric themselves, too, either coarse or fine. They could use various dyes to make all imaginable designs on fabric, or embroider them.</p><p>Were they lacking in imagination or means? They had the imagination, plenty of it. Every second person was a marvelous artist and designer. All you have to do is look at old-time houses: they’re all decorated with woodcarvings.</p><p>And every woman knew how to do embroidery. As far as means are concerned, not just people of moderate means, but fairly well-off people, too, tended not to overdo changes in their attire and variety in their hairdos. They were extremely wary of changing their personal appearance and strived to preserve their image.</p><p>The world of contemporary fashion alters images, especially women’s, like a kaleidoscope.</p><p>A drastic change is unusually profitable for the clothing industry: people put perfectly good items out with the trash and buy new, trendy ones, hoping that something new, something resembling happiness, will come along with them. But no, it doesn’t come. All that appears is a new, artificial image someone has created, an image a person himself throws across his shoulders, under the influence of mass propaganda.</p><p>In real life sources today, I’ve yet to come across any well-constructed system of ceremonies to help people in their search for a life partner. What’s more, I’ve begun to get the impression that modern life and our entire way of life are aimed at keeping these soul mates from ever meeting. This kind of situation might even benefit someone. A person who’s dissatisfied with life, who doesn’t have a goal or meaning in his life, benefits many people who make money. He also benefits those who have power.</p><p>So, to answer the question of whether we go looking for our soul mate, I think we should say, no, we don’t go looking for our soul mate. We don’t know how to go looking. And no conditions exist for the search.</p><p>I tried to find some grains of truth in the rites from recent centuries that have to do with the search for one’s intended. Here I’m going to mention several typical rites of marriage. Let’s take a look and see how sensible they are or, conversely, primitive. I’ll make my own comments as we go along, but if you don’t agree with them, then you can cross them out right in the book or white them out and write in your own.</p><p>More and more all the time, I’m starting to think that Anastasia’s grandfather is right: if we ourselves don’t start thinking, then we’ll just keep on accepting all kinds of crap as the wisdom of life.</p><p>I’m not going to describe contemporary weddings. We don’t see anything there besides binge drinking, the placing of flowers at the so-called “eternal flame” and riding around in cars.</p><p>Let’s have a look at earlier rites of marriage.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.204>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>4. Rites of Marriage</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>I’ll describe a rite that was typical for pre-revolutionary Russia, so we can consider it and see how degraded society has become in regard to love.</p><p>Match-making among natives of the city of Perm. For Permians, marriage is complicated, involving various preliminary operations: when a father is seeking a bride for his son, he must obtain the consent of his superior and his parish priest. A marriage of this type is always decided upon without the groom’s participation, seemingly according to ancient custom, and it is determined only by the opinion of relatives and close acquaintances who are consulted. And it’s the fate of the future well-being of their closest relative that is being decided.</p><p>It so happens that the groom finds out who his intended is only at the engagement, and sometimes even on the wedding day; it rarely happens that a young Permian sets himself up with a bride on his own. The groom’s father himself sets his son up with a girl with an abundant dowry, and at the same time, he’s looking for character and good morals in the maiden he’s considering.</p><p>After a final decision is made about which girl to seek a match with, the actual matchmaking (korasyom) begins. This matter is always entrusted to the family elder or, if there is no elder, to the godfather, or else to one of the older relatives – and in general, to someone who’s knowledgeable about such business.</p><p>Next, we’re told how the matchmakers should speak and what they should say, but it seems to me that there is no point at all to these acts, since what’s most important has been violated right from the start.</p><p>As we see, there’s not the slightest hint of love between the young people when this rite is performed. It’s also a sad fact that they add God into the mix along with this humiliating way of treating the energy of Love.</p><p>When the groom is about to set off, his mother or the oldest female relative in the house comes to the table, which is covered with tablecloth, and places on it a loaf of bread set aside for blessing the groom, salt, beer and malted home-brew, and lights candles before the icons. The groom prays, bows to his mother and father on bended knee, soliciting their blessing and, having recited the Jesus prayer, he stands behind the table. All the visitors then come up to the table, reciting the same prayer and one after the other, they pass the gifts or presents they’ve brought across the table to the groom with both hands: roasted shoulder or a piece of raw pork, and always atop bread, and each one says as he does so: “Please accept</p><p> these precious gifts, young prince,” accompanied by the prayer “O Lord, Jesus Christ” and so on. To this the groom replies to each person, “Amen to your prayer,” and then he accepts the gifts, also with both hands, and places them first on his head and then on the table. He plies each visitor with beer and home-brew, rarely with wine, while performing the Jesus prayer and repeating, “Cheers! Drink (whatever it is.)” Of course, each guest the groom addresses responds to this with the words, “Amen to your prayer” and, having accepted the glass, bows to the groom while repeating, “May God grant you long years, great happiness, may you live and be, gain happiness, beasts, a belly, bread and salt, win a princess fair, travel with the princess to the church, stand beneath golden crowns, and accept God’s law!” And then each guest drinks.</p><p>And here’s some more interesting information.</p><p>The girls of Perm rarely preserve their virginity, but the grooms don’t particularly care about that and don’t shy away from them. Quite the contrary, they’re eager to accept them, even pregnant ones, figuring that soon they’ll have a worker. They also say how the fathers of some families have decided that in their family, since they consider their daughters innocent, they feel insulted by an offer of marriage. They’ll berate the matchmakers and even drive them away. Sometime they even pummel them, saying, “What, is my daughter some blood-wite?”, (i.e., guilty of something.)</p><p>What you end up with is not someone who carries on the family line, someone conceived in love and essential, but a farm hand.</p><p>And many typical elements of the marriage rites show our ancestors to be savage barbarians. However I want to note that all the rites known to us are not traditionally Slavic, even those that are sometimes referred to as traditional in various literature. They date from the time when the wise rites that really were traditional were forbidden by the Church, without anything rational being offered in exchange. And here’s an example.</p><p>Removing the boots. According to widespread Russian custom, it was – and in some places still is – the practice for a newlywed wife to remove her husband’s shoes. In ancient times, this custom generally indicated submissiveness, a slave-like relationship and even humiliation, because who besides a total subordinate will remove someone else’s boots? From historical sources, we know that this custom existed during the time of Vladimir, and we also know that the Polotsk prince’s daughter did not want to remove her husband’s shoes.</p><p>The very same custom existed in German during the time of Luther: on the wedding night, the young wife would remove the boots and place them at the high point of the bed (on the headboard) as a sign of the husband’s dominance over the wife, of the man’s dominance over the (enslaved) woman.</p><p>Omari and Gerbenshtein tell about how when they were in Moscow, the custom of removing the shoes was performed, along with the striking of the wife three times with a lash that had been placed in a cabinet along with gifts, even at the weddings of princes and boyars. This rite continued in Lithuania up to the Jagiellonian Era and nowadays is preserved in peasant culture.</p><p>As we see, removing the boots and considering the bride a slave have been incorrectly presented as a traditionally Russian rite. Slavery did not exist in Rus’ before the time of the princes. Consequently, this rite is not traditional for our people, but rather marginal and not accepted by the people.</p><p>But the following situation, which was standard for rites of marriage among many peoples, even in the 18th and 19th centuries, seems even more idiotic, cruel and immoral to me.</p><p>As soon as the last dish, i.e., the roast meat, was brought to the table, the best man would wrap the roast in a tablecloth along with a small loaf of bread and a saltcellar and take it off into the hay store-room to the bed, where the newlyweds, too, were led, following him. The father took his seat in the doorway of the store-room. After passing the bride from his arms into the arms of the husband, he would instruct her regarding seemly behavior and advise her how to live in matrimony. When the young couple reached the bed, the village head’s wife, who was dressed at that time in two fur coats – one worn the regular way, the other inside out – would sprinkle the young couple with a shower of grain, money and hops and feed them on the bed.</p><p>All the wedding’s participants would show up the next day in the morning, throw back the newlyweds’ blanket in a flash and determine, based on certain well-known indicators, that the bride had been a virgin.</p><p>We can consider this the most terrible and perverted part of the rite, even if the newlyweds love each other. In plain view of all the guests, the young couple, drunk and stuffed, has to go into a room and is obligated to consummate the marriage. The guests accompany them and send them off with lewd gazes, like perverts.</p><p>First of all, after all the pre-wedding and wedding bustle, flowing alcohol and voluminous food consumption, the couple would be best off refraining from any intimacy for some time, so they’d avoid conceiving a child in that state.</p><p>Second of all, really, why should the newlyweds be obligated to be intimate with each other on this day, and also have to account for their actions before the assembled guests? And what if this particular day happens to be inauspicious for the girl, for women’s reasons? Basically, all of this resembles the breeding of animals, and even worse.</p><p>No one would take it into their head to lead a bitch to a male dog, or a cow to a bull or a ewe to a ram if they weren’t in heat. But here, it’s, “Go on, do it, or you’ll bring shame on yourself.” Here’s a story that one seventy-year-old man told me when he learned I was studying various rites:</p><p>“I was living in a village when I got married. They arranged a love match for me. She was so quiet, and she was kind. She was called Ksyusha. She was nineteen then, and I was twenty. We spent half a year exchanging glances, she and I, and probably we fell in love.</p><p>“The first day of the wedding, when it was coming to an end, we were sent off to a separate room to sleep. They put a guard at the door, and in the morning we were supposed to appear holding our sheet in front of us to show everyone: did it have a virgin’s blood on it or not? The moment of truth came for Ksyusha and me. And I, well, maybe it was wedding night jitters, or maybe I’d eaten something bad, but I felt I wouldn’t be able to do a thing with Ksyusha. She tried this and that, and started awkwardly showing me her breast, and she kissed me, and then got totally undressed.</p><p>“But still none of the necessary things inside me responded to her caresses and her undressing. And I got even more embarrassed because of that. I sat down on the bed and turned my head to the wall. I hear how Kyusha’s come up and leaned her cheek against my back and is shaking, and her tears are running down my back. And right then I started crying out of grief, too. And so we’re sitting there on the bed and crying. And then I say to her:</p><p>“‘Don’t worry, Ksyusha, I’ll admit it to everyone that it’s my fault.’</p><p>“And she answers me, ‘Don’t do that. They’ll start laughing at you.’</p><p>“And before daybreak she took her finger and tore a hole herself where there needed to be one, and the blood flowed. After that, in the morning, we showed the sheet to the guests who’d come for some hair of the dog. And they were half-drunk, encouraging us and joking and shouting, ‘Bitter!’ before they downed their next shot.</p><p>“Ksyusha and I lived in the village for half a year and then left for the city and got divorced. And you know, nothing worked for me in that half a year. I married a different woman, and now I have four children – three sons and a daughter – and I have grandchildren. But I won’t forget that vile wedding, never in my life. But I still remember Ksyusha.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.205>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>5. It Take more than just the Flesh to Conceive a Person</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Those of you who have read “The Family Book” will recall that the Vedic Russian wedding rite of marriage culminated in the conception of a child by the love-birds Lyubomila and Radomir.</p><p>But back then I didn’t get into asking Anastasia whether the Vedic Russian civilization approached conceiving children in any special way and in general, whether it was worth giving this any special attention. But as if she’d sensed I might ask this question, she herself said:</p><p>“The Vedic Russians had a great understanding of what lay at the heart of conceiving their children. But I don’t yet know how to tell you about this in language you’ll understand.”</p><p>Later, after I’d already spoken with Anastasia’s grandfather, after searching out the rites of different peoples, rites capable of preserving love in the family, I did get the information about conception, and I understood that it wasn’t Anastasia who wasn’t yet ready. It was I who was still unprepared to understand what she’d said, and even now this question hasn’t been adequately studied by our modern day science.</p><p>Scientists are attempting to clone a person, but it seems that once they’ve done it, they’ll get a creature that only outwardly resembles a person. That’s because at the moment of conception, it isn’t just the spermatozoa and egg that participate, but also something invisible, something we don’t perceive as matter.</p><p>It’s possible that some people might be shocked when I lay out the information I’ve received. I spent half a year considering whether there was any point in sharing it with readers or not. Finally I decided that there is. And here’s the problem.</p><p>At the present time, many families living on Earth are, without realizing it themselves,</p><p> raising children who aren’t entirely theirs. There is solid proof of this.</p><p>In the scientific world there’s the term “telegony.” In medicine it’s called the “phenomenon of the first male.” People try to speak of telegony as little as possible. What exactly is it?</p><p>Its discovery dates back roughly to 150 years ago in England, when Lord Morton decided to develop a breed of the strongest horses. To do this, he crossed a purebred English mare with a zebra stallion. But no progeny resulted, due to the genetic incompatibility of these two species. Some time later they bred this very same thoroughbred English mare with a thoroughbred English stud. The mare ended up giving birth to a colt, but… a colt with clearly defined traces of stripes, like a zebra’s.</p><p>And so Lord Morton called this phenomenon telegony.</p><p>Animal husbandry experts actually encounter this phenomenon fairly frequently in the course of their work. For example, any dog-breeding club will reject a bitch that was previously the most purebred if she has mated with a non-purebred mutt. Such a bitch will never again have purebred puppies, even if you breed her with the most purebred males.</p><p>Dove fanciers will immediately kill even the most expensive and purebred dove if a non-purebred “grayling” has defiled her. Practice has shown that she’ll no longer ever have purebred hatchlings.</p><p>Scientists of various countries have carried out a great amount of research that shows that this phenomenon also extends to people.</p><p>There have also been known cases of black-skinned children being born to white spouses. There are cases when a black-skinned little one comes into the world as a consequence of his mother’s grandmother or mother having had relations with a black-skinned man. The reason for such an occurrence always turns out to be pre-marital relations on the part of the girl or her direct ancestors, if their first man was black-skinned.</p><p>Now, these are the clearly expressed factors. But how many of them are there that aren’t clearly expressed? As it turns out, a great many. After all, premarital relations are well within the order of things. And given that that’s the case, you can’t blame a woman if she’s not a virgin when she marries. Our society, the monstrous propaganda about sex and the sex industry have made her who she is.</p><p>Parents in the West provide their school age children with condoms, knowing that they’re already no longer virgins. But they don’t know that no condom can save you from the “phenomenon of the first male,” telegony. Concrete cases from the lives of people and animals show this.</p><p>Many ancient teachings and religions also speak of the phenomenon of telegony, referring to it using different words. But that doesn’t in any way change the essence. Scientists and ancient sages alike think that the first man in a virgin’s life leaves her his spirit and blood’s image. A mental and physical portrait of the children she will bear. All other men who enter into intimate relations with this woman with the goal of conceiving a child give her only a seed and diseases of the flesh.</p><p>Might this not be where the widespread misunderstanding between fathers and children lies? As well as the degradation of all of contemporary human society?</p><p>Many, many concrete examples suggest that a certain energy participates in conception. But if that’s the case, then not only science should know about it, but all people, too. Our recent ancestors probably figured this was the case. They were strict about trying to make sure that a girl who was getting married was a virgin. It’s possible that this is precisely the reason many peoples had the tradition of locking the newlyweds in a separate room during the wedding and then carrying the sheet with spots of blood that attested to the bride’s virginity out of the room and showing it to those present. However, our more ancient ancestors thought that virginity was not the only necessary factor in the birth of the one who would carry on the family name. They asserted that if, during intimate relations with one man, a woman thought about a different man, then a child would be born who looked like the one she’d been thinking about.</p><p>Such assertions show that ancient people supposed – and perhaps knew for sure – that the most important thing in conception is thought. Or more precisely, the energy of thought.</p><p>The phenomenon of telegony also shows this. A woman retains in her memory, perhaps on the subconscious level, information about her first man, and as a result, a child is born who either entirely or partially resembles him.</p><p>At first I figured I shouldn’t write about this topic, so as to not to prompt children, their parents and spouses to ask questions that would be unpleasant for them. Ignorance is bliss. However, the fact is that we’re not seeing any bliss.</p><p>And, it’s possible that we’re not seeing it also because we don’t know about the traditions of conception.</p><p>The question of sex education for children in the schools has been under discussion for a long time now. People argue about whether it should be introduced or not. If this course proposes solely to teach children how to use condoms, then there’s no point in introducing it. Now, if they’re going to tell children about a woman’s main life’s purpose, about the correct way to approach conceiving children – well, that kind of subject is essential. But for this, the teachers need to know the essence of this question and possess the corresponding reading material. It’s essential to talk about this, but unfortunately, all we see in the mass media these days is pro-sex propaganda.</p><p>There’s a lot of talk in so-called democratic countries about a person’s freedom. But can we consider a person free, when essential questions of existence are hidden from him, when perversions that are passed off as something good are pushed on him with the help of supposedly free propaganda advocating perversion? All a person is free from in a situation like this is a true, happy human life.</p><p>And even so, I wouldn’t have written about telegony if Anastasia hadn’t told me about how one can remedy this situation, even if a woman who’s getting married has already had relations with another man.</p><p>And what’s more, it turned out that the Vedic Russians had a fabulous rite you can use to make “others’” children your own, in both blood and spirit.</p><p>Our pagan forbears and especially the Vedic Russians were well aware of the phenomenon that modern medicine calls the “phenomenon of the first male.” And they protected young folks from it with the help of special rites.</p><p>The sages were also able to erase the “first male’s” genetic code with the help of certain ritual actions and make even girls who had been raped during enemy raids absolutely pure. As proof, they were not afraid of marrying their sons off to them.</p><p>But there is one “but.” It’s impossible for us to comprehend and repeat pagan and especially ancient Vedic Russian rites simply by knowing their surface elements. We have to get a feel for them.</p><p>What’s the point of just writing? It’s essential to love, essential to prepare for a child’s appearance, essential to make sure to give birth at home, in the spot where he was conceived.</p><p>What’s the point of just writing, that “in order to preserve love in the family for all eternity, it’s essential to unite into one whole three points, three feelings and three planes of existence.” It’s not enough for us to grasp this with our minds alone. It’s essential for us to feel it. To feel the philosophy of our forbears.</p><p>And the first essential act can only be to ask forgiveness from our forbears, who are now called pagans, who were slandered, whom we betrayed. We betrayed the traditional Slavic culture of our fathers and mothers. A culture that existed for tens of thousands of years.</p><p>We called Christianity traditional for Rus’. But it has existed in Rus’ for a total of only one thousand years and in no way falls into the category of “traditional.”</p><p>Why is it essential to ask forgiveness? Well, for the simple reason that if we’re going to persist in considering our forbears savage, dull-witted barbarians, as we’ve been forcibly indoctrinated to believe, while at the same time adopting their rites, then they won’t be efficacious. Because all their rites are based on knowledge of the cosmos, of the role of the planets, on knowledge of the power of mental energy and the power of thought.</p><p>We will attempt to use their rites to switch on the colossal energy of our thought, but we’ll get no positive result, since our thought will be opposed by a different thought we have, the thought, “They were stupid.”</p><p>It’s a paradox. You’re a stupid fool, but your actions are beautiful. One excludes the other, or one opposes the other.</p><p>Perhaps there’s a reason they’ve hidden the culture of our ancestors from us? It’s easier to control ignorant, confused people who have been separated from their roots. Perhaps this is God’s way of punishing our civilization? Folk wisdom holds that, “As you sow, so shall you reap.” We’ve severed the connection to our forbears, and as a result the threads connecting our children to us are being severed.</p><p>Based on traditions that have been preserved in contemporary China and especially in Japan, where a man and woman go through a special purification ritual before entering into intimate relations so as to conceive a child, we can also conclude that our pagan forbears were more highly educated regarding the question of conceiving children. The faiths of Ancient China, Japan, India and Ancient Greece – which were traditionally ancient pagan countries – paid great attention to the question of conception.</p><p>And so what exactly is each person who wants to bear good progeny to do? Does he have to spend a lot of time studying a great number of treatises on this topic beforehand? And does he then have to spend a lot of time studying treatises</p><p>
 that help one choose an intended and raise children?</p><p>I’ll say right away, that there’s no need to spend part of your own life studying them. I spent several years not studying them, but just acquainting myself with them, and I suddenly understood that the Vedic Russians simply condensed all these giant works into a system of simple, merry and sensible rites for every occasions. You get the impression that God himself helped them formulate these rites and also helped them grasp the essence of human existence.</p><p>Before attempting to make use of our forbears’ experience, we need to determine whose experience we’re talking about.</p><p>What I mean is, what part of present day Russia did our ancestors occupy, and how many years ago?</p><p>As we know, historical sources, including those written in Russian, tell of the life of people in Egypt and Rome five thousand years ago. Archeological digs were and still are carried out in these countries, and huge streams of tourists make their way to them.</p><p>Even in our own country’s historical literature, only one thousand year period of life in Rus’ is described.</p><p>It’s as if they’re saying our state’s territory was barren, somehow, or that basically there was nothing there at all. But was that the case? Or are people purposely concealing our history from us? Yes, they’re concealing it. I’ve already written about this, but now I’ll present some archaeological information.</p><p>I’ll tell about Arkaim, a spot that is directly related to the question of telegony. Anastasia’s grandfather has said that a great discovery was made in that very place three and a half thousand years ago.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.206>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>6. Into the Depths of History</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>************************ Arkaim – The Sages' Academy ************************</p><p>In 1952, satellites sent photographs back to Earth of several unusual circles that were clearly defined on the surface of the Southern Ural steppe. No one doubted that these circles had been artificially produced. But no one could say for sure what exactly they were.</p><p>An argument flared up in scientific and occult circles at that time about where to look for the motherland of the Indo-Europeans. Scientists supposed, not without reason, that many European peoples, as well as the peoples of India, Persia and part of Asia, had at some point in time had one and the same source – the mysterious Proto-Indo-European peoples.</p><p>Many researchers dreamed of finding the ruins of the country where the legendary white Aryan race had lived. The researchers were striving to, at the very least, make contact with the ancient, lost, arcane knowledge that the ancient Aryans had possessed.</p><p>When excavations began in the Arkaim Valley, archaeologists announced to the scientific world that they’d discovered a most ancient city more than forty centuries old, that had been inhabited by people from the earliest Indo-European civilization. Researchers began referring to Arkaim simultaneously as a city, a temple and an observatory.</p><p>Those among you who are interested in the scientists’ hypotheses can learn more about them in the professional literature.</p><p>I’ll pass along what Anastasia’s grandfather told me about Arkaim. The logic of his thought is far more precise and interesting than the logic on which the scientific hypotheses were based.</p><p>He started off by telling me this:</p><p>“Arkaim is not a city and not a temple. As far as it being an observatory goes, that’s correct, but that’s not exactly the main point here. Arkaim was an academy. You can refer to it by that contemporary term. The teachers of the sages lived and worked in Arkaim. Here they spent their time investigating the Universe and determining the interconnection between astronomical bodies, and their influence on man. They didn’t record their very great discoveries or make long speeches in public. Based on their many years of research, they would work out the rites and present them to the people, then observe how efficacious they were. When necessary, they would introduce corrections. Finally, they would be able to refer to their lengthy research using one or two short words, behind which lay the essence of their discovery.</p><p>For example, there are the very ancient rites of Savior of the Honey Feast Day, which is celebrated on August 14, and Savior of the Apple Feast Day on August 19.</p><p>People would not consume apples from the new harvest Before Savior of the Apple Feast Day, or honey from the new honey gatherings before the Honey Feast Day.</p><p>In the course of their lengthy research and observations, the sages determined that before the specified date, the apple brings a person no significant benefit, even if it is ripe. And it doesn’t have to do just with the apple itself. Many fruits and edible grasses and root vegetables that are beneficial for people ripen before the Savior of the Apple Feast Day. If a person begins consuming apples, he has no room left for the produce that’s more beneficial at that moment.</p><p>It was the sages who determined that there’s a reason why fruits in nature ripen in a certain sequence. And this very sequence also constitutes the very Divine diet for man, the diet which science fruitlessly sought in subsequent centuries.</p><p>You could compose treatises many volumes in length about how this research was conducted.</p><p>But the sages didn’t compose such treatises, didn’t trouble people with them: they offered people a ready-to-use conclusion presented in several words. And the people believed the sages. Life always confirmed their advice.</p><p>In addition, if you compare Vedic Russian sages with Greek wise men, Egyptian priests and today’s supposedly great scientists, we see enormous differences. The sage received no titles or rewards for his very great discoveries, couldn’t amass wealth, and had no power, unlike, for example, Egyptian priests. And no one would ever bow to the sage the way people today bow to many so-called spiritual hierarchs. The only thing the sage would receive when he’d come to some settlement was food, clothing or shoes, if what he was wearing was worn out, and a spot where he could have a rest. But the sages would sometimes refuse shelter and sleep beneath the open sky.</p><p>He would also receive the sincere, unfeigned respect of the people.</p><p>And over time, this process would bring to the fore the best of folk thinkers and teachers.</p><p>Out of gratitude to the sages, the people built structures like Arkaim according to the sages’ plans. These were places where the sages would go to reflect, where they could share their thoughts with each other. Where they would speak, as if before some high-level scientific board, about their discoveries and describe the rites they had worked out based on them.</p><p>People often didn’t even know who was behind this or that rite, or whom to thank for a wise and efficacious rite.</p><p>For example, one sage – one of the greats in human history – who was a philosopher, astronomer and psychologist, devoted ninety years to studying how to overcome the phenomenon we today call telegony.</p><p>He found a way to do this and presented people with an efficacious rite that’s only about fifteen minutes long. True, preparing for it took much longer. Vladimir, ask Anastasia, and maybe she’ll tell you about it.</p><p>Only I’ll tell you right now: one can comprehend and feel this rite only by understanding the feelings of love that our distant forbears had and their philosophy of love. The further back into the past you’re able to penetrate with your thought, the more comprehensible the rite will be.</p><p>In order to convince ourselves that what Anastasia’s grandfather had said about Arkaim’s purpose is true, let’s take a look at its architecture.</p><p>Arkaim had a circular shape with an exterior diameter of around 160 meters. As we see, that’s entirely too small for a city. But I’ll call it a city, as scientists currently do.</p><p>It was surrounded by a circular, two-meter-wide, water-filled moat. The exterior wall was quite massive. Five and a half meters high, it was five meters wide. There were four entrances in the wall. The largest was on the southwest, and the remaining three were smaller and located on opposite sides.</p><p>A person entering the city immediately found himself on the sole, ring road that was about 5 meters wide and which divided the dwellings abutting the outer wall from the walls of the inner ring.</p><p>The road had a log surface, and a two-meter canal connecting it with the circular moat on the outside had been dug beneath it, along its entire length. Thus, the city had a storm sewer: the excess water seeped through the log roadway and ended up first in the canal and then in the circular moat.</p><p>All the dwellings that abutted the outer wall, like segments of a lemon, had exits that opened onto the main street. A total of only 35 dwellings of the outer circle has been found. That number is a bit low, even for a village.</p><p>Further on, we see the mysterious ring of the inner wall. It was even more massive that the outer wall. Three meters wide, it reached a height of seven meters.</p><p>According to excavation data, there was no passageway through this wall, except for a small gap in the southeast. In this way, the 25 interior dwellings that were identical to the outer circle’s dwellings, would essentially have been isolated from everyone by the high, thick wall. In order to reach the small entrance into the inner circle, one had to pass along the entire length of the ring road. This had a hidden meaning. A person entering the city had to follow the path the Sun takes. And, finally, we have Arkaim’s crowning central square – nearly square in form, at roughly 25 by 27 meters.</p><p>Judging by the traces of campfires that had been arranged in a certain formation, this square was used for performing certain rites.</p><p>Thus, what we see, in simplified form,</p><p> is a Mandala – a square inscribed within a circle. In ancient cosmogonic texts, the circle symbolizes the Universe, and the square – Earth, our material world. An ancient wise man who possessed perfect knowledge of how the Cosmos was organized could see how harmoniously and naturally it was set up. Therefore, when building a city, it was as if he recreated the Universe in miniature.</p><p>Arkaim was constructed according to a design that had been previously laid out, as an integrated, intricate complex that also happened to be oriented toward astronomical objects with very great precision! The pattern formed by the four entrances in Arkaim’s outer wall represents a swastika that follows the course of the sun.</p><p>The swastika (Sanskrit – “connected to the good,” “greatest good fortune”) – is one of the most archaic sacral symbols, one we encounter in many of the world’s peoples as early as the Upper Paleolithic. India, Ancient Rus’, China and Egypt, and even the mysterious state of the Mayans in Central America make up the partial geographic distribution of this symbol. We see the swastika on old Orthodox icons. The swastika is the symbol of the Sun, success, happiness and creation. And, correspondingly, the swastika pointing in the other direction symbolized, for those of Ancient Rus’, darkness, destruction and the “nighttime Sun.” As we can see from ancient motifs, and particularly those on Aryan pitchers found in the vicinity of Arkaim, both swastikas were used. This has deep significance. Day takes the place of night, light takes the place of darkness, new birth takes the place of death – and this is the natural order of things in the Universe. For this reason, in ancient times there weren’t “bad” and “good” swastikas. They were perceived as a whole (like the energies of Yin and Yang in the East.)</p><p>Arkaim’s exterior was beautiful: a perfectly circular city with striking towers at the entrances, burning fires and a beautifully fashioned “façade.” This was most certainly some kind of sacral design that had a meaning. For everything in Arkaim was infused with meaning.</p><p>Each dwelling abutted either the exterior or interior wall with one of its sidewalls and opened out onto the main ring road or the central square. In each improvised “entranceway” there was a special water drain that emptied into the canal beneath the road. The ancient Aryans were provided with a sewer system. In addition to this, each dwelling had a well, a stove and a small dome-shaped storage area.</p><p>Two earthen pipes branched off from the well above water level. One led to the stove and the other to the dome-shaped storage area. What were they for? It’s all ingeniously simple. We all know that if we look into a well, the cool air is always drawn out of it. And so, in the Aryan stove, this cool air created such a strong draft when it passed through the earthen pipe that it made it possible to smelt bronze without using a bellows! Each dwelling had this kind of stove, and all the ancient blacksmiths had to do was sharpen their skills as they competed in craftsmanship! The other earthen pipe that led to the storage area guaranteed a lower temperature inside it.</p><p>The well-known Russian astroarchaeologist K. K. Bystrushkin carried out research on Arkaim as an astronomical observatory and came to the following conclusion.</p><p>Arkaim is not just a complex structure, but even a subtly complex structure. When its layout was studied, its similarity to the famous Stonehenge site in England was immediately discovered. For example, the diameter of Arkaim’s interior circle is said to be an even 85 meters throughout, but in actual fact, it’s a ring with two radii, of 40 and 43.2 meters. (Just try to draft that!) Meanwhile, the radius of Stonehenge’s “Aubrey Holes“ ring is 43.2 meters! Both Stonehenge and Arkaim are situated on the same latitude, both in the center of a bowl-shaped valley. And they are separated by nearly 4,000 kilometers…</p><p>Scientific researchers say, “If we add up all the facts we’ve gathered, we can say that Arkaim is a horizon observatory.” Why a horizon observatory? Because when taking measurements and making observations, people would use the moments when the celestial bodies (the Sun and Moon) rose and set, in relation to the horizon. As well, they would note the moment when the lower edge of the disc “separated” (or touched,) which makes it possible to mark the spot where this occurred most precisely. If we observe the rising of the Sun, then we see that each day the point of sunrise shifts from its previous spot. Reaching its northerly extreme on June 22nd, this point then moves to the south, reaching its other extreme mark on December 22nd. Such is the cosmic order. There are four well-defined visible observation points of the Sun. Two of them – the points of sunrise on June 22nd and December 22nd and two similar sunset points – are on the other side of the horizon. Add two points – the moments of the equinoxes on March 22nd and September 22nd. This provided a sufficiently precise determination of the length of the year. However, there are many other significant events each year. And one can mark them using the other celestial body, the Moon. In spite of how complicated it is to observe the moon, ancient people nonetheless knew the laws of its movement across the heavenly vault. Here are some of them:</p><p>1) The full moons occurring close to June 22nd are seen at the point of the winter solstice (December 22nd) and vice versa.</p><p>2) The Moon events migrate away from the solstice points according to a 19-year cycle (the “high” and “low” Moon.)</p><p>As an observatory, Arkaim made it possible to track the Moon, too. All in all, it was possible to observe 18 astronomical events on these huge wall circles, six connected to the Sun and twelve connected to the Moon (including the “high” and “low” Moon.) By comparison, Stonehenge researchers have been able to identify only 15 celestial events.</p><p>In addition to these amazing events and facts, we’ve gotten the following data: Arkaim’s measure of length was 80 centimeters. The center of the interior circle is offset from the center of the exterior circle by 5.25 Arkaim measures, which is close to the angle of tilt of the Moon’s orbit – 5°9', plus or minus 10 minutes. K. K. Bystrushkin is of the opinion that this reflects the relation between the orbits of the Moon and Sun (for an observer on Earth.) Correspondingly, Arkaim’s outer circle is dedicated to the Moon, and the inner – to the Sun. In addition, astroarchaeological measurements have shown that several of Arkaim’s parameters are linked to the precession of the Earth’s axis, and that’s an achievement of the highest order, even in modern astronomy.</p><p>And so, we see that we cannot call Arkaim a “city,” not by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>It’s impossible for a family to set up house in such a very small room.</p><p>But it’s ideally suited for philosophers to engage in reflection.</p><p>Historians are aware that in ancient times, the sages were considered wise men and teachers. Consequently, Arkaim, as one of the greatest scientific centers, could have belonged only to the sages. There simply weren’t any other scientists during those times.</p><p>It’s also known that the sages worked out and corrected the rites based on knowledge of the Cosmos.</p><p>The question is, where are these unique rites now? What kind of obscurantism destroyed them or is hiding them from people?</p><p>************************ What Was Sungir Trying to Tell Us? ************************</p><p>And now I offer you some even more sensational information for your consideration – the Egyptian pyramids and the ruins of Ancient Rome pale by comparison with what I’m going to tell you.</p><p>We also need this information so that we can, as the Siberian hermit said, better understand the phenomenon of our ancestors and the extent of their knowledge of the universe.</p><p>He said:</p><p>“Your thought can travel back three thousand years, and you’ll gradually begin to sense the wisdom of those three millennia. Travel back five, and you’ll have the wisdom of five, but not everything will be comprehensible to you. You need a minimum of twelve millennia’s worth.</p><p>It seemed entirely implausible to me to delve into our country’s historical past that way. I was fully prepared to go to India, to Tibet. They say you can learn more about our forbears there than you can in our country. However, I didn’t have to go anywhere. It turned out that everything was right at hand, and now I invite every reader of these lines to direct your thoughts about our ancestors back in time, more than twelve thousand years into the past.</p><p>The archaeological find I’m going to tell you about was discovered by chance on the outskirts of the city of Vladimir, which, according to various official data, is approximately 1015 years old.</p><p>In 1955, while excavating a quarry to extract clay for the Vladimir Porcelain Factory, excavator operator A. F. Nacharov noticed in the excavator’s bucket the bones of a very large animal, bones that had been lying at a depth of 3 meters. Archaeologists were informed of the find…</p><p>And the very first digs stunned the scientists. The human remains, adornments and everyday objects found in the graves were evidence of some kind of ancient culture.</p><p>Subsequent research indicated that our forbears came to the shores of the Klyazma River way back in the era of the Old Stone Age, around 25 thousand years ago.</p><p>Someone might think that they ran around on all fours or in rawhide with clubs. No. The scientists were astounded by another fact.</p><p>There were many adornments adjacent to and on the actual skeletons, and they were used to reconstruct the ancient people’s clothing, which turned out to be similar to a jumpsuit or an entirely civilized dress.</p><p>The find was such, that it would have been easier to say these were the remains of a space alien burial. Otherwise, we’d have to reconsider</p><p> our entire historical worldview.</p><p>The Vladimir State Museum of Local History set up an exhibit devoted to these unique finds in one of its halls. They put out a booklet in which it’s said that the Sungir site – a most interesting Russian archaeological memorial – is well-known to archaeologists throughout the world. International scientific symposia have been held here a number of times.</p><p>Sungir is one of the northernmost settlements of ancient man within the Russian plains area and the territory of Vladimir province. In terms of the wealth of objects and the preservation of such ancient remains, it has no equal in the world.</p><p>Thanks to the joint efforts of archaeologists, geologists, paleontologists and paleobotanists, we can imagine how the people of this immeasurably distant time lived.</p><p>Here, at the edge of the glacier, the tundra began, covered by sparse islands of spruce groves and pine, birch and alder forests. The animal world was diverse.</p><p>As the booklet says, “The ancient Sungir people hunted the reindeer, wild horses, the artic fox, wolverines, bison, brown bears, wolves, and the arctic hare; they knocked grouse, wild chickens, and the silver gull from the sky. And of course, they hunted the mammoth – a huge, now extinct animal nearly four meters high and weighing 6 tons. This was a prized trophy: the meat, the pelt, which was indispensible for constructing dwellings, and the tusks, a strong and precious material for producing weapons and adornments.”</p><p>The bone and horn inventory is very interesting: shaft straighteners, hoes, pikes, arrowheads and beads made of mammoth tusk, adornments made of arctic fox fangs. The small, flat figurine of a large-headed horse was a rare work of primitive art. The renowned little Sungir horse is decorated with a design of indented dots and red ochre. The number of dots on the figurine, a multiple of five, attests to the existence of a quinary counting system among the site’s dwellers. And the use of multiples of seven also shows the knowledge of these people who lived 25 thousand years ago. But it was the ancient people’s unique burials that brought world-wide fame to the Sungir site.</p><p>In 1964, atop a deep layer of ochre-colored rock, the skull of a female was discovered, and below it, the remains of an elderly male. On his chest lay a stone pendant, and on his arms were 25 disk-shaped bracelets made of mammoth ivory, and on the skull, along his arms and legs and on his trunk, nearly 3.5 thousand beads lay in rows. Their location on the skeleton made it possible to reconstruct the ancient Sungir man’s beaded suit. It was reminiscent of the fur clothing of modern arctic peoples. On the bottom of the shallow grave were discovered a knife and a flint scraper.</p><p>The burial site discovered five years later turned out to be just as rich.</p><p>The remains of an adult person, without the skull, had been buried in the grave. Alongside were ivory beads, a ring and a pair of reindeer horns. But further down, at a depth of 65 centimeters below the upper burial, lay two children’s skeletons.</p><p>The 12-13-year-old boy and 7-9-year-old girl had been placed in the grave stretched out, theirs heads closely pressed together. The children had been accompanied into “the other world” by hunting weaponry made of mammoth ivory: 11 spears, 3 daggers and 2 pikes. Of particular interest were the one-piece javelins made of split and straightened tusks 2.5 and 1.5 meters in length. They also found “staffs” fashioned of mammoth ivory in the burial site, as well as very expressive figurines of a horse and mammoth, and carved, notched disks that evidently had some ceremonial significance and were connected to the cult of the Sun and Moon. The children’s clothing was also beaded with thousands of beads and was fastened together on the chest with pins made of bone. Strings of beads replicating animals’ tails had been sewn onto the back of the clothing.</p><p>This find indicates that a complex burial ritual and sophisticated religious beliefs existed among the ancient peoples of the Stone Age. We can confidently posit that they believed in the after life.</p><p>Comprehensive archaeological research has been carried at Sungir, beginning in 1956 and continuing up to the present, with only small gaps. For almost 20 years, this work was directed by Otto Nikolaevich Bader, the well-known archeologist and Doctor of Science. The anthropologist and academic M. M. Gerasimov and his students, G. B. Lebedinskaya and T. S. Surina, succeeded in reconstructing the ancient Sungir people’s external appearance.</p><p>As we know, anthropologists can reconstruct people’s faces with reasonable precision based on their skulls. This was a rare opportunity to take a look at the faces of ancient peoples. I took advantage of this opportunity. Here were the entirely conscious, wise face of an adult man, the slightly sad face of a little girl, and the thoughtful face of a little boy.</p><p>But the suppositions about hunting, especially regarding mammoth hunting, seemed a bit off.</p><p>I took Anastasia’s grandfather to the unique hall of the Vladimir museum. The elder slowly made his way along all the exhibition stands, stopping at none, and then stood in the middle of the hall and bowed four times, turning ninety degrees after each bow. When I told him what the scientists had concluded, he refuted much of it and said the following:</p><p>“Vladimir, these people never hunted mammoths. Mammoths were their domestic animals. They were good helpers on the land, a means of conveying cargo. They did more types of work than the elephants in India today that the mahouts handle.</p><p>“By standing atop a mammoth, these people could collect fruit from the high trees and stow it away into woven bags and baskets and then transport it to the necessary spot.</p><p>“The mammoth would clear the family’s glade of young forest seedlings had encroached on it or, if he was given such a task, he’d make the glade bigger by shaking and then ripping out trees. When it was necessary to migrate from one place to another, people would pack all their household possessions, implements and food stores onto the mammoth.</p><p>“It was a very kind and hardworking domestic animal. Even a little child could take hold of the soft end of its trunk with his little fingers and lead it behind him.</p><p>“The children would often play with the mammoth: they’d make it take in water with its trunk and them spray them with it.</p><p>“It would give the mammoth pleasure to watch the little kiddies jumping and squealing joyously.</p><p>“The mammoth felt great bliss when they’d brush out his fur with a special instrument, something like a rake. The person would rinse out the fur, dry it and then use it for his own purposes, like making bedding.</p><p>“These people had no need to hunt mammoths. You can tell that even from the information you read in that booklet. One point in it contradicts the other.”</p><p>“Contradicts it how?”</p><p>“Judge for yourself. There’s a list of all possible wild game that they could easily catch – as many as they needed – by using special traps. If a person killed a mammoth weighing 6 tons, he’d be unable to eat all its meat at once.”</p><p>“But what if there were a lot of people?”</p><p>“There couldn’t be a lot. People in ancient times didn’t live clumped together the way they do now in villages or towns. Each extended family had its own lands. Each family had its own territory, its own house. No more than 100 people would live within a three square kilometer area. They couldn’t consume a six-ton mammoth in the space of 2-3 days, even if they ate nothing but meat. The spoiling meat would begin to decompose and attract great numbers of insects. It could cause an epidemic.”</p><p>“But maybe they’d invite people from other territories to come and join them in a feast?”</p><p>“What sense does it make to travel several kilometers simply in order to eat meat when you have plenty of it at home?”</p><p>“But if you’re saying that the decomposing mammoth carcass could pose the threat of an epidemic, then a domestic mammoth could pose the very same threat when it died.”</p><p>“Vladimir, a mammoth never died among the family. When he grew old and sensed that death was approaching, he’d go a short distance away from the home and trumpet three times. Then he’d go far away to the mammoth graveyard and die. You should know this yourself – after all, that’s what wild Indian elephants still do, now. They trumpet before death and leave their herd.”</p><p>“So that means we have an entirely mistaken understanding of the ancient people’s diet?”</p><p>“Yes, that’s the case. Perhaps because that’s a way to justify today’s barbarous way of treating animals. The further you go back in history, the fewer meat-eaters you can find. They had large enough quantities of plant food. And they used only that animal food that the animals themselves gave to man – milk and eggs, for example. The first people’s stomachs could be afflicted if they ate meat.</p><p>“Another proof of the fact that hunting was not the main way of getting food for the first people is that hunting is irrational if you compare it to the other way of procuring food.”</p><p>“What other way?”</p><p>“Getting it from tamed, domesticated animals. Imagine a person whose farm has a female mammoth, a cow and a goat, all of which you can milk and get a fresh, top-notch food product every day. The person also has domesticated fowl on his farm: a goose, a duck, and a chicken that give him eggs and which require no special care. He’s able to take some portion of the bees’ honey and pollen, and there’s also a multitude of root vegetables and edible grasses nearby. And suddenly it’s as if the person goes out of his mind. He kills all the domestic animals that, in addition to everything else, enabled him to sleep soundly. He eats them all and starts hunting wild animals, thereby subjecting himself to danger and no longer having any guarantee that he’ll be able to regularly feed himself or his</p><p> family fresh food products.</p><p>“In place of friendly surroundings and the love his domestic animals have for him, he receives an exclusively harsh environment in which, we can say, it’s practically impossible for his family to survive.”</p><p>“But did the first people really start domesticating and training animals right away? Maybe that happened in a later period?”</p><p>“Well, man wouldn’t have had any later period at all if he’d immediately shown himself to be an aggressor. Vladimir, you’re well aware of cases when even predatory wolves might nurse an infant who’s ended up in the forest, but a wolf pack in the very same forest might rip an adult apart. Why do they treat the person in such different ways?”</p><p>“It’s hard for me to say.”</p><p>“It’s because in the first place, the human infant has no aggression, but in the second, aggression and fear are present, and they cause the environment discomfort.</p><p>“There was no feeling of fear and aggression in the first people. Love and a sincere interest in the surrounding world dominated in them. For this reason they did not need to expend any particular efforts at all to domesticate and train the animals and birds. The most important thing for them was to determine the life’s purpose of each creature they encountered on Earth. And this they did. As far as animals are concerned, you already know that the greatest blessing for them is the love a person feels for them, the attention he pays them.</p><p>“The first person to consume meat was an inadequate person, one deserted by the energy of Love. It was as if he’d gone out of his mind or fallen ill with the most terrifying disease. This disease has come to the present day, too.”</p><p>“But what connection can there be between love and man starting to eat meat?”</p><p>“There’s a direct connection. A person who lives in love is incapable of killing.”</p><p>“Perhaps. But can you determine why these children died 25 thousand years ago? Why they were buried in such an unusual way, with their heads touching?”</p><p>“Of course, I can, but it will be a very long story. Besides, it isn’t why death caught up with them that you need to determine now, but for what purpose.”</p><p>“For what purpose, then?”</p><p>“There you go again, Vladimir, asking nothing but questions. Too lazy to think for yourself. Just don’t take offense at me for using the kind of words I used out there in the taiga, when you grew insulted. Better for you to reflect on what the point of my story is. The story will do you only a great disservice if you don’t learn to think on your own.</p><p>“I speak and you listen, and at that time, your thought isn’t working on its own conclusions, but only acknowledging mine.</p><p>“In the past, you set a goal for yourself of discovering the conditions under which love could live with people for eternity, and to restore them to the present day. That’s good, it’s the right course, and the most important goal of all.</p><p>“You’re trying to determine when love began living amongst people. And look, there’s data right in front of you. Think. In front of you lie two children’s skeletons. Their death at such a young age will make no sense as long as people are unable to discern the important information that lies hidden in their burial.</p><p>“Their death will acquire meaning if you take this information in now.”</p><p>I didn’t take offense at the elder for what he said about my mind being lazy. I understood long ago that he’s tried over and over, using some methods of his own, to teach me to employ my own thought in a different way. But really, I didn’t go to the kind of school they did, where they’d work on their thought from the time they were children. I went to a regular school, one that, perhaps, actually shuts the thought off.</p><p>And so here I stand before the children’s skeletons, I’m straining to think and I can’t understand how one could learn anything at all from looking at them about a love that existed 25 thousand years ago. And really, did it even exist in those times?</p><p>“It did,” the elder suddenly said.</p><p>“But why are you so sure? I mean, there’s nothing a single word on the museum plaque about love.”</p><p>“Not a single word? Where do you get that? Take a close look. Judging by the skeletons, these are children. A twelve-and-a-half-year-old boy, and the girl, she’s eight.</p><p>“There are hundreds of little beads made of bone on their skeletons. Based on how they’re arranged, your scientists were able to determine what kind of clothing the children were wearing. But is that all the little bone beads tell us?”</p><p>“What else could they tell us?”</p><p>“That these children’s parents loved them very, very much, Vladimir. They loved their children and each other. Only loving parents could spend a great deal of time preparing such a painstaking decoration for their children’s clothing. This also tells us that they had more than enough free time to engage in artistic pursuits and to design and then fabricate good clothing.</p><p>“Among the objects found in the grave, there were absolutely no murder weapons.”</p><p>“What about the spears? Aren’t those weapons?”</p><p>“Of course not. They aren’t even harpoons for fishing, since they have no barb on the end. The end of the object that’s been called a spear isn’t even very sharp. It would be hard to kill or wound anyone with a thin, light spear, no matter who they were.”</p><p>“Well then, what was this object used for?”</p><p>“For training and guiding animals. Look how much it resembles the rod today’s animal trainers use, and the rod mahouts these days use to guide elephants.”</p><p>“But why did they have to fashion it out of bone? They could also have gotten a stick and not spent time straightening out the bone and ornamenting it.”</p><p>“A stick won’t serve for long, and the animals get used to one object, to its shape and to the scent it acquires from being touched by the master’s hand.”</p><p>“All right, everything you say is convincing enough, but there are also objects that look like arrowheads. And after all, an arrow is intended for killing.”</p><p>“Among these particular people – not the earliest period of human life on Earth – arrows were to be used for scaring off predatory animals that would attack them.</p><p>“Among the objects there are also some resembling hoes. They really are an implement for sowing seeds and digging out roots.”</p><p>“Well, what about the decorations? There are beads there made from arctic fox fangs. And the clothing – scientists assert it was made of leather, so that means they did kill animals after all.”</p><p>“The scientists were correct in asserting that their clothing was made of leather, but they had no need whatsoever to kill animals to be able to do that. There were reptiles that would shed their old skin. It would happen that the reptiles would die for some reason or other, and then ants would eat away the entrails, leaving the skin intact, and the skin was often very suitable for constructing clothing. Under such circumstances, it’s idiotic to spend time killing an animal, butchering the carcass, processing and drying the leather, and softening it. Why do that, if you can get something that’s already prepared and in ideal condition? All of man’s needs have been provided for in Divine nature. And it’s also much simpler to get arctic fox fangs for beads from a skeleton that’s been processed and dried by nature.”</p><p>I’ll interrupt Grandfather’s story about the archaeologists’ unique find at this point.</p><p>In the booklet that the Vladimir State Museum put out, there are two drawings of exhibition pavilions – in the “Sungir” architectural park and the “Sungir” museum complex. We’re told that international symposia have convened around this unique find.</p><p>However, don’t set off just yet to visit this unique spot with its excavation sites of an ancient civilization. There are no pavilions at that location, nothing but the ruins of unfinished buildings. And there’s no intensive archaeological work being conducted. The government can’t find the resources for serious work like this. We could say it’s being conducted thanks to the enthusiasm of the scientists and local authorities.</p><p>I went to this unique spot on a weekend day. I saw two people in one of the pits taking soil samples from its sides and carefully placing them into little plastic bags. They turned out to be employees of the State Archaeological Institute, and they confirmed that in terms of archaeological finds, Sungir is the richest site in the world for studying ancient man.</p><p>The Vladimir museum’s exhibit is the only one in Russia. They told me that tourists sometimes visit the excavation site in Sungir, but mainly ones from Japan, because the Tokyo National Archaeological Museum houses a more comprehensive exhibit about Sungir.</p><p>It’s strange, I thought, that they end up treating our ancient ancestors, who lived within the territories of our country, with more respect in the Land of the Rising Sun than we ourselves do.</p><p>We speak about Russia’s great mission, about spirituality, about how we have to preserve our country’s image, but how can you talk about preservation when foreign tourists can see with their own eyes how we feel about history?</p><p>So, then, all we can do is hope that maybe our more civilized descendants will learn what other secrets lie undiscovered in Sungir.</p><p>I was lucky enough to learn that 25 thousand years ago, our ancestors were civilized people, that they knew how to love with fluttering hearts and preserve that love for all eternity.</p><p>************************ The Family Structure ************************</p><p>It seems clear that if we want to bring back the lost, efficacious traditions and rites that help preserve love in families, we have to obtain more extensive information about the lives of our ancient ancestors.</p><p>To do this, we have to go far back into the historical past, all the way to the family community structure, to the time when a man a woman fell in love with each other and created a close-knit family community out of their children, grandchildren and</p><p> great-grandchildren.</p><p>Today, a man and a woman are unable to keep hold of even their closest relatives – their children. As soon as they’re barely grown, they try to get away from their parents. They go off to a dormitory or a rented apartment, often to the detriment of their financial situation, but off they go.</p><p>And it’s not just the children! Many couples take to their heels even before children are born, or soon after they’re born.</p><p>The family community structure existed for many millennia before the rule of princes in Rus’. It was characterized by a lack of divorces and by exceedingly strong families, compared to the other social structures of our society that followed it. Only true love is capable of forming a family. It was much easier for grown children in the past to leave their family than it is now. I’m talking about the period before the rule of princes in Rus’.</p><p>I’m talking about a period when young people who had fallen in love could leave the house if their relations with their parents didn’t suit them. They could build a dwelling for themselves on their own, on a spot they took a fancy to, find nourishment in the forest and then, by working the land, make a farm for themselves. But they didn’t leave. That means the founders of their family line treated them with understanding and love.</p><p>It’s essential for us to study this period and bring the grains of truth that can help us build stable families into our modern lives.</p><p>But how? How can we make our way to the information about this period when people lived, if Russian history describes only the Christian period?</p><p>We also need to take an excursion into the historical past of our people so we can determine whether the ancient rites and culture disappeared all on their own, because they were not useful, or whether the millennia-old traditions were intentionally destroyed.</p><p>If they disappeared all on their own, then it’s not worth digging around in the historical past, since the people themselves rejected the ancient culture because they found it wasn’t useful. And thus, they won’t accept it now, either.</p><p>If the ancient traditions were intentionally destroyed, then we have to figure out by whom and with what goal. We have to figure that out, find these traditions and then offer them to society for consideration.</p><p>It’s possible that secrets of human existence lie concealed within the ancient rites and traditions – such secrets that, if we don’t unearth them, we’ll keep heading toward the abyss, dying out and being tormented by familial strife. We often speak of large-scale wars. But family conflict is often more painful for everyone involved than news of the war in Iraq or events in Israel.</p><p>I thought back over all I knew about the history of Ancient Rus’ and decided, strange as it might seem at first glance, that the only thread that could lead us through the maze of historical fabrications is Genghis Khan. Or, to put it another way, the period of the so-called three hundred year Tatar-Mongol yoke in Rus’. Why is that? Well, because this period began soon after Christianization, when our forbears’ traditions had not yet been fully destroyed. And also because Genghis Khan was perhaps the most colorful, interesting and enlightened personality of his time. Not only because he and his descendants conquered half the world. One wonders how they managed this. I can tell you right now – their army played a secondary role in this matter. We know from a variety of historical sources that Genghis Kahn sent expeditions off to many countries, all the way to China and India, which supplied him with wise men. He spent a great deal of time conversing with the wise men. He was trying to determine the meaning of man’s existence on Earth and find immortality. In other words, he collected the wisdom of various peoples, and it’s entirely possible that he had information about the social structure of Ancient Rus’.</p><p>And, as I came to find out, he did. I’m convinced that thanks to this information, his extended family, his sons and grandsons were able to keep the so-called nobility of many countries in line over a period of centuries. I didn’t misspeak: it wasn’t the countries, the populace he kept in line, but precisely the nobility who were usurping the populace of these countries.</p><p>Someone might say, come on, what connection could knowledge of the ancient family traditions and rites that were capable of preserving love, have to do with successfully subduing states?</p><p>Don’t be surprised – it’s a most direct connection, and this knowledge is more powerful than the swords of millions of warriors and even than the most modern weaponry.</p><p>I’m not going to go into the entire three hundred year period of Tatar-Mongol rule in Rus’. I’ll describe only one episode, but one that’s entirely characteristic and interesting – the conquest of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality.</p><p>I’ve collected information about it from a variety of sources. Let’s try to draw some conclusions together.</p><p>************************ A Mysterious Tactic ************************</p><p>The chronicles, contemporary historical sources and church literature all make reference of the mysterious and even secret military tactic that Khan Baty, Genghis Khan’s grandson, employed on the outskirts of the city of Vladimir in the spring of 1238. What was so mysterious about it? Here’s what the chronicles say:</p><p>“Having taken Ryazan in 1237, Baty burst into the city of Suzdal with his horse cavalry in the spring of 1238” and then, as a great number of church sources inform us, he burned Suzdal. He wiped out some portion of the population and took some portion captive. Much is said in these very same sources of the “atrocities perpetrated against the people.”</p><p>However, secular sources describe the situation more precisely and impartially. So for example, here’s what’s said about the given event in the materials of the State Vladimir-Suzdal Museum:</p><p>"The Tatars set up their camp by the city of Vladimir, and then they set off and took Suzdal, and they sacked the Holy Mother of God (cathedral) and burned the prince's court and burned the Saint Dmitry Monastery and sacked the others; and they cleaved the old monks and nuns and priests, and the blind, and the lame, and the deaf, and the hard-working folk and all the people, but as for the young monks and nuns and priests and their wives, and the deacons and their wives and daughters and their sons – they led all of them off to their camp, and they themselves set off for Vladimir."</p><p>As we can see, Baty didn’t take the entire population captive, not by a long shot. He wiped out the old, high-ranking monks and took the young ones captive. He burned and sacked the prince’s residences, the churches and monasteries of Suzdal, not the entire city.</p><p>And now let’s try to solve this supreme historical riddle. Why, as it’s said in the materials, did “the Tatars set up their camp by the city of Vladimir and then set off and take Suzdal”?</p><p>Any military historian, and any contemporary military commander, too, will say that this kind of tactic contradicts military strategy.</p><p>To set up camp beneath the walls of a large fortified city, then leave it and head for a smaller one with the troops – that’s the same as committing suicide.</p><p>The distance from Vladimir of that time to Suzdal was 35 kilometers. Overland, this was a day’s travel on horseback.</p><p>They would need a minimum of several days more to take Suzdal and then another day for the return journey.</p><p>But really, only one day would have been enough for the warriors defending Vladimir to come out of the fortified city and obliterate the camp that had been left without troops. To seize the spare horses, spare quivers and arrows, food stores, assault ladders and stone-throwing equipment, thereby making it impossible for the enemy not only to storm the city, but to wage war in general.</p><p>But they didn’t come out. Why not? Perhaps they didn’t know that Baty’s troops had left the camp? They knew. They could see that from the tops of the fortress walls, and the scouts would have told them, too.</p><p>Maybe Baty’s troops were so numerous that the camp’s guards alone would have been enough to repel an attack?</p><p>That’s the way historians explained it at first. They said the Golden Horde numbered nearly a million. Then they changed their minds and began lowering the figure – to 130 thousand. Some lowered it to 30 thousand.</p><p>Of course, it would be tempting to use the greatly superior enemy numbers to explain one’s defeat. More objective scholars began saying it would have been absolutely impossible to travel with an army a million strong at that time.</p><p>A million sabres – together with baggage, that means three million horses. A herd of horses like that would die of hunger if it stayed in one place, even in the summertime, since it would trample all the grass around it. And in the winter, there wouldn’t be enough forage for it at all.</p><p>And so the figure was lowered to 30-130 thousand. A totally disgraceful figure. Baty’s one hundred and thirty thousand strong force had no trouble at all conquering Russian principalities and entire countries, one after the other.</p><p>But even this figure is too high. Thanks to the knowledge that Genghis Khan left to his descendants, they wouldn’t have needed even a force of fifty thousand to subdue the Russian princes of that time. All they needed was knowledge of the Russian people’s way of life and of Russian families, plus a sound policy based on this knowledge.</p><p>And, having set up camp near the city of Vladimir, Baty didn’t set off with his troops for Suzdal. He sent a small detachment off to take it. That’s why the people of Vladimir didn’t come out of the fortified city to obliterate the camp and destroy their enemy’s military equipment.</p><p>And do you know how many days and night it took Baty’s little detachment to take one of the spiritual capitals of Russia of that time – the</p><p> legendary city of Suzdal, which was by that time surrounded by more than half a dozen fortress monasteries?</p><p>No time at all. They just walked right into the city, burned down the residence of the prince who’d fled along with his retinue, cut down absolutely all the high-ranking church clergy, and took the young monks captive. And then the Mongols caught up with the prince and his retinue, too, on the Sit River and wiped them out.</p><p>Maybe you’re wondering, how can that be? Where were the brave Russian people, with their defiant and freedom-loving spirit?</p><p>I can tell you right now that everything’s just fine as far as the Russian people and their spirit are concerned. Logic suggests that the people applauded Baty’s small detachment as it was on its way back from Suzdal. They offered kvas and home brew to his warriors all along the way as they made their way back to the camp outside Vladimir.</p><p>The thing is, the people didn’t consider the city of Suzdal of that time their city. To tell the truth, they considered the princes living in it to be traitors, and they saw the clergy as foreign invaders and subjugators. This is why people’s rebellions flared up more than once against their unbearable oppression.</p><p>In the materials of the State Vladimir-Suzdal Museum, we’re told:</p><p>"By the end of the 13th century, there were 8 monasteries in Suzdal. Founded by princes and representatives of the Christian religion, they played a large role in the acquisition of new lands and served as fortresses in case of military danger."</p><p>"In the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th centuries, the Church owned one third of the best lands in the country and was striving to exercise control over the regime of the Great Princes. Starting at the end of the 15th century, the government attempted to limit land ownership by monasteries and the Church and to secularize, i.e., totally liquidate, it. The land question gave rise to two ideological streams within the Church: those of the Josephites and the Non-Possessors. The first was characterized by defense of monastery property, and the second by the idea of interior self-realization and rejection of acquisition by the monastery. The Josephites' ideologue was Joseph, Abbot of Volokolamsk Monastery, and the Non-Possessors' was Nil Sorsky, a monk of the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. As major landholders, Suzdal's monasteries and clergy took a firm stand on the side of the Josephites. However, in the 16th century, the regime of the Great Princes was unable to enact secularization, and the Church's land wealth continued to grow, although on a limited scale."</p><p>Not bad! A third of Russian lands belonged to the clergy from Constantinople and its henchmen. The monasteries became prominent serf owners. And it wasn’t monks who worked the land and bred livestock, but peasant serfs.</p><p>And the princes were already trying to get back a portion of their lost country. But no such luck.</p><p>And the peasants whose indigenous, native lands suddenly became monastery lands – what spiritual riches did they gain? What was offered to the people in exchange for their many-millennia-old traditions and rites that were declared barbarous? As the very same archival documents show, this is what happened:</p><p>"Fees and Fines Collected from Peasant Serfs of the Pokrovsky Monastery in 1653</p><p>From each household – 2 altyns, a chicken, and lamb's wool from the first shearing</p><p>For purchases of:</p><p>Horses – 2 dengas Cows – 1 denga.</p><p>For sales of:</p><p>Grain, a horse, a cow, hay – one altyn per ruble A log house – 1 denga per corner.</p><p>For settling disputes:</p><p>Concerning field land – 2 altyns 2 dengas Concerning household land – 4 altyns 2 dengas.</p><p>Court fees:</p><p>For travel to the site of the hearing – 1 denga per verst For travel in case of acquittal: 2 dengas per verst From the guilty party – 1 altyn per ruble From the blameless party – 7 altyns 2 dengas For an oath – 4 altyns 2 dengas</p><p>Wedding fees:</p><p>From the groom – 3 altyns 3 dengas From the bride for a table – 2 altyns 2 dengas From a groom from another district – 2 grivnas. For the brewing of beer for a holiday, wedding or funeral feast – 1 bucket of beer.</p><p>Fines:</p><p>For distilling alcohol for oneself without permission or for its sale – 5 rubles, a beating with rods, and arrest. For using alcohol on week days – 8 altyns, 2 dengas and a beating with a rods."</p><p>And here’s a description of the property of a high clergyman:</p><p>"Inventory of the People and Property of Metropolitan Hillarion:</p><p>"16 elders, 6 directors administering the holdings, 66 personal security personnel, 23 servants, 25 choristers, 2 sacristans, 59 artisans and working people. 180 people in all.</p><p>"A total of 93 weapons, silver dishware weighing 1 pood 20 pounds, pewter dishware weighing more than 16 poods, 112 horses from the Metropolitan's horse farm, 5 coaches, 8 sledges and carriages, 147 books."</p><p>(From the inventory book of the metropolitan's household, 1701.)</p><p>A unique document. It’s free of any historical ambiguities whatsoever. It lists, simply and impartially, the possessions of the metropolitan’s home. However, it raises a great many questions.</p><p>What kind of holdings are these that require 6 whole directors to run?</p><p>What does one person need with 23 whole servants?</p><p>And are the 93 weapons also for the purpose of performing church rites?</p><p>And please note that all of this is personal property, not monastery property. The monasteries had their own property.</p><p>Against whom did they need such a large security force to defend them? In sheer numbers, it exceeded the security force of the first US presidents.</p><p>Well, a large security force, like the tall monastery walls, was intended to defend the metropolitan from the Russian people, of course. The walls of Suzdal’s monasteries had no strategic military significance.</p><p>But then why do nearly all the historical sources speak of the tall monastery walls with their crenelles as fortresses that defended the people from the enemy?</p><p>Why didn’t these so-called fortresses hold out even for a month?</p><p>Well, because they weren’t intended to defend against an outside enemy, especially a clever one.</p><p>Fortifications like these basically provided the warriors of Genghis Khan’s grandson with a way to amuse themselves. If these laughable fortresses’ owners didn’t submit to demands for swift capitulation, the warriors would construct mounds of dirt a bit higher than the walls and drag their stone-throwing device up onto them. From there, they had many options, one of them being to load a bag tied with a long tow rope into the stone-throwing device with and throw the bag over the monastery wall. Before it hit the ground, the bag would come untied and contaminated meat would spill out onto the people taking cover behind the walls. After which all they had to do was shoot all the people who tried to run out of the gates.</p><p>The only thing the high monastery walls were saving people from was their own peasant serfs who rioted from time to time – or more precisely, from the monastery slaves.</p><p>In actual fact, it was the Constantinople clergy that employed its lofty spirituality to implement serfdom in Russia.</p><p>A document from the archives of the Suzdal museum attests:</p><p>"In the 17th century in Suzdal, church land ownership predominated, as it had previously. Monasteries and the metropolitan’s home were large feudal landlords with huge resources and the unpaid labor many thousands of serfs at their disposal.</p><p>Thus, Spaso-Evfimiev Monastery was fifth among the ecclesiastical feudal lords of Russia. Its welfare depended entirely on land grants and investments. In the second half of the 17th century, the previously established patrimonies did not increase in size, since the state held excessive growth in land ownership by monasteries in check. Peasants were subject to dual exploitation, both from the side of the owners (forced labor and rent) and the state (rent in kind and monetary rent.)"</p><p>Or a citation from yet another similar document from the history of the Svyato-Pokrovsky Convent:</p><p>"The nuns' easy, rich life was secured through the labor of peasant serfs and a huge staff of servants; the land holdings of the Pokrovsky convent grew thanks to rich investments and land grants from the most distinguished families in Russia, including those of princes and tsars."</p><p>And there you go: more lands equals more serfs and more wealth.</p><p>But let’s return to the 13th century.</p><p>So what exactly did take place as Baty’s detachment approached Suzdal? And what do traditions and love have to do with it?</p><p>Suzdal’s population at that time was less than 4 thousand people. Basically, that meant the prince’s retinue and the prince’s servants, craftsmen and highly placed clergy who hid from the people behind the monastery walls with a great number of unpaid servants.</p><p>Tens of thousands of peasant families lived around Suzdal and Vladimir, families that could put up serious resistance to an aggressor. But they didn’t do this, didn’t form militias, didn’t pass beyond the monastery walls to defend the clergy. They just really hated the clergy. Note – it wasn’t God they hated, but their oppressors. The people loved and revered God.</p><p>This is the reason the people didn’t rise up to defend the city of Vladimir, either.</p><p>Baty waited for six whole days before commencing the storming of Vladimir. He waited for the news to get around: it’s not the people I’m going to seize, but those who have enslaved them.</p><p>He waited, and then took the well-fortified city in the space of just one day. That’s why he carried out the campaign against Suzdal, a campaign that had no significance whatsoever from a military point of view, but which deprived the regime of the support of the people.</p><p>And what steps did the Golden Horde take after that?</p><p>They saw that they couldn’t find better overseers and tax collectors than the princes who collaborated with the clergy, and they began giving the princes letters of the</p><p>
 khans, authorizing them to govern. And they began giving them the right to collect taxes from the Russian people, a portion of which they had to send to the Horde. And they freed many monasteries from any taxes at all.</p><p>And everything I’ve said above is confirmed by actual documents. So that no one will lay the blame on me or academics or lay historians, let’s turn to actual church literature:</p><p>In a decent history book published by the Svyato-Pokrovsky Convent, with the blessing of the archbishop of the Vladimir and Suzdal Eulogius, we’re told:</p><p>“Holy Hierarch Fyodor, the first bishop of Suzdal, was born in Greece. He arrived in Rus’ in 987 as a member of the suite of ecclesiastics who accompanied Constantinopolitan Holy Hierarch Michael.</p><p>“Hierarch Michael baptized Great Prince Vladimir in Korsun and subsequently became the first Metropolitan of Kiev.</p><p>“After the Christianization of the Kievans in 988, Prince Vladimir, Equal-to-the-Apostles, along with his sons and Holy Hierarch Michael, traveled around to the Russian cities, zealously spreading Christianity. They appointed bishops in Chernigov, Belgorod, Pereyaslavl, Novgorod and Vladimir-Volynsky.”</p><p>As we can see from this statement, as well as from other sources, foreign ideologues appeared in Rus’, a whole crowd of them at once, with hired guards, and they began going around to Russian cities with the Prince’s retinue, destroying multi-millennia-old foundations, sowing an ideology that was beneficial to them and placing foreigners in charge of the cities.</p><p>A great many historical documents show how the people resisted this, and it’s clear that they were insufficiently organized and that they didn’t expect their very own prince to betray them.</p><p>In this way, a massive campaign was carried out against Rus’, thanks to the princes’ treachery. And the saddest part is that it was carried out in the name of God. What unbelievable sacrilege!</p><p>But could it be that Prince Vladimir and the Constantinopolitan bishops really did sincerely believe in Christ’s commandments? Subsequent events show that their true masters were the complete antithesis of God. And they, the servants of this antithesis, knew full well how to enthrall the people and bring their spirit and will under their own control. They would inculcate a person with the idea, “You are God’s slave,” but what they meant by that was, “You’re my slave.” And the person would begin to forget that God doesn’t have and can’t have slaves. But man is God’s son, and the son is beloved.</p><p>All the citations I’ve introduced in this book were taken from historical documents, and I gained access to them not in some super-secret archives, but by paying the 15-ruble entrance fee for the State Museum and 30 rubles for the right to photograph the exhibits. I photographed the displays that had been put out for all to see. One of them is actually called “Monasteries as Spiritual Feudal Lords.”</p><p>And that not at all the only official state source, not by a long shot. There are many of them.</p><p>For example, a 10th grade school textbook published by “Prosveshchenie” (“Enlightenment”) Publishers in 2003 and recommended by the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation has an incalculably greater influence, especially on young people. The textbook is a high-quality publication, edited by A. N. Sakharov and V. I. Buganov. On page 63 we read:</p><p>“In addition, the Church persecuted the old folk pagan culture, came out against the Roman model of Christianity of, calling it ‘Latinism’ and apostasy. This damaged connections between Rus’ and countries that embraced Catholicism and served to isolate Rus’ from Western European culture. Church operations began making use of slave and servient labor. Some clerics and monasteries engaged in money lending and would fleece the people. There were cases in which prominent Church political figures took part in political intrigues. In this way, the Church’s words were often at variance with its deeds, and this caused discontent among the people.”</p><p>We’re also told in this textbook that Prince Vladimir, who baptized Rus’ in 987, “… was the son of Svyatoslav by a slave of his mother by the name of Malusha. For this reason, he occupied a secondary position among the Prince’s sons.”</p><p>Further on we’re told: “Vladimir spent a little more than two years in foreign lands, and when he turned up near Novgorod, he had a powerful Varangian retinue in tow. He quickly reestablished his rule in Novgorod and began mounting a campaign against the south. Along the way Vladimir took over Polotsk, where he killed reigning Varangian Rodvolg and his sons and forced his daughter Rogneda to become his wife.”</p><p>Further on in this textbook we’re told of how Kievan Prince Yaropolk, Vladimir’s brother, came to negotiate with him and, “No sooner had he come into the tent, than Vladimir’s bodyguards ran him through with swords.”</p><p>We’re told of the Christianization and of the sworn obligation to pay the Church 10% of the tribute collected from the people. Bear in mind that at this time, the Church was subordinate to the Constantinopolitan Patriarch. Rus’ didn’t have its own, and consequently, the Patriarch from Constantinople had the 10% tribute from the Russian people at his disposal.</p><p>It’s in historical facts like these that the answers to the following question may lie hidden: Why didn’t the people rise up to defend the Church when Peter the Great closed one third of the monasteries, but instead recast the church bells into cannons; or when Catherine the Great secularized (confiscated) monastery lands, with the result that formerly wealthy monks were forced to beg for alms for food and live by the grace of the Tsar? And why, when the Bolsheviks were executing all the clergy and blowing up cathedrals, did some segment of the populace openly participate in the looting of church property?</p><p>In treating the topic of the Church, I have drawn on concrete historical facts and documents and made it my goal to challenge sensible church bishops and wise elders – I’m certain these kind do exist – to make today’s Church into a highly spiritual institution that’s capable of helping society make its way out of an economic and spiritual crisis.</p><p>************************ Love and the State's Combat Readiness ************************</p><p>But what connection can there be, the reader might wonder, between love and the conquest of Rus’ ? It’s actually the most direct connection possible. By seizing Russian lands and kabbalizing the Russian peasants, by forbidding the rites that help love form, the Constantinopolitan assault forces were hampering the formation of strong, loving families, and of family settlements, too, of course. For all intents and purposes, serfdom was introduced nearly immediately.</p><p>Love between serfs, as a rule, is unhappy love.</p><p>If you want to sustain the flame of love in young couples once it’s sparked to life, the couple needs to have their own space, and if they don’t end up getting that, then as a rule, love takes its leave. But what space could a serf possibly have? None at all.</p><p>Let’s think about why, over the course of the thousands of years before the princes came on the scene in Russia, no one had occupied our territory. After all, there were the Egyptian army and the legions of the Roman Empire, but their armies, with soldiers who were well-trained and well-armed for that time, did not invade our lands. In order to answer this question, let’s imagine that Genghis Khan’s troops had attacked Rus’ in the time before the princes.</p><p>At that time, nearly all people within the territories of our current country lived in family settlements.</p><p>Whenever any army – of whatever size – approached, the settlers, so as to preserve and defend their extended family from the invasion, would hide a portion of their provisions, take a portion of it with them and go off into the forests. They’d take their livestock with them. Packhorses and cows would carry the family belongings.</p><p>The enemy army could penetrate only so deeply into the territory as the provisions in their own baggage would allow. But that would already be an army of dead men: it would be impossible for them to make their way back.</p><p>They couldn’t hunt in the forests, since they could do that only in small groups – a crowd would scare off the wild animals, but small groups that made their way deep into the forests would perish immediately once they encountered an ambush.</p><p>They mainly ate the meat of their own emaciated horses, whose numbers quickly diminished, and it would basically become difficult to move.</p><p>Our forbears would set up a great number of clever traps all along the escape route they imagined the enemy would follow, both in the forest and on the water. For example, they would sink a huge tree with sharp branches and stretch out a rope. They’d tie one end to the tree and secure the other on the bank; when a boat reached this spot, the tree would float up, catch the hull in its branches and then sink again, overturning the boat. And arrows and harpoons would fly from the shores of the river toward the retreating soldiers.</p><p>But once the army gathered up the troops that had stretched out in a convoy and came out onto the shore, they’d find no one there.</p><p>People would destroy the enemy who came onto their motherland. They had something to defend. This wasn’t some abstract motherland designated only by a pretty word that doesn’t imply even a patch of native land. They had their extended family’s land, land on which their forbears had lived, and on which they now lived with their families, their children, their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren.</p><p>And there was love in their families. And they would defend their beloved mothers, fathers and children. They would defend love! And for that reason, it was impossible to vanquish them.</p><div class=chapter id=08.207>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>7. Russia Erased</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Anastasia’s grandfather and I rode along in silence. When the buildings of the city of Suzdal appeared in the distance, I said to him:</p><p>“Look. That’s Suzdal, a city that’s around a thousand years old. It was part of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality. As a matter of fact, it was one of the spiritual capitals of that time.”</p><p>“Why are you going there, Vladimir?”</p><p>“I want to visit the museum again, have a look at those ancient structures so I can make sense of the lives of the people from the last millennium.”</p><p>“Try to make sense of it before you come into this city. Everything surrounding it deserves immeasurably more attention.”</p><p>“There’s nothing surrounding it but fields and some dilapidated villages here and there. There’s no information to help me make sense of things.”</p><p>“Stop the car, Vladimir. It’s not fitting for us to talk while we’re driving.”</p><p>“There’s nothing to be afraid of. I’m not a bad driver.”</p><p>“I’m not afraid. I know, and that’s why it’s better for me not to say anything.”</p><p>I pulled off to the side of the road and stopped the car. A short time later I realized I couldn’t drive while we were conversing. The thing was, that like Anastasia, her grandfather sometimes speaks with a kind of special intonation, and the listener sees pictures take shape before him, as if a hologram were appearing in space. This kind of speaking makes it possible to show a picture from the past or the future. To show life on a different planet, which Anastasia did one time. It’s hard to say what the source of this phenomenon is. Perhaps it’s hypnosis, or some kind of secret capability that individual people of the priest’s order possess. Or maybe all people who lived on Earth far back in antiquity possessed abilities like these. When a talented actor’s on stage, he also uses intonation and his own experiences to create all manner of pictures and images before the public. True, they aren’t as vivid and detailed as Anastasia’s. However, actors’ mastery does confirm that man really does possess these kinds of abilities.</p><p>It turns out that ancient people didn’t need television broadcasting, with all its huge staff and technology, including satellites. It turns out that when man loses the natural abilities God gave him, he replaces them with ones that are unwieldy and artificial and immeasurably less advanced. And he’s even proud of himself and refers to these inventions as achievements.</p><p>But the saddest thing is, that modern mankind is beginning to lose the ability to think logically. This isn’t just a sad fact, but perhaps a most terrifying epidemic that’s capable of turning modern mankind into a horde of rodents who’ve lost their minds and are eating each other and destroying their own habitat. Suicidal rodents.</p><p>We need to make sense of what Anastasia’s grandfather told me there in the field. We can draw a conclusion from it: when the people of the Earth lost the ability to think logically, they stopped being able to see and understand the unenviable situation into which they were being herded. Judge for yourself.</p><p>I stopped the Jeep by the side of the road. Getting out of the car, the gray-haired elder set off into the field, and I followed him. He stopped before long and bowed down to the ground, saying as he did so:</p><p>“O good people, I greet your thoughts and aspirations.”</p><p>He pronounced this phrase very sincerely and in the kind of tone that made it seem there really were some people standing before him. And then something happened next that I still haven’t been able to figure out and give a name to.</p><p>First there was some kind of movement of the air, and a barely noticeable fog began rising from the earth. It was like it was taking a solid shape, and before long, the outlines of some kind of person grew clearly visible. The outlines were growing clearer and clearer. And then before us there appeared an elderly man with a powerful build. His brown hair was bound with a cord, and his expression was calm, his gaze a bit sorrowful. Behind him, in the distance, I could see gardens, groves, and beautiful wooden houses with towers. It seemed that today’s empty fields had once been settled by a great number of families.</p><p>The man standing before us was soundlessly saying something to the Siberian elder. The vision lasted for several minutes. Then it began to disappear slowly, as if some invisible person was erasing it. Erasing the real, genuine Rus’. The vision totally disappeared when Anastasia’s grandfather turned toward Suzdal. For some time he looked silently in the direction of the city, then turned to me and asked:</p><p>“Vladimir, what do you think about the original purpose of the city we see off in the distance?”</p><p>“What’s there to think about? Everyone knows from history that the clergy was concentrated in this city. The Christian bishops lived here. And the monasteries and the kremlin where the nobles would convene have been preserved. That’s an historical fact.”</p><p>“Yes, an historical fact. But all of Russia’s ancient cities have two histories. The initial one is more significant.”</p><p>“Most likely, we’ll never learn about the initial one.”</p><p>“We will learn, Vladimir – you can determine it right now using your logic, and you’ll even be able to see it. But first, within you, determine for yourself the reason the cities arose and the initial rationale for them.”</p><p>“I think the rationale was that it was easier to live together, easier to defend oneself from enemy attacks. For example, in addition to the clergy and the nobility, a lot of craftsmen lived in Suzdal. They’d make horse harnesses, carts, sleds, pots, plows, and harrows. They’d sell all of that, and that’s what they’d live on.”</p><p>“To whom would they sell it?”</p><p>“To the peasants, of course.”</p><p>“Precisely: they would sell or exchange their goods for food products. And food products would arrive in the city from the many homesteads surrounding the city.”</p><p>“Yes, of course that’s how it was.”</p><p>“But what came first, or what was of primary importance in this spot – the homesteads or the city?”</p><p>“The homesteads, I think. Builders and craftsmen get hungry every day. If they’d begun building a city in an empty field, they wouldn’t have had anywhere to get food.”</p><p>“Correct. And so we’ve come to a conclusion: just slightly more than a millennium ago, in the fields surrounding this city, stood magnificent, rich homesteads. And the spot where the city of Suzdal is now located, was the spot where their kapishche was.”</p><p>“What is a kapishche?”</p><p>“It’s the place where people from the whole region would gather together on certain days for fairs so they could exchange goods and obtain the implements they needed. They would share their experiences. They would put on festivities for all that included merry games to help people seek out their intended ones.</p><p>“The elders of the family lines would also come together here for a veche, a town meeting, and they would adopt key unwritten rules for life. And they might censure those who were guilty of wrongdoing, although such acts were rare. Their censure was more terrifying that any tribunal or corporal punishment.”</p><p>“But who governed the whole region?”</p><p>“A lackey. I can’t find a different word for it. The lackey was the manager at the kapishche. But he didn’t govern. He carried out the decisions the elders made.</p><p>“For example, were they to decide to build hitching posts, a new road or a large barn, then they’d pick out people from each homestead to turn their decision into reality. Sometimes they’d charge the lackey himself with finding journeymen like himself to hire.</p><p>“It was also his job to keep the whole kapishche clean and tidy. For example, say there’d been a fair and the people had dispersed. The hitching posts would need to be straightened up, and the manure would need to be cleared away from the whole area. The lackey and his assistants would carry out this task. If he was careless in his work, the elders could relieve him of his duty. And then the lackey would go hire himself out to a different kapishche or he’d remain in the same one, but serve as an assistant in the retinue’s crew of lackeys. It was hard for the elders to find lackeys: nearly all people wanted to live on their own homesteads. And that’s why it might happen that they’d seek managers for the kapishches from other countries.</p><p>“The Vedic Russian order existed for many millennia in Rus’ during the time preceding rule by princes. It was superior to all government orders you see today. It was widespread on all continents on Earth.</p><p>“And when bacchanal seized the Earth, when Egpyt fell into slavery and Rome did, too, the Vedic Russian order still remained in Rus’, for five and a half thousand years. “</p><p>“But why did the Vedic Russian order give way to bacchanal?”</p><p>“Are you more interested in Rome, Ancient Egypt, or Rus’? Although it all happened pretty much the same way everywhere.”</p><p>“If it was the same, then you’d better tell me about Rus’. I already know that it suffered an attack from outside, and that in the course of that the traditions and culture of a great civilization were also destroyed.”</p><p>“There were attacks, but that’s not the only point. The Vedic Russian order gave way first in other countries, when there was no one left to wage attack. There were no armies. There were no wars, because there were no causes for them. All the land at that time was made up of beautiful homesteads. The people’s culture was supreme, and their way of thinking, too. Every person knew that it wasn’t fitting to take the fruits of another’s garden by thievery or force, because they wouldn’t be wholesome, but rather, dangerous.</p><p>“Only those fruits that people gave freely, because they wished to give, could bring benefit.</p><p>“To take livestock from another’s homestead by trickery or force was not fitting, either. A cow won’t let a stranger near it. And another’s</p><p> dog will suddenly turn out to be an enemy instead of a friend. A horse, should it not be yours, will seize the right moment and throw the rider.</p><p>“So who, if this is the way they think, would take it into their heads to attack? Attacks are absurd when you have this way of thinking. Bacchanals for the most part come from ignorance or, to be more precise, from betraying our ancestors’ culture and way of life, even in tiny ways. The links of our extended family chain lead us to God. To betray the meaning of your ancestors’ lives is to kill God within ourselves.</p><p>“Yes, of course, they deceived the people in Rus’, and the priesthood perfected its techniques. And they are still operating now. In their time, the elders overlooked that sly move, and generations have been paying for their mistake, right up to the present day.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.208>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>8. The Elders' Mistake</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>************************ From Lackeys to Princes ************************</p><p>“At the beginning of the current era, there were emperors, pharaohs and tsars in many countries. The form of rule where one person heads a large state is unnatural. It has not brought a successful, happy life to a single nation on Earth, and it never will. This kind of form is advantageous to the priests, who have manipulated countries through their rulers. After all, it’s hard to come to an agreement with an entire nation all at once. It’s easier to do this with just one person.</p><p>“Only in Rus’ did it happen that they just couldn’t manage to install a single ruler. Everything in Rus’ was controlled by councils of family elders. You couldn’t buy these councils off or use threats to force them to make some decision or other and oppress the people. Who would make a bad decision that would affect one’s own children?</p><p>“And so the priests’ assistants made numerous attempts to arrange for a sole ruler to govern the people. The priests’ assistants used tricky methods – different ones in different places – in an attempt to impose princely rule on the people.</p><p>“Here’s how it went in this location, for example.</p><p>“One day a traveler arrived from afar at a Vedic Russian kapishche – it was on the site of present day Suzdal. They allotted him shelter and food, just the way they did for sages and wandering performers and craftsmen.</p><p>“The traveller lived there for two weeks, but didn’t engage in any useful activity. The manager lackey questioned him:</p><p>“‘O wanderer, in what way can you be of use to the kapishche?’</p><p>“And the wanderer answered him:</p><p>“‘In no way, but for you I can perform the greatest of services. I have heard that the elders are not pleased with you. A year or a half-year will pass, and they’ll push you aside. Should you accept my advice, the elders will come crawling to you on their knees. And you will have the pick of maidens from any homestead for your wife. But now, not a single one wants to live with you. I can arrange it so that everyone will carry out your decisions, not those of the family elders.’</p><p>“The lackey – the kapishche manager and mucker – agreed to listen to the newcomer – the priests’ agent. And the newcomer suggested this to him:</p><p>“‘When people from the region come together at the kapishche for the fair and lay down to sleep until the next day, then in the middle of the night, cut your own face with a knife and ride off from the kapishche on your horse along with your trusted helpers, so that by the next evening you can come back with your horses all worn out. And during the night, I’ll take my helpers (they’ve already assembled here, posing as craftsmen and performers) and lead the horses away from the hitching posts. And you’ll bring them back in the evening, as if you’d won them back from the evildoers. Wounded, you’ll ask the elders to establish an armed retinue of guards for their protection. And they’ll agree. Take my comrades as your retinue. They’ll obey you dutifully.’</p><p>“The lackey agreed to this evil deed. He did everything the way the newcomer had suggested.</p><p>“When the ‘wounded’ man returned toward evening with the herd of stolen horses, he learned that the newcomer’s henchmen hadn’t just stolen the horses, but had also killed three people and burned down the smithy and the barn. The ‘wounded’ lackey appeared before the elders. He told of how he’d chased the evildoers with his helpers, and about how the evildoers were stronger and had given them a beating. And he started asking the elders to give him the means to maintain a strong retinue of guards and allow him to make decisions on his own regarding keeping everyone safe.</p><p>“The elders were shocked at this most unprecedented evil deed and agreed to maintain a retinue of guards, only they didn’t want to take their own sons away from their homesteads. They suggested the retinue be made up of people from outside their area, and they decreed that for living expenses, they would be given tribute payments from the homesteads. Following their example, armed retinues of guards began being formed in other kapishches, too.</p><p>“Now that they’d gained power, the lackeys began turning into princes. Staging battles between each other and presenting them to the elders as a necessary preventive strike.</p><p>“It seemed to the princes that they’d gained even greater power. But in actual fact, for centuries, often without realizing it themselves, they had been strictly following the priests’ advice. Here’s the kind of government system that formed: the lackey remained a lackey – he just changed masters. The new master was exceptionally cruel to the lackeys.</p><p>“For millennia, the priests’ lackeys have been striving for their long-desired rule, all the while killing each other and hatching plots and schemes. They would even kill their fathers and brothers. This went on everywhere, in various countries, and not much has changed even now.</p><p>“This is the way the time of princes – which had long existed in other countries – began in Rus’, too. You’re aware of subsequent history. Now, too, retinues of guards are found far and wide and they all serve someone or other.</p><p>“The weaponry has changed and the equipment has, too, but the what’s at the core remains the same. And the evil deeds are not diminishing. There’s more and more of them, and they’re more refined.</p><p>“The elders made a mistake. Those of you who’ve come together to create a party – it’s up to you to not repeat their mistake.”</p><p>************************ Not Repeating the Mistake ************************</p><p>“What, exactly, was the elders’ mistake? Creating a retinue of guards made up of hired outsiders? But the way everything’s already evolved now, a state can’t exist without the military and an army.”</p><p>“The key to the mistake isn’t the retinues, Vladimir. It lies much deeper, in the mindset.</p><p>“I don’t know how to make it clearer – it lies in abandoning the forbears’ precepts as God’s precepts. Judge for yourself: God granted all people the same power. And consequently, the only social structure that can be perfect is one where no center of power exists. Where each person is endowed with equal power.</p><p>“When you give your voice away to someone else, you’re in fact not endowing anyone with power. Rather, you’re giving your voice away to a person and rendering it dependent on the system that’s evolved. And in doing so, you willingly divest yourself of your God-granted power. And over the centuries, a distorted mindset takes shape in a great number of people: the ruler and government should decide important questions for us. The thoughts of people like that don’t reflect the natural order of life.”</p><p>“So, are you saying, then, that we shouldn’t vote now? We won’t create a party that way. By law, voting is necessary.”</p><p>“If it’s necessary, then that means you vote for every person – not one person– to be able to control his life.”</p><p>“If you’re talking about veche meetings, like they had in Vedic Russian, then that’s totally impossible. The people can’t constantly be assembling for meetings at various ends of the country. And besides, they might not register a party like that.”</p><p>“Why would they have to assemble? You put all the contraptions you have today to use for good. All those communications links and computers. And registration? That’s laughable for a party of the people’s majority. You yourselves will have to become the registrars.</p><p>“And what’s key in this question isn’t some registration or other. The main thing is not to allow the creation of a so-called power center. If, according to your law, some central apparatus really is essential, then everyone who works in it should be nothing but hired workers. And not have any access to money. In general, you shouldn’t concentrate the money in one spot.”</p><p>“But by law, the party’s central committee has to be elected.”</p><p>“Well, so go ahead and elect all the party’s members or all the foremen to it.”</p><p>“We have to give this some more thought. At first, when you said the party’s main goal was to bring love back into families, I got really livid. I thought you were making fun of me, that you wanted to make a laughing stock of me.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“But now… I’ve thought about this problem a lot and I’ve come to the conclusion that it really is not just one of the most important problems, but the most important. And we have to establish some concrete conditions to help people in their search for their soul mates, put on some special events. We have to bring the ancient Russian rites to the people. We have to get science working on solving these problems, and the culture and ideological propaganda, too. These questions need to be addressed on the government level. And it’s essential to judge how civilized this or that state is based on the number of happy, loving families there are living in it.”</p><p>“Congratulations.”</p><p>“On what?”</p><p>“On comprehending.”</p><p>“It’s too early</p><p> to congratulate me. I just can’t manage to formulate this objective in such a way that people won’t laugh at the charter or at me or at the future party…”</p><p>“Well, let them laugh.”</p><p>“What do you mean, let them laugh? If they start laughing, then I’ll be the only one in the party with that charter. And there’ll be an unregistered party with a ludicrous charter supported by only one person. A rank-and-file party member.”</p><p>“But why only one? Two. I’ll also support it. And we’ll save up some money and hire ourselves an executive secretary.”</p><p>“Are you serious? You mean you’ll join this party, too?”</p><p>“No. I’m not going to join it. Besides that, according to law, as you say, your law, they wouldn’t register me.</p><p>“I’ll support ‘The Family Party’ with all my heart from right here in the taiga.</p><p>“And as for the fact that there will be only two of us – well, that’s the way all great things have always begun, with just one person, not masses of people. It’s later on, after years have passed, that the human community will laugh, but not at you, and it will be happy laughter.”</p><p>“All right, I’ll give it a try. I’ll think some more about how to formulate it. And I’ll ask the readers to think about it, too.”</p><p>“Vladimir, you should ask Anastasia to tell you about the wedding rite in greater detail. After all, among the Vedic Russian people, it began from the moment of birth.”</p><p>“But how can a wedding rite begin from the moment a person is born?”</p><p>“The Vedic Russians considered the first birth to be not the birth of the body, but the spark of love. No one today in the world, perhaps, could show you that the way Anastasia can. As her to recreate a picture of the life of one Vedic Russian family.”</p><p>I’m not going to say how and where my meeting with Anastasia took place. I’ll immediately present what she told me about one Vedic Russian family’s attitude to love.</p><p>He who manages to grasp and feel the meaning hiding in their culture of love might be able to grasp the great wisdom and cosmicality of the Vedic Russian rites.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.209>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>9. The Creator's Great Gift</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>************************ A Child's Love ************************</p><p>Anastasia began her story about Vedic Russian rites connected to the Energy of Love with a kind of childlike delight and inspiration:</p><p>“The deeds of the Vedic Russians are an unbroken teaching. A great, jovial academy for learning to exist consciously.</p><p>“You can think of all the Vedic Russian holidays as a contest of wit and artfulness. You can speak of them as wise lessons for the young and a reminder for the grown-ups. But the Vedic Russians also carried out their work during the harvest days merrily, too. The work was filled with greater meaning than material creations possessed.</p><p>“Look, Vladimir, here it’s haying time. The clear day is splendid. At daybreak the entire settlement, from the tiny to the great, rushes to the hayfields. Look: one whole family is riding on two wagons. Only the old folks remained behind at home, so that the living creatures on the estate wouldn’t feel lonely.</p><p>“But the lads – the young boys – they’re riding on horseback, and the horses only have horse-collars, and the lads have long, long reins in their hands. Riding these horses, they’ll use the long reins to haul the hay shocks over to the haystacks.</p><p>“The middle-aged fellows carry their scythes on carts, blades up, and alongside them are their wives and their slightly older children, with rakes: they’ll rake the grass the menfolk mow.</p><p>“And there are tiny, tiny children riding in the carts, too. Why? Just because, just for fun, so they can socialize, have a romp, play a bit and watch the grown-ups.</p><p>“The people aren’t dressed in rags. Their shirts are white, and look: the women have woven flowers into their braids, and their dresses are embroidered. Why are they dressed that way, as if they were headed to a holiday celebration?</p><p>“The answer, Vladimir, is that they have no particular need to mow the hay. Each of them has his own stacks on his homestead. Of course, to have a few stacks for the community, as a reserve – that’s not a bad thing.</p><p>“But the most important – and unstated – reason for this communal activity, is for people to show themselves off through the work. To sneak a glance at others, and for the lads and the young maidens, to make each other’s acquaintance as they work alongside each other. That’s why the young folk from neighboring settlements are also happy to come to the haying.</p><p>“It’s begun. Look.</p><p>“The men who are mowing are walking, dignified, in a row. And not a single one of them should lag behind. Their wives are raking up yesterday’s grass for drying, and singing. The young folk are collecting the dry grass into shocks. The young folk who are a bit older are sweeping the stacks together.</p><p>“And do you see there – two lads are standing together atop the stack. One of them is eighteen years old, and the second is twenty, and they’re laying the hay that six maidens are giving them onto the stack.</p><p>“The lads have removed their shirts. Sweat is streaming down their bronze bodies. But they’re trying to keep up and not let the laughing girls below get the better of them.</p><p>“There are two atop the haystack, and there should be four maidens down below, but here are six of them – giggling and playful – and they’re trying to throw hay on the fellows from down below.</p><p>“The fellows’ father comes up to the haystack to give them a drink of water, and he takes in the whole situation in the blink of an eye. His sons, the two of them, are trying to keep up with those six. It wouldn’t be good for them to give up. The agile, giggling maids down below – perhaps two of them will be brides for the sons. The father gives the sons a drink and calls up to them:</p><p>“‘Hey there, Sons, you know, I’m tired of mowing. Maybe I’ll climb up and join you, help you out? Since there are six down below instead of four.’</p><p>“‘Why do that, Father?’ answered the elder without pausing in his work. ‘Brother and I are here, the two of us, and we haven’t even gotten warmed up yet.’</p><p>“‘I’m just about falling asleep,’ added the younger one, furtively wiping the sweat from his brow.</p><p>“Down below, the giggling girls took note of his actions, and one of them, accompanied by the others’ laughter, called out to him:</p><p>“‘Watch out, don’t get sopping wet when you fall asleep.’</p><p>“The satisfied father grinned and joined the mowers’ line that had formed once more.</p><p>“A procession of four steeds was moving toward the haystack from a distant meadow, and some young fellows were leading the steeds by the bridle.</p><p>“Radomir, the youngest, was the last in line leading a horse. He had just turned eight at the summer’s start, and he was going on nine. But the boy Radomir was mature beyond his years.</p><p>“Not only did he tower above his peers in height – he also caught on to science more swiftly than the others, and he was daring in game playing. And here, at the mowing, he was proud to have been given the same job the older children were doing. He just had to make sure he didn’t fall behind the older ones.</p><p>“He tried to swiftly wrap the reins around the hay shock all on his own, and the horse obeyed him. And although Radomir was walking last in the column, still, he moved along without falling behind.</p><p>“Just a little bit further off, near the grove, the younger children were romping. Glimpsing the procession of horses and hay shocks, they all raced toward them so they could take a ride on the hay shocks.</p><p>“The youngsters ran headlong, and only one little girl – she’d barely turned four –was falling behind. All of the children had already run up to the hay shocks. And she, to shorten her journey, decided out of despair to run straight across the swamp. The swamp had nearly dried out, but there were still large hillocks on it. The little lass hopped from hillock to hillock, and the horses hauling the hay shocks were nearly right alongside her. Then suddenly, as she tried to hop to the next hillock, the little lass flew off the hillock, and as she fell, she scraped her knee on a stick, and dirtied her dress and face in the muddy muck besides. She jumped up. She immediately plopped back down and howled loudly, in indignation.</p><p>“The last hay shock had passed by and was fading into the distance.</p><p>“The steadfast Radomir heard the child’s cry. He halted his horse, headed in the direction of the cry, toward the swamp. And he saw that a little girl had gotten all dirty and was sitting in the muck, wiping her tears all over her dirty face with her fist and howling with all her might.</p><p>“Radomir grasped the little girl under her arms, pulled her out of the muck, set her on a dry spot and inquired:</p><p>“‘Little one, why are you howling so bitterly?’</p><p>“She began explaining, sobbing uncontrollably:</p><p>“‘Running, I was running, I couldn’t catch up, and then I fell. All the hay shocks had left, I’d fallen behind. Now all the children are riding on the hay shocks, and I’m sitting in the muck.’</p><p>“‘Not everyone has gone off,’ replied Radomir. ‘I’m still here, and here’s my hay shock. If you’ll stop howling, I’ll take you for a ride on it. Only you’re such a totally dirty little thing. Come on now, enough, stop howling, you’ll make me deaf.’</p><p>“Radomir took hold of the hem of the little girl’s dress, brought one of dry spots on the dress up to her nose and said sternly:</p><p>“‘Come on now, then, blow your nose.’</p><p>“The little girl shrieked in surprise and quickly covered her nakedness with her hands, then blew her nose once and then twice and stopped crying. Radomir let go of the hem of her dress, cast a critical glance over the dirty, disheveled little girl and said:</p><p>“‘You know, just take your dress off altogether.’</p><p>“‘I won’t,’ she announced firmly.</p><p>“‘Go on, take it off. I’ll turn away. I’ll rinse your dirty dress in the lake,</p><p> and meanwhile you sit here in the grass. Here, take my shirt. It’ll reach down to your heels – my shirt will be longer than a dress on you.’</p><p>“Radomir rinsed the little girl’s dress in the lake and she, having wrapped herself up in his shirt, peered out from the grass.</p><p>“And suddenly a terrifying thought pierced the little girl sitting in the grass like an arrow. She remembered the words she’d overheard her grandfather say one day. He’d told her grandmother:</p><p>“‘A hugely indecent deed occurred in the neighboring settlement: a certain misfit lifted the hem of a maiden’s dress before the wedding.’</p><p>“‘He lifted the hem, that means he’s broken the maiden’s life,’ sighed the grandmother.</p><p>“The little girl decided that something of hers had to break, too, since this fellow she didn’t know had lifted the hem of her dress. She examined her little hands and feet, and although they were all in perfect order, and not broken, her fear didn’t disappear.</p><p>“If her grandfather and grandmother were of the opinion that something breaks when the hem of a dress is lifted, then that meant something of hers had to break.</p><p>“The little girl jumped up from the grass and shouted to Radomir, who was rinsing her little dress in the lake:</p><p>“‘You – you are an indecent misfit.’</p><p>“Radomir straightened up, turned toward the little girl standing in the grass in his shirt and asked:</p><p>“‘Why are you shouting again? I didn’t catch that, what is it you want?’</p><p>“‘I’m shouting at you. You’re an indecent misfit. You dared to lift the hem of a maiden’s dress before the wedding. You’ve broken all of her to pieces.’</p><p>“For a short while Radomir looked at the grubby little girl, then began to guffaw. When he’d had a good laugh, he said:</p><p>“‘You heard the song, but you got it wrong. Yes, it’s indecent to lift the hem of a maiden’s dress before the wedding. But I – I didn’t lift the hem of a maiden’s dress.’</p><p>“‘You did lift it, you did. I remember – you lifted the hem of my dress.’</p><p>“‘Yours I did lift,’ agreed Radomir, ‘but you know, you’re not a maiden.’</p><p>“‘Why am I not a maiden?’ the little girl asked in astonishment.</p><p>“‘Because all maidens have protuberances on their chest, and you don’t have them. Instead of a maiden’s chest you have two pimples you can barely see. That means you’re not a maiden.’</p><p>“‘So who am I, then?’ the little girl asked, confused.</p><p>“‘For now you’re still a little thing. And now, sit there in the grass, without talking. I don’t have time to chat with you.’</p><p>“He went back into the water once more, rinsed the dress, wrung it out, carefully spread it out on the grass and called the little girl.</p><p>“‘Go over to the water, you little thing, you need to get washed.’</p><p>“She meekly came up and quieted down, and he washed her. He said:</p><p>“‘Now let’s go to the hay shock, you’ll have a ride.’</p><p>“‘First give me my dress back,’ the little girl quietly requested.</p><p>“‘But it’s all wet. You keep my shirt on for the time being. I’ll take your dress along with me, and it’ll dry out by the time we get to the haystack, and you can change back into it there.’</p><p>“‘No, give me back my dress,’ the little girl insisted. ‘I’ll put it on, even though it’s wet. Let it dry on me.’</p><p>“‘Here you go, doll yourself up.’ Radomir held the dress out to her and headed for the horse.</p><p>“The little girl quickly donned the dress. She raced headlong and caught up with Radomir by the hay shock.</p><p>“‘Well, here I am,’ she said, out of breath. ‘Take your shirt.’</p><p>“‘Of course. You’re the bane of my existence. All the fellows are already coming back, and I’m messing around with you. Come on, climb on top.’</p><p>“He helped the little girl clamber up onto the hay shock. He took the horse by the bridle and they set off in the direction of the haystack.</p><p>“The little girl in the wet dress sat on the hay shock that was moving smoothly along, and she exulted. She was alone, not in twos and threes like everyone else. She was sitting alone on the hay shock. And you could see the happiness on her face, as if she’d suddenly become a goddess. Oh, if only her little friends could see the way she was riding on her own, not in a caravan. She was being driven, alone… She glanced at the way Radomir was leading the horse by the halter, and no more did she remove her eyes from his back. Her little child’s heart began to beat more strongly. She felt warmth flowing through her whole body. Of course, the little girl couldn’t understand it: she’d fallen in love.</p><p>“Ah, that child’s love! It’s the purest – a gift from God. Only why does it sometimes come early and disturb the children’s hearts? Why? What point is there to it, to early love? There turns out to be a great point to early love, and the Vedic Russians knew what that point was.</p><p>“When he’d come up to the haystack, Radomir walked back to the hay shock.</p><p>“‘Okay, climb on down. Don’t be afraid, I’ll catch you.’</p><p>“He caught the little lass as she jumped to him, lowered her down to the ground, and asked:</p><p>“‘Who do you belong to?’</p><p>“‘I’m from the neighboring settlement. I’m Lyubomila. My sister and I are visiting, we’re helping our brother,’ she answered.</p><p>“‘Well, then, go on off to your sister,’ Radomir replied, heading away. He didn’t even turn back toward the little girl, not even once.</p><p>“She stood there, watching and watching as he untied the reins from the hay shock, climbed up on a barrel, sprang onto his steed and galloped off for a new hay shock.”</p><p>************************ Love as a Full-Fledged Member of the Family ************************</p><p>“Little Lyubomilka returned home with her sister. Just then the family was gathering together to spend the evening. But Lyubomilka didn’t feel like sitting down to the table. Cuddling up to her grandmother, she asked:</p><p>“‘Granny, come out into the garden with me. I want to tell you and only you about something miraculous.’</p><p>“Hearing her request, her father objected: ‘It’s not fitting, little Daughter, to go off when the family is sitting down to the table. And to take Grandmother with you besides…’</p><p>“The father glanced at his daughter’s face and smiled. The Vedic Russians recognized the blessing of a child’s love. They were skilled at treating love kindly, at receiving it into the family as a heavenly gift, at not mocking love. They were skilled at respecting it.</p><p>“They valued the blessing of the great energy, and this is why the energy of Love would come to them with great joy.</p><p>“‘All right, you and Grandmother, go eat some berries there in the garden,’ said the father, as if he didn’t care at all.</p><p>“In the garden, in its furthest corner, Lyubomilka sat her granny down on a bench and immediately and excitedly began her story:</p><p>“‘Granny, there I was, at the haying, I was playing with my little friends. And they go running off to ride on the hay stocks. But I didn’t so very much feel like riding. I’m just walking along. And suddenly, such a handsome fellow, the kindest fellow, stops his horse and he comes up to me. Yes, Granny, just as close to me as I’m standing to you right now. So handsome and all totally kind. And he’s standing in front of me, and he says, ‘Little girl, I ask you, please do me the pleasure of …’ No, that isn’t how he said it. He said, ‘Little girl, I not only ask, I even implore you to do me the pleasure of riding a short while on my stock.’ And I took a ride. There you have it. Do you understand, Granny? Did something come to pass with him?’</p><p>“‘It came to pass with you, little granddaughter. What’s his name?’</p><p>“‘I don’t know. He didn’t say anything.’</p><p>“‘Lyubomilochka, why don’t you start by telling me everything? And try not to forget, how it all really went, tell the truth.’</p><p>“‘To tell the truth…,’ Lyubomilka lowered her eyes. ‘You want to know the truth? I fell into the muck, he washed my dress, then he gave me a ride on the shock, but what his name is – he didn’t tell me. Called me a little thing, and when he was walking away, he didn’t look in my direction, not even one little time,’ Lyubomilka told her grandmother and began to cry. She continued, through her tears:</p><p>“‘I kept on standing there, watching him ride away. Only he didn’t look at me a single time, didn’t tell me his name.’</p><p>“The Grandmother pulled her granddaughter close. She stroked her brown-haired head as if caressing the energy of Love within her. And she whispered to her, softly, like a prayer, ‘O, great energy from God. Help your granddaughter and grant her a blessing. Don’t burn her still little heart, not yet grown strong. Inspire her to the deed of co-creation.’</p><p>“And aloud, she said to Lyubomilka:</p><p>“‘Granddaugther, do you want that very fine fellow to look always and only at you?’</p><p>“‘Yes, Grandmother, I do want that! I do want that!’</p><p>“‘Then don’t let him lay eyes on you for three years.’</p><p>“‘Why?’</p><p>“‘He saw you in the mud, all dirty. Saw you as a crying, helpless little thing. That’s the image of you that remained in him. In three years’ time you’ll be more grown up, more beautiful and smarter, if you yourself make the effort.’</p><p>“‘I will make a really, really good effort. Only tell me, Granny, how do I make an effort?’</p><p>“‘I’ll tell you all the secrets, little Granddaughter. If you carry them out to the letter, then you’ll grow more beautiful than all the little flowers on earth, and people will be smitten with you. Then they won’t be choosing to love you – you will be the one doing the choosing.’</p><p>“‘Go on, Granny, tell me, then, and I’ll carry everything out, tell me quick,’ said little Lyubomilka, urging her grandmother on and impatiently worrying the hem of her dress.</p><p>“And slowly, solemnly, the grandmother imparted the following to her granddaughter:</p><p>“‘Every morning, you need to get up on the early side. You spend your mornings lolling about, doing whatever you please. Once you get up, run to the brook and wash yourself in the pure spring water. Upon returning home, eat a little bit of porridge. You, you’re always demanding sweet berries.’</p><p>“‘Grandmother, why should I make all these efforts</p><p> at home, if he’s not even going to see me? Not going to see me bathing in the brook and eating the porridge?’ Lyubomilka asked in surprise.</p><p>“‘Naturally, he won’t see these things. But your efforts will be reflected in you in the form of outer beauty. And the energy will appear inside you.’</p><p>“Lyubomilka tried to follow her grandmother’s advice. She didn’t always manage to do this, especially during the first year. But whenever that happened, her grandmother would sit down on her bed, first thing in the morning, and say, ‘If you don’t get up with the sun and run to the brook, then on this day you will not grow more beautiful.’</p><p>“And Lyubomilka would get up. When the second year rolled around, she’d grown accustomed to the regimen. In the morning, she would carry out the ablution routine with ease and would merrily eat her porridge.</p><p>“A mere few months remained until the three years specified by her grandmother were up. People from the various settlements were coming together at the kapishche for the fair. Carts full of people drove past the homestead on which Lyubomilka lived. Along with her older sister Ekaterina, Lyubomilka was looking at the people riding past. And suddenly one cart, turning off the road, drove up to the gates where the two girls were standing. And in it, in the cart that had driven up… Lyubomilka recognized him right away. Sitting amidst other people driving the horse, sat her beloved Radomir, who had grown older.</p><p>“The girl’s little heart skipped a beat when the cart pulled up to their gates and stopped.</p><p>“The oldest of all the men sitting there, most likely, the father, said:</p><p>“‘Greetings to you, maidens. Please give my best regards to your father and mother and all your elders. And we would be happy to have a bit of your kvas to drink. We forgot to bring ours along on the trip.’</p><p>“Lyubomilka raced straight into the house and cried:</p><p>“‘Best regards to you all. Now, where’s the pitcher? Where, oh where is it, that pitcher of kvas? Ah, yes, in the pantry, it’s chilled.’ And she tore off to the pantry and overturned a bucket that was standing by the door. And when she reappeared, she fired off a tongue twister to her grandparents: ‘Don’t fret, I’ll wipe up the water when I’m back.’</p><p>“Once she’d grabbed the pitcher, she ran up to the gates, stopped, caught her breath and, controlling her excitement, walked steadily out the fence gate and passed the older man the pitcher of kvas.</p><p>“While the father of the family drank the kvas, she looked and looked at Radomir, not taking her eyes off him for a second. But he was scrutinizing Ekaterina.</p><p>“When the pitcher was passed to him, he drank the remaining kvas from it, hopped down from the cart and held the pitcher out to Ekaterina, saying:</p><p>“‘Thank you. The sponge was made by gentle hands.’</p><p>“The wagon moved off into the distance. Lyubomilka followed it with her gaze, then ran off to the bench in the farthest corner of the garden, but she didn’t sit down. She fell onto the bench and began sobbing bitterly.</p><p>“‘Why are you so sad again, Lyubomilka?’ Her grandmother came over and sat down beside her.</p><p>“Through tears, Lyubomilka told her grandmother about what had happened:</p><p>“‘They drove up and asked for some kvas, and that young man was there, the one who’d given me the ride, three years ago, the ride on the hay shock. He’s grown even more handsome. I ran and brought some kvas in a pitcher. They all drank the kvas and praised it. He drank some, too, then gave the pitcher back to Ekaterina. Not to me, Granny, to her, to that home wrecker Ekaterina. And he said ‘thank you’ to her, not me. She, that mean bean pole, while I was off getting the kvas, she said something or other and looked at him. He looked at her, too, and smiled, even. My own sister – a home wrecker. She’s an old bean pole.’</p><p>“‘Now, why in the world are you upset at your sister? She is not the one at fault. You are.’</p><p>“‘But why am I at fault, Granny? What didn’t I create correctly?’</p><p>“‘Listen to me carefully. Your sister created embroidered flowers on the sleeves of her dress, and they’re very even. You also decided you wanted to do everything yourself, but the embroidery on your little dress turned out crooked.</p><p>“‘Besides that, your sister knows how to speak in verse, and she’s the best at singing the carols. You, on the other hand, want nothing to do with the sages: they teach you to read and write verse.</p><p>“‘Your chosen one is most likely an intelligent boy, able to appreciate beauty and intelligence.’</p><p>“‘Do I need to study for three more years, Granny?’</p><p>“‘Perhaps for three. But maybe even for five.’”</p><p>************************ True Love Can't Help but Find Its Response ************************</p><p>“Ten years passed. Radomir and his closest friend – who had the unusual name of Arga – were walking through the holiday fair.</p><p>“Arga knew how to create magnificent wood carvings and paint splendid pictures. He could sculpt clay figures that seemed alive. These talents had come down to him from his granddad, and from his father he’d gained his skill as a blacksmith. The long rows of wagons with all manner of eatables held little interest for the friends.</p><p>“Nor did the rows with all manner of implements or crockery attract the fellows’ attention. All in all, the most important thing at the fairs was not to acquire material things, no matter what they might be. The main thing was to mingle and meet people, to share one’s experiences.</p><p>“The young men decided to head to where they were getting ready for a colorful performance by visiting performers. Suddenly someone hailed them:</p><p>“‘Radomir! Arga! Have you seen it yet?’</p><p>“Radomir and Arga turned their heads in the direction of the call. Three young fellows from the friends’ settlement were standing a short distance away, discussing something in a lively fashion, and they gestured to the friends to join them.</p><p>“‘Have we seen what?’ Radomir asked, walking up to them.</p><p>“‘That extraordinary shirt. It’s made of plain cloth, and embroidered with some wondrous design. There’s probably some kind of hidden meaning in it,’ answered one of the three young men, and the second one corrected him:</p><p>“‘The shirt’s great, but she who’s selling it is far more beautiful. No fair in the whole region has known maidens like that.’</p><p>“‘And how can we get a look at this wonder?’ asked Arga.</p><p>“All five of them set off for the rows where accessories, splendid crafts and beautiful clothing were being sold.</p><p>“People were crowding around one of carts more than was usual. They were admiring an extraordinarily beautiful shirt hanging on a stick. The breeze rustled the fabric a bit and you could see how it differed from the usual shirts made of coarse linen – it was light and delicate. And the designs embroidered on the collar and sleeves were extraordinarily intricate.</p><p>“‘This design is the work of a great master,’ Arga said aloud, admiringly.</p><p>“‘What you mean, the design? Push your way through the crowd and take a look and see who’s next to that design,’ said a neighbor from their settlement.</p><p>“And when the friends skirted the other edge of the crowd and got close to the cart, they saw a maiden.</p><p>“A tight chestnut braid, eyes as blue as the sky. Arched brows, and a barely concealed smile on her lips. Her movements were fluid, but it was as if some kind of energy was flowing in them. You’d have a hard time tearing your gaze away from the maiden.</p><p>“‘She’s sharp tongued, too,’ the most grown up fellow said softly. ‘Oh, yeah, and she can speak in verse and spin a yarn.’</p><p>“‘She looks delicate, but she’s unscalable as a cliff,’ the second one added. ‘Say something to her.’</p><p>“‘I can’t,’ answered Radomir. ‘Feels like somebody knocked the wind out of me.’</p><p>“Arga addressed the maiden:</p><p>“‘Tell us, o maiden, might the marvelous shirt be your handiwork?’</p><p>“‘Yes, mine,’ answered the maiden, without raising her eyes. ‘Out of boredom I did weave it, to pass a winter’s eve. And at times embroidered early, at the first light, break of day.’</p><p>“‘What payment do you want for your work?’ inquired Arga, so he could hear the singing girl’s speech a bit longer.</p><p>“The maiden raised her eyes to the young men and it seemed as if she’d suddenly carried them all off to the heavenly heights. She let her gaze rest on Radomir for just a bit. And it was as if she’d dissolved the fellow in blue sky. He perceived what came afterwards as if he were in a foggy and unusual dream.</p><p>“‘A payment of what kind? I’ll share what’s on my mind.’ The beauty sitting in the cart went on: ‘Freely will I give this piece, but to only a man good as gold. None but a young fellow daring will receive it. As a memento of him, though, a trifle I ask – a young horsey, say.’</p><p>“‘What a beauty! A worthy reply. She’s a real handy woman!’ people could be heard exclaiming in the crowd. ‘A horsey, she says, why that’s nothing at all. That beauty – she doesn’t know much at all.’</p><p>“And so the exclamations continued, but the people in the crowd didn’t disperse. And suddenly the crowd split into two, down the middle.</p><p>“Arga was leading a young dun-colored stallion by the bridle. The steed was hot-mettled and unbroken. It stood there, prancing and bucking.</p><p>“‘Now there’s a horsey for you! That’s a wonder horse! Can the young fellow really have decided to give it away?’ whispered all in the crowd.</p><p>“Arga approached the cart and said:</p><p>“‘My father gave me this steed. To you, o beauty, I give him, in exchange for the shirt.’</p><p>‘Thank you,’ replied the tranquil maiden. ‘But I said, and the people did hear – the shirt I will not sell, I can only make a gift of it, to you, perhaps, or to a different young fellow.’</p><p>“‘Aha, our beauty’s gotten frightened. Of course, it’s a hot-mettled steed, not even every young fellow could handle it. She wanted a horsey, but she got more than she bargained for.’ Taunts floated up from the crowd. ‘She’ll have to give up the game. What can she do? Any person would steer clear – the steed’s</p><p>
 sorely high-mettled and unbroken.’</p><p>“The maiden smiled slyly, glanced at the crowd, and with unusual lightness, hopped off the wagon onto the ground.</p><p>“All the crowd’s exclamations immediately turned to silence. The maiden’s figure was beautiful, as if carved by a great artist. She stood before them all, in all her beauty, looked at the steed, a smile on her face, and took three steps toward Arga, as if she were swimming, just barely touching the earth.</p><p>“Out of surprise, Arga let go of the reins. The high-mettled stallion reared up on his hind legs. But the maiden’s hand succeeded in grabbing the reins.</p><p>“And what happened next… Next, to the amazement of the people standing in the crowd… With her left hand, the maiden deftly pinched the stallion’s nostrils. And, letting go the reins, she stroked the steed’s muzzle with her right hand. The high-mettled stallion suddenly quieted. She bent his head toward the ground. The stallion resisted ever so slightly, but bent toward the ground all the same. Lower, and lower… And suddenly the hot-mettled steed fell to his knees before the maiden.</p><p>“An old man, a horseman, came out of the crowd and said:</p><p>“‘Only the old sages – and not even all of them – can tame wild animals and steeds that way. But you – you are a young maiden. What is your name? Who do you belong to?’</p><p>“‘I am Lyubomila, from the neighboring settlement. And to whom do I belong? To no one. I am simply the daughter of my father. And there he is, coming along, my strict father.’</p><p>“‘If I were strict…” said the returning father. ‘What have you done here now, Lyubomilka?’</p><p>“‘Why, nothing at all. I was only playing a bit with the colt.’</p><p>“‘A bit? I see. Let the horse go. It’s time for us to be heading home…’”</p><p>************************ Love, Too, Was a Teacher in the Vedic Russian School ************************</p><p>“What exactly happened with Lyubomila during those years? Where did she suddenly learn to be wise and clever? In the Vedic Russian school.</p><p>“Everyone attended this school – from earliest childhood to great old age. They took exams each year. This school’s curriculum came together in bits and pieces beginning from the time of Creation and grew richer with the passing centuries. And wisdom was imparted gently. The lessons weren’t like they are these days in today’s schools.</p><p>“One day you told me, Vladimir, about one expression you have. In cases when a child has grown naughty and rude, when bad habits have appeared in him, then people say of him that he’s been educated on the streets, that he’s been turned loose.</p><p>“The Vedic Russians didn’t just blithely turn their children loose. They all knew: the system of celebrations and rites had been so precisely and skillfully thought through, that it captivated and drew all the children to be educated. It seemed like they were playing, but in actuality, they were being taught various sciences, on their own, often without grown-ups.</p><p>“Exams in the Vedic Russian school resembled a succession of festivities and merry games. The grown-ups used these to teach their children, and they themselves learned from the children, too.</p><p>“For example, there’s a holiday called Caroling. During the caroling the children would go around and sing ditties to all their neighbors. They would compose the verses and tunes themselves, and dance steps to go with them.</p><p>“The children would prepare their performances long before the start of the festivities, and with unfeigned interest, they would make inquiries, asking the grown-ups, in their families, each other and the sages how they could learn to compose better verses, how to sing and dance.</p><p>“Of course, not all children were equally capable. The ones who lagged behind the others in composition would beseech their parents to teach them. And on occasion, the parents would put their children’s striving for knowledge to good use, as a way to draw them to helping around the house.</p><p>“For example, a grandson is pestering his grandmother:</p><p>“‘Dear Granny, come on, read me some verses. Come on, please read me them, I beg you. I don’t want to be worse than all the others – my friends won’t take me to Caroling with them.’</p><p>“And the grandmother replies:</p><p>“‘I have a lot to do. You might help me, and then I’ll read you some verses this evening.’</p><p>“The child would help out enthusiastically, and then he’d listen to his grandmother closely, trying to commit all her verses or songs to memory, and he’d ask her to teach him some jigs. Then he’d ask his grandfather and his mother and his father to teach him even just a little something. And he was grateful to his parents when they’d offer him a lesson.</p><p>“Vladimir, compare this scene with a lesson in today’s schools – with a literature class, for example.</p><p>“You’re exactly right – you can’t compare them. From the time he was little, the Vedic Russian child would strive to become a poet.</p><p>“The system of merry festivities that the people of the Vedic Russian period had would help one come to understand the universe and teach children simple everyday wisdom.</p><p>“The sages were wandering teachers and sources of information about what went on in the world. Folk singers and bards would also remind people of the events from the past and foretell the future. And they would glorify the world of fine feelings or decry the unseemly.</p><p>“No one would force the children attend their lessons, which were continually being offered in each settlement. The thinking was, that each teacher himself should know how to draw a child’s attention to the story he was planning to impart about a given science.</p><p>“The sage-teachers refined these principles over the centuries.”</p><p>“But what if some sage-teacher, so he could engage the children, were to just play some game with them, instead of teaching them a science?”</p><p>“If something like that were to happen, then the sage would lose his standing as ‘sage.’ While chatting at home with their children, the parents would realize right away that their children were not being taught a science. News of this negative conduct could spread through other settlements, and a great number of settlements would ask the sage who had besmirched his honor to leave.</p><p>“Before love arose within her, little Lyubomilka did not aspire to attend the sages’ lessons or listen to the songs of the bards and the folk singers. Parents wouldn’t force their children to study under protest, but they might gently point them in the right direction if a suitable occasion arose.</p><p>“Love enveloped little Lyubomilka with its energy. When love appeared in a Vedic Russian family, they perceived it as a new family member sent from God to help them. And they knew how, by working in tandem with love, one can make a little girl’s life beautiful. And so Lyubomilka’s grandmother suggested she go study with the sages. Not to study just because, for who knows what reason, but with a goal – so she could become the very best one for her beloved. Lyubomilka agreed, and she decided that when the sage who taught how to sing songs with a beautiful voice came around, she and her little friends would go to him.</p><p>“But the sage she needed didn’t come around. Lyubomilka decided she’d pay a visit to the one who did come, just because. She went and began listening. The sage was talking about the purpose of various plants, about the aromas they gave off and about how one can heal a person with plants.</p><p>“‘What do I need with this? I don’t need it at all,’ Lyubomilka said to herself. ‘Everybody already knows how to heal. Mama, Grandmother, my sister – they all know that. And even if I end up knowing more about various herbs than anyone else, then how will my chosen one notice that? There’s no way he’ll notice.’</p><p>“And Lyubomilka listened to the sage, but without paying attention. She sat there on the log, just because, to keep her little friends company. Every once in a while she’d get up, walk a short distance away and wander around the glade. She was overjoyed when the sage completed his lecture and everyone was getting ready to go home.</p><p>“And suddenly the old sage addressed Lyubomilka:</p><p>“‘Tell me, little girl, did what I was saying not seem of interest to you?’</p><p>“‘I just don’t need it the tiniest bit for my secret business,’ little Lyubomilka quietly informed the sage.</p><p>“The sage teacher just smiled a bit. That insightful elder understood everything about little girls’ secret business, and he noted:</p><p>“‘Perhaps you’re right, little girl, and this knowledge is of no use to you at the present time. After all, you’re still just a little child. But it’s for the girls that I’m sharing it, telling them how to become the most beautiful and how to create a space of Love for their beloved. When he sees it, he will certainly want to find out who managed to create such great beauty. And he’ll delight in the one who reveals herself to him as its creator. And I also share with the maidens the secret of how to weave a crown and how to prepare an infusion for one’s beloved out of herbs, one you can bathe in of a morning, so that your body will smell like a flower. And I’ll also tell the maidens…’</p><p>“Little Lyubomilka listened to the elder, regretting more and more that she hadn’t gone to his talks. He’d been a guest in the village for more than a week. He’d told the maidens important secrets, and she didn’t know a thing about them. And Lyubomilka asked the elder:</p><p>“‘Will you be a guest here in our village for much longer?’</p><p>“‘I’ll be leaving in two days,’ the elder replied.</p><p>“‘In two days?’ The little girl wasn’t able to hide her disappointment. ‘In two days… Well, then, I entreat you, please spend the last two nights at our house.’</p><p>“‘I’ve been invited to others’ houses and have already agreed,’ answered the sage. “However, if you would like…’</p><p>“‘Yes, I really, really need to find out about the various herbs from you.’</p><p>“The old sage spent all the evenings conversing with love-struck Lyubomilka.</p><p>“The old man knew that love’s inspiration</p><p> would help the little girl grasp the heart of the science in the space of a day, and that a year wouldn’t suffice for others to do that. And as the sage was leaving, as Lyubomilka was walking him to the outskirts of the settlement, he said to the girl:</p><p>“‘After me, another sage will come to visit. He’ll speak of the stars, of the Moon in the sky, the Sun and of invisible worlds. Whoever is able to understand him will be able to light a guiding star in the sky for her chosen beloved, and that star will shine for them both for all eternity.</p><p>“‘Then another sage will come to visit, one who knows how to make the most headstrong of horses submissive to one’s beloved, turn him into his friend, and how to tame wild animals.</p><p>“‘And there’s a bard who’s supposed to come visit you, too. He knows how to write poetry and how to use your voice to offer up certain kinds of songs – so that many people will take a fancy, first to the voice, and then to all the person says. And he can teach you to dance.’</p><p>“‘Can you tell me, please, which sage should I go to?’ Lyubomilka suddenly asked the elder. ‘You know, I can’t spend all my time listening to sages.’</p><p>“Once again the old sage, shrewdly concealing his smile, answered the little girl in all seriousness:</p><p>“‘Yes, you’re right. If you go to them all, then you won’t have any time at all just for playing. Don’t go to them all. Why, for example, do you need to go learn to draw? To embroider patterns and imbue them with your own hidden meaning? What do you need with that science, if you have an older sister, and I think she will be a master of that science without rival?</p><p>“‘And besides that, why do you need, for example, to go study and learn how you can place kind feelings into a shirt as you sew it, and then that shirt will protect the wearer from many misfortunes?</p><p>“‘How you can prepare kasha for your dear ones with love, and it will nourish not just their body, but their soul as well. The flavor of that kasha will be unsurpassed. And the neighbor girl, your sister’s friend – she can do that to perfection.</p><p>“‘When you want to get a pretty dress or offer someone the gift of an unusual shirt, and want everyone to admire the gift, then ask your sister, and she’ll create marvelous creations.</p><p>“‘And if you want to treat someone to some kasha or uncommon kvas, ask your sister’s friend.’</p><p>“‘I’m not going to ask anyone,’ Lyubomilka suddenly blurted out, forgetting herself, and she even stamped her foot. ‘They’re my rivals.’</p><p>“‘Rivals? In what way?’ asked the elder seriously.</p><p>“‘There’s a boy – he’s the best of all, and he doesn’t pay any attention to me, because those bean poles managed to grow up before I did. They’re always smiling at him. I saw it when they were dancing the reels at the kapishche. And now I’m supposed to give him a shirt from my sister, and her friend’s kvas?! I can’t let that happen! Never!’</p><p>“‘But why can’t you let that happen? You say he’s the best of all the boys.’</p><p>“‘The best. I know that for sure.’</p><p>“‘Then tell me this: why shouldn’t the best one of all receive a gift of the best shirt, and the best kasha, and kvas? And...’ The old sage paused and quietly, as if talking to himself, added, ‘I think it would be fair for him to receive the best bride of all, too.’</p><p>“‘Bride?” Lyubomilka asked, blushing.</p><p>“‘Yes, bride,’ the sage answered. ‘After all, you should wish him only good things. Let his bride be the best of all.’</p><p>“Lyubomilka looked at the sage and couldn’t find a single word to say. Emotions overwhelmed and stung her. And suddenly she ran away from the sage. But, after running a bit, she stopped, turned toward the wise sage and cried:</p><p>“‘He deserves the best bride of all. I’ll be that bride!’</p><p>“Lyubomilka took great interest in visiting each sage who came to the settlement. She was the first one to come running for the talk, and the last to leave, and she astonished the sages with her questions. She remembered everything the sages said. The learning process can be like that only when a child attends lessons not just because, but when she knows for sure how she’ll apply the knowledge she gains.</p><p>“When learning is onerous for the student, it’s unproductive. When a person has a goal that can be reached by grasping various sciences, then learning is a joy and mastery is gained a hundred times more quickly.</p><p>“And when love takes part in the learning, too, it has an unparalleled effect. Love is capable of reading the thought of any sage, and just a few words uttered by the teacher are enough for love to be able to explain the entire topic to a student in one instant and lead his thought further along.</p><p>“The gift of God – the great energy, love – is what was most important in Lyubomilka’s learning process.</p><p>“At home, too, the little girl would watch her mama and grandmother with uncommon interest, watch the way they prepared lunch for the family. And she’d demand they explain everything they did in detail, and she’d try creating various dishes herself. And the little one would come up with uncommon creations.</p><p>“One day during Butter Week, relatives came for pancakes. A great number of people were coming up to the table and taking pancakes from two stacks. The mother and grandmother had made one stack, and little Lyubomilka had made the other. Her pancakes were more to the guests’ liking than the others. And the little girl watched joyfully from the far corner, seeing her stack of pancakes dwindling more quickly than the others.</p><p>“When the whole family would sit down at the table upon a weekday, her grandfather would be the first to scoop up some cabbage soup with a wooden spoon. And he would say:</p><p>“I know full well who prepared this dish. Its pleasant, delicate flavor has no rival.’</p><p>“‘So true,’ her father would add. ‘There’s not just a cluster of uncommon herbs in it – there’s feeling in it.’</p><p>“Little Lyubomilka grasped the sciences easily, became an unrivaled seamstress, and on the outside, blossomed with an uncommon beauty.</p><p>“Without knowing it herself, she had grasped the great truth of love from the first sage. If you want to be at God’s side – become a goddess yourself.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.210>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>10. Pre-Marriage Revelries</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“The children had grown up. The time had come to search for their beloveds. The revelries were created to help the young folks in this important endeavor.</p><p>“The young Vedic Russians would often gather together in the evenings at an agreed upon spot, usually on the outskirts of the settlement. They’d light bonfires, chat amongst themselves or sing songs. And once a week all three or four settlements would come together at the same time in a favorite spot and revel out in the open air. At this revelry for all they’d also light bonfires and sing songs and chat amongst themselves. But there were the merry games, too, ones that could help in the search for one’s beloved.</p><p>“They look simple on the surface, but great significance lay within that simplicity.”</p><p>************************ "Thread the Needle (The Streamlet)" ************************</p><p>“For example, there was this game. The young people would line up in pairs one behind the other, take each other’s hands and raise their arms above them. First a young man would stand with another young man, and a maiden with another maiden. The ones who were unable to pair up or who were first in line would go to the end of the ‘streamlet’ and bow. Then they’d pass beneath the raised arms to the head of the ‘streamlet’.</p><p>“When someone was passing through the ‘streamlet,’ he wasn’t allowed to look up. He’d choose a temporary partner for himself by slapping someone’s hand at random. Whoever happened to be chosen would follow the slapper, and the two of them would get in line together at the front of the line of all the couples. The person who’d lost his partner would go to the end of the column and choose himself a partner once again.</p><p>“A simple game, but you can see for yourself, Vladimir: when they’d take each others’ hands for the first time, the young folk were able to convey no small measure of feelings to each other, without any words. An acknowledgement, gratitude and love or, conversely, rejection. As the game progressed, the couples changed, and it was easy to compare whose hand was the most pleasing of all to you.</p><p>************************ "Ditty-Prattle" ************************</p><p>“This is a most ancient game, and it’s much more complex than all the other merry game. Today’s ditties, the ones people still sing today, came from this game.</p><p>“And here’s what the ancient marriage game ‘ditty-prattle’ consisted of. Two columns would stand opposite each other. One consisted of young fellows, and maidens made up the second. The last girl in the column would bestow a four-line ditty upon the last young fellow standing across from her in the men’s column. And as she performed it, she’d also do a little dance. Once the performance of the ditty was complete, the remaining girls would swiftly stamp twice, clap thrice. And, if the fellow standing across from her was unable to call a worthy reply up out of his memory within this time, then the girl would sing a new ditty, but this time, to the next fellow standing in the men’s column.</p><p>“Were the young man to find a worthy reply in time, they would continue to converse using witty ditties. But that rarely happened.</p><p>“Young Vedic Russians knew a great number of verses, but even so, not every one was able to call up a worthy reply within a short time, especially since the stamping, clapping rivals off to the side would try to hinder him in every way possible.</p><p>“Lyubomilka appeared at one of the gatherings of young folk from various settlements. Five of Radomir’s friends who’d seen the extraordinary girl at the fair were stealing glances at her. Radomir’s closest friend, Arga, didn’t</p><p> take his eyes off the maiden for even a moment.</p><p>“When the ‘thread the needle’ game began, Radomir – usually bold and decisive – was walking beneath the arms of the couples standing there, fully intending to take Lyubomilka’s hand and become her partner. But suddenly he chickened out. As he walked, bent over between the couples, he sensed her. He’d have sensed her even with his eyes closed. But as he came closer to Lyubomilka, who was standing paired up with a girlfriend, he only slowed his pace, and then walked on, as if in a dream, having taken the hand of some young fellow from a neighboring settlement.</p><p>“But his friend Arga turned out to be more decisive. When his turn came to walk along the ‘streamlet,’ Arga walked to Lyubomilka, took her hand and took his spot with the extraordinary maiden at the head of the couples standing there, much to the envy of all the other young fellows.</p><p>“Then he was pestered with questions:</p><p>“‘How did she hold your hand? Did she squeeze it, or was she casual?’</p><p>“‘I don’t know,’ Arga replied. ‘I don’t remember a thing. Seems to me my hand was on fire. Feel it – it still seems hot, even now.’</p><p>“‘Now that’s a maiden!’ the young fellows said in amazement. ‘She’s passionate, too, as if some flame was burning within her, blazing with a secret fire.’</p><p>“Radomir heard all of this, and said nothing. A fire had long been blazing within him. Right from the moment when he’d first glimpsed the wondrous girl at the fair. As soon as he awoke, he would think of her, ceaselessly. She would appear to him in his dreams, too, but he was unable to touch her, even in his dreams.</p><p>“Always successful in his endeavors, Radomir was known as a poet, but when it came to her, he couldn’t find even simple words to assess her.</p><p>“When the ‘ditty-prattle’ game began, he was standing in the middle of the line of young fellows, next to his friend Arga. Lyubomilka was just a bit in from the end of the girls’ line. When her turn came to sing the ditty-prattles and to dance, she began singing them with ease. And right then and there it became clear to everyone that it would be impossible to get the better of the extraordinary maiden.</p><p>“She would change the topic abruptly, and sing couplets never heard before. She claimed victory over one young fellow after another, although she herself was younger than them all.</p><p>“When it was Arga’s turn, he did manage to reply to the mischievous maid: even though there was a bit of a hitch, he replied to Lyubomilka with one quatrain, but immediately, without waiting for the stamps and claps, she unexpectedly changed the topic and bantered so fluently with the new verses that Arga, having lost his bearings, didn’t even attempt to counter her with verses of his own.</p><p>“Radomir was next. Lyubomilka sang to him, jauntily dancing to match the rhythm of her verses:</p><p>“‘Brave and glib you are, fine lad – you’ve come to know a lot. But did you forget, how in the lake, you washed from my dress a spot?’</p><p>“Someone laughed, thinking Lyubomilka’s couplet a joke. Another person, like Radomir himself, didn’t understand what she was talking about. And if you don’t understand, then it’s impossible to offer a reply.</p><p>“And Radomir was unable to say anything to Lyubomilka by way of reply. When the stamps and claps that marked the time allotted for preparing a reply were finished, he realized that his time was slipping away, and he wouldn’t be able to get it back. He couldn’t allow that to happen. As if in a fog, he took one step toward Lyubomilka, then a second and a third. He walked close, close up to her. Not understanding why the rules of the game had been violated, no one said anything.</p><p>“Radomir stood silently across from Lyubomilka. And suddenly everyone standing in the lines heard Radomir pronounce, amidst the silence, in everyone’s presence, his voice quavering, the Vedic Russian declaration of love:</p><p>“‘With you, o beautiful goddess, I could create a space of Love for all eternity.’</p><p>“Everyone waited in silence, wondering what sharp-tongued answer the ball of fire-maiden would give.</p><p>“Suddenly she grew timid. At first she self-consciously lowered the gaze of her fiery eyes, then raised them. Teardrops were flowing from her eyes, and she whispered:</p><p>“‘I am prepared to help you in the great co-creation.’</p><p>“Radomir recognized in the maiden that little girl, whose dress he had washed in the lake when he was a child. He recognized her and took her by the hand. They set off together, the two of them, no longer even seeing anyone else. The two lines stood opposite each other in silence, and their gaze followed the love that was heading into eternity.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.211>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>11. The Rite of Marriage</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“Vladimir, you already know the Vedic Russian rite of marriage and have written of it in ‘The Family Book.’ I’ll remind you of the essence of the great events.</p><p>“It was up to the beloveds to jointly choose a spot for their future homestead. Usually, they would go together to the outskirts of the settlement where he lived with his parents and then near the settlement where she lived. And there was no need for the beloveds to inform their parents of their intentions. Each person in the settlements, without being told, understood and knew and understood the task that lay ahead.</p><p>“On the parcel of land they chose, a hectare or more in size, the beloveds would design their actual life together. Their task was to mentally design a house and set out a great number of plants, so that they would all work together and help each other.</p><p>“Lyubomila and Radomir quickly found a spot for their future homestead. As if they’d already agreed on it, they headed out to the outskirts of the settlement, where there was a small glade in the woods, where a barely noticeable streamlet flowed from a small spring.</p><p>“Radomir had spent time here before. He would sit here alone, dreaming of the future, of life with his beloved.</p><p>“Lyubomila had twice ridden past this spot on her trusty quarter horse in Radomir’s absence. One day, without even knowing why herself, she halted her steed by the streamlet, made her way to the glade, unplaited her braid, retied her hair with a ribbon and spent a long time standing by a young birch tree.</p><p>“Now the beloveds were standing in that spot together.</p><p>“‘I used to like being here on my own,’ Radomir said. ‘I would like our family line to continue here.’</p><p>“‘This spot is to my liking, too,’ whispered Lyubomila.</p><p>“The next day, as soon as daybreak dawned, Radomir brought about a dozen and a half poles to the chosen spot in a cart – long willow canes and small stakes – and a scythe. As soon as he began mowing the grass, he saw Lyubomila racing toward him on her galloping steed. Radomir delighted in this vision – his heart skipped a beat. The beauty, racing to within three meters of the as yet invisible border of their plot, jumped from her still moving steed and ran up to Radomir.</p><p>“‘Good dawning day to you, o creator,’ Lyubomila said to Radomir, smiling. ‘The day is off to a good start, and I decided to bring colored ribbons to mark the spots of our future plantings.’</p><p>“‘Thank you for adorning the day,’ replied Radomir.</p><p>“The beloveds didn’t embrace and didn’t kiss. It wasn’t customary for Vedic Russians to do that sort of thing before they were married. And there was great significance to this: they didn’t turn their embraces and kisses into something commonplace before children were conceived. And for that reason, when the moment of conception occurred, their energy was at its highest point. And they would never make dates to see each other.</p><p>“Each of them would go to the chosen spot himself when he himself felt like it.</p><p>“Radomir was always the first to come, at dawn each day, and Lyubomila would appear after him on her steed.</p><p>“After a week, Radomir built a hut that resembled a little fairy-tale house. Two and a half meters wide and three meters long. He poked the poles into the ground and made walls out of woven branches and made a roof of poles and branches.</p><p>“The beloveds covered all of this over with dried grass, and inside, Lyubomila covered all the walls and the ceiling with linen cloth. And she made two beds: she laid down straw, with hay atop it, and covered the bed with linen.</p><p>“When the little fairy-tale house had been built, the beloveds would often spend the night in it, but they did not enter into intimate relations. That kind of intimacy – before the wedding, before the creation of the nest – was considered an affront to the future children.</p><p>“Besides, the beloveds had plenty to keep them busy. Radomir brought around a wide plank and drew up a diagram of their plot of land using a chisel. He indicated the cardinal directions and noted the Sun’s rising and setting, and the Moon’s ascent. And as well, during the day and night, he’d record the force of the wind and its direction on the diagram.</p><p>“Lyubomila would often go over to the edges of the plot and stand there for a long time, painting pictures in her imagination showing the future plantings, and then she’d go over to Radomir’s diagram and check to make sure that no wind or shade would harm them.</p><p>“When winter came, Lyubomila visited the domain of love less often. She was weaving fabric in her parents’ house and lovingly embroidering a shirt for Radomir.</p><p>“But Radomir often came to the future homestead, measuring the movement of the winds as he’d done before and noting the way the snow would settle.</p><p>“That’s the way the Vedic Russians would create their weather calendar from year to year. There were planks with those kinds of diagrams in each Vedic Russian family, and they could accurately predict the weather a year – and even two or three – in advance. It would seem simpler to go and make a similar calendar based on your parents’, but it wouldn’t be</p><p> entirely accurate. Each locale’s terrain was slightly different, and a hill or a grove might shield the plants from a breeze. The winter snowdrifts might differ.</p><p>“When springtime came, the design had been completed in Radomir’s thoughts, and in Lyubomila’s, too, and in early spring they once again began living together in their little house. Now the task that lay before them was to mark all the plantings with the beribboned stakes and branches and come to an agreement with each other regarding the design. And Radomir had to dig a well and enclose the springlet.</p><p>“Two weeks remained before they’d be able to plant seedlings in the ground, and the beloveds began preparing for their wedding.</p><p>“First they went to the settlement where the groom lived, then to the bride’s village. And they would stop in at each house and invite those who lived there to the wedding. Their arrival was eagerly awaited in each house. Everyone wanted to lay eyes on their love and determine what gift to give them for their future living home. When the young couple would visit a garden, a farmyard, or a house, they said but a few words to those who lived there. Just one phrase to each family. For example, something like this: ‘Oh, your apple tree is so beautiful,’ or ‘That kitten has an intelligent gaze,’ or ‘Your bear’s a good worker with a light touch.’</p><p>“For each person who heard the beloveds praise a tree growing in his garden or the kitten that lived with them, that praise indicated both their recognition of the residents’ worthy life and also that they, too, would like to have that kind of plant or animal.</p><p>“The residents didn’t invite the young couple into the house or serve them any food or drink. There was a reason the Vedic Russians had set things up that way: after all, it would be inconsiderate of the young couple to refuse an invitation or refreshment, but if they were to linger on their visits, they wouldn’t have time to go around to all the families before the wedding.</p><p>“Arga, Radomir’s childhood friend, broke the rules a bit. When the beloveds came into the house and began speaking with Arga’s father, Arga suddenly ran out and led out from its stall a wonder-stallion the whole settlement admired. He began speaking excitedly:</p><p>“‘Please accept this steed from me. He still won’t let anyone near him, ever since Lyubomila tamed him at the fair.’</p><p>“The father looked slyly at his son and said:</p><p>“‘Perhaps it’s you, Arga, who won’t let anyone near the steed to break him in? And for some reason you haven’t broken him in yourself.’</p><p>“A bit embarrassed, Arga replied:</p><p>“‘I haven’t broken him in – I made a decision to let this stallion always be free, and now I’ve changed my mind. Take the steed from me.’ And he held the reins out to Lyubomila.</p><p>“‘Thank you,’ Lyubomila replied. ‘I can’t accept the steed. He’s grown accustomed to another, but if he were to sire a colt, we would gratefully accept it.’</p><p>“When the young couple had made the rounds of the homesteads and the day they had set arrived, young and old alike from the two settlements hurried to the plot of land at first light.</p><p>“People took their places along the border of the plot of land, which the young couple had marked with dried branches. And in the middle, next to the hut, rising up above the ground, was a little hill, decorated with flowers. Radomir ascended the hill and, full of excitement, presented the design of the future homestead to those who had gathered.</p><p>“And each time the young man indicated a spot where this or that plant should grow, one person would step forward from the circle of people attending his words and go stand on the spot Radomir had indicated. And the person who had stepped forward would be holding in his hands a seedling of the type of plant Radomir had named. And the people would bow to each person who stepped out from the circle – for he, who stepped forward had earned the young couple’s praise when they were making the rounds of the homesteads because he had been able to grow something beautiful. And that meant that he, who stepped forward had earned the praise of the Creator, of the Father of everything, of God who loves all.</p><p>“When he’d finished presenting the plan, Radomir came down from the hillock and went over to where his Lyubomila stood, excitedly and tremorously watching all that was happening. He took her by the hand and solemnly led her up onto the rise. Now the beloveds were standing together on the rise.</p><p>“And Radomir spoke these words before all:</p><p>“‘I did not create a space of Love here on my own. Right beside me and before you, o people, stands my beautiful inspiration.’</p><p>“At first, the girl – although it would be better to call her a maiden – lowered her eyes before everyone.</p><p>“Every woman possesses her own kind of beauty. But there can be moments in the life of each woman when she rises above all others. There are no such moments in today’s culture. But back then…</p><p>“And now Lyubomila directed her gaze toward the people.</p><p>“The delight of all the people standing before her united into a single exclamation. A smile – not impudent, but bold – shone on the girl’s countenance. The energy of Love filled her to overflowing. A blush, stronger than usual, played upon her cheeks. The maiden’s body, glowing with health, and the brightness of her eyes enveloped the people and everything in the space around them. For an instant, everything around stood motionless.</p><p>“Before the people shone a young goddess, in all her beauty. The marveling people delighted in the vision.</p><p>“And that’s why some time passed before the maiden’s parents, along with the elderly and young members of the whole family, solemnly made their way to the hillock where the beloveds were standing.</p><p>“Stopping at the hillock, first the family bowed to the young couple, and then the mother asked her maiden-daughter:</p><p>“‘All the wisdom of our family line lies within you. Tell us, o daughter of mine, do you see the future of the land you have chosen?’</p><p>“‘Yes, Mama, I see it,’ Lyubomila replied.</p><p>“‘Tell me, o daughter of mine,’ continued the mother, ‘is all of the future that’s been shown pleasing to you?’</p><p>“‘The plan that’s been laid out is pleasing to my soul. But all the same, I wish to add a little bit of something of my own.’</p><p>“Hopping down quickly from the hillock, Lyubomila suddenly ran between the people to the edge of the future garden. She stopped and spoke:</p><p>“‘Here a tree with needle-shaped leaves should grow, and next to it – a birch. When a breeze blows from that direction, it will encounter the pine branches, and then the birch’s, and then the breeze will ask the branches of the trees to sing a melody. The song will never, ever, be exactly the same, but each time it will be a delight for the soul. And here…’ the maiden ran a bit off to the side, ‘… and here flowers should grow. Let a red color blaze up first, and here, a bit later – purple, and here – burgundy.’</p><p>“Lyubomila, all flushed, danced through the future garden as if she was a fairy. And once again, the remaining people who were standing in the circle bestirred themselves, rushing as they bore seeds in their hands to the points on the land designated by the ardent girl.</p><p>“Concluding her dance, she ran once again up to the hillock and, taking her spot alongside her chosen one, spoke:</p><p>“‘Now the space here will be beautiful. The earth will grow a marvelous picture.’</p><p>“The mother addressed the maiden once more, saying, ’O, daughter of mine, tell all the people: who will serve as the crown for everything, the crown above this most beautiful space? From among all people living on earth, onto whose head could you place the crown with your hand?’</p><p>“And, turning to her groom, the bride answered:</p><p>“‘He whose thought is capable of creating a future of beauty – he is worthy to accept the crown.’ And with her hand, she touched the shoulder of her beloved, who was standing beside her. He went down before her onto one knee. And the girl solemnly laid atop his head a beautiful crown, which she had woven of aromatic herbs and flowers with her very own hands. Then, after running her right hand three times over the crowned one’s hair, she took her left hand and bowed his head slightly toward her. Then Radomir, now crowned, rose from the kneeling position. And Lyubomila came down off the hillock and bent her head before him ever so slightly in a sign of submissiveness.</p><p>“Now, as was the custom, the young man’s father and his whole family approached the hillock. Once they were there, they halted, out of respect, and the father asked his son, crowned now, and rising above everyone:</p><p>“‘Who are you, and whose thought is capable of co-creating a space of Love?’</p><p>“And Radomir gave his reply:</p><p>“‘I am your son, and son of the Creator.’</p><p>“‘A crown – the herald of a great mission – has been placed upon you. What will you do, o you crowned one, now that you rule your space?’</p><p>“‘I will co-create a beautiful future,’ came the answer.</p><p>“And once again the father inquired:</p><p>“‘Where will you acquire strength and inspiration, o my son and crowned son of the Creator?’</p><p>“‘In love!’</p><p>“And again a question came:</p><p>“‘The energy of Love might wander throughout the entire Universe. How will you be able to glimpse the reflection of the Universe’s love on earth?’</p><p>“‘There is one girl, Father, and for me she is the reflection of the energy of the Universe’s Love on Earth.’ And with these words, he went down to Lyubomila and, taking her by the hand, ascended the rise once more.</p><p>“And the two families flowed together into one united group, and they were all embracing and joking and laughing.</p><p>“Then the young man thanked each and every one, and everyone began planting their living gifts in the spots he had shown them earlier.</p><p>“Those who had not been shown any spot for planting walked along the plot’s border that had been previously marked out and, singing a circle dance song, they cast the seeds they’d brought along</p><p> with them into the ground. Only a few minutes passed, but a splendid garden was planted. And the crowned young man once again extended his hand upward, and in the silence he said:</p><p>“‘May the creatures given by the Creator to man live alongside us in friendship.’</p><p>“And those who had readied animals as gifts for them came up to the hut, bearing in their arms a kitten or a puppy, or leading a calf or bear cub on a lead. Radomir’s friend Arga made them a gift of the colt he’d promised.</p><p>“After this, they quickly used wattle fences to connect a pen for the animals to the hut. And before long the young couple’s temporary dwelling was overflowing with animals, themselves young. And great significance lay in this: being all mixed in amongst each other, they would forever live in harmony, care for and help each other.</p><p>“Once they’d accepted the gifts, the young couple thanked everyone. Following this, as was the custom, a joyous revelry began, complete with circle dances and songs. But the young couple – and their relatives, too – headed off to their own homes. Now they would not see each other for two nights and a day.</p><p>“In this time the best master craftsmen from the two settlements moved the log home frame they’d made beforehand to the homestead, laid the roof and the wooden floor and sealed all the chinks with moss and grasses. And the women placed all the best fruits in that new house. The two mothers covered the bed with a linen coverlet. And when the second night came, all the people left the homestead. The energy of Love was hovering above it, awaiting the young beloveds.”</p><p>“Look what we have here, Vladimir. A Vedic Russian family – in this case, little Lyubomila’s family – perceived the feeling of love that appeared in the little girl as a gift of God and treated the appearance of this feeling the way they’d treat a new member of the family, sent by God to be a helper in the little girl’s education. Or perhaps to be her main teacher. As a result, the grandmother helped the little girl understand what the great energy of Love wanted of her, and she directed the child toward concrete actions, using a simple language the child could understand.</p><p>“Full of inspiration, the little girl began to come to know the sciences, the wisdom of existence; she improved her own spirit and body.</p><p>“Who played the most important role in Lyubomila’s success? Her grandmother, the wise teacher-sages, the little girl herself, or the great, tireless energy of Love?”</p><p>“I think that if you take away the efforts of the energy of Love, then all the others who took part in the little girl’s education would have been hard pressed to achieve even half as much. But if not for them, then it’s unlikely the energy of Love could have set the little girl on the right path all on its own.”</p><p>“Which means that there came to pass co-creation, and joy for all who beheld it. And this is precisely what God wants of man.”</p><p>“I agree. The rite of marriage itself – really, it’s a masterpiece of a celebration, unsurpassed in its beauty and significance and wisdom. If you compare it to today’s rites of marriage, then it ends up that we’ve turned into occult idiots. What’s left for the young couple after a wedding today? Memories of taking a drive in a car to go – who knows why – to the ‘eternal flame,’ drunken carousing in a café or restaurant, cries of ‘Bitter’ and public kisses that squander the energy meant to be used to conceive a child.</p><p>“After the Vedic Russian rite of marriage, the young couple is left not with memories, but with a very real house that was joyfully built for them by the best master craftsmen, a garden with a multitude of plants set out by the hands of relatives, friends and neighbors according to the young beloveds’ design.”</p><p>“In fact, what they’re left with is a genuine space of Love. A holy, genuinely Divine, living nest where a child will subsequently be conceived.</p><p>“At the Vedic Russian rite, it isn’t two friends who serve as witnesses, as is done now, but all the relatives, the whole neighborhood, and they affix their signatures not on some scrap of paper, but rather on the land, in the form of living creation.</p><p>“The young couple, for their part, are taking a test together when, before the entire settlement, they tell about the design of their future family homestead. I think that what they present is immeasurably loftier than today’s doctoral dissertations.</p><p>“Of course, the materialization of the living space, the house, the farm, and the beauty of the actions through which they’re created – without a doubt, those are an important factor. But one other incredible feature is no less important: look at who crowns the young couple. Not the parents, not some random person from the Marriage Bureau or a priest whom they often are seeing for the first and last time.</p><p>“Lyubomila crowns Radomir herself! She places the crown on his head in the presence of all those who have assembled. Children of God really and truly are capable of performing such an act. This psychological factor is not as straightforward as it might seem at first glance.</p><p>“A person who allows some chance people to register his love is already on the subconscious level absolving himself of responsibility for the subsequent fate of the family. Lyubomila is doing the opposite – she’s placing it onto herself.</p><p>“Many conventionalities stand between many newlyweds today who register their marriages, and God. These include both the parents’ blessing and registration at the Marriage Bureau, and the priest in the church. There was no one between Vedic Russian newlyweds and God. Hence, only God himself could bless their marriage.</p><p>“And He actually does this in the form of a genuine manifestation, even before the placing of the crown. He sends them mutual love. The Vedic Russians knew how to accept it and how to make it eternal.</p><p>“But what went on before conception in the Vedic Russian period of people’s lives?”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.212>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>12. Conception</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“The rite of marriage had occurred. But the young couple doesn’t jump right into bed to perform the well-known acts on their first wedding night after tying one on at the wedding. Their relatives don’t force them to go to bed and then display a bloody sheet to everyone present at the wedding, as was done in many rites of marriage, especially in the Caucasus.</p><p>“The young beloveds go off, each to his parents’ house. They sleep and make their ablutions. And great significance lies within this event.</p><p>“All the excitement connected to presenting the homestead design passes. The excitement connected to the wedding itself, where they were completely preoccupied with each other and were at a peak – a peak of pleasant sensations, to be sure, but all the same, at a peak of nervous tension.</p><p>“They have a rest and get a good sleep at their parents’ house, while, naturally, thinking of each other.</p><p>“Two days later comes their first meeting as husband and wife. And by the time this moment comes, everything has been readied for their child’s conception. This doesn’t have to do just with material goods. The house, a warm enclosure for the animals, and the kitchen garden and the garden are important, of course. But the young couple’s emotional and physical state is just as important.</p><p>“Radomir awoke before dawn. And without waking anyone, he put on his crown and took along with him the shirt his mother had embroidered. He ran to the brook that was fed by the spring.</p><p>“The moon illuminated his pre-dawn path, and strings of stars were still twinkling high above. After washing in the brook, he donned his shirt and quickly headed off to the sacred creation. The heavens were growing bright.</p><p>“And there he was, standing alone in that spot where a short time before the jubilant celebration of two settlements had taken place, the spot he had created by means of his dream.</p><p>“There can be such strength of feelings and sensations in a person in a moment such as this – someone who has never experienced something like this can’t possibly grasp it.</p><p>“You can say that Divine sensations and feelings arose in the person. And that they surged with the quivering anticipation of the dawn’s ray of light, in which… There she is! She, his most beautiful Lyubomila! Illuminated by the dawn’s ray of light, she was running to meet him, and to meet her co-creation.</p><p>“The vision incarnate rushed to Radomir. Of course there are no limits to perfection, but time suddenly stopped for the two of them. They entered went into their new house in a fog of feelings. There were victuals on the table, and the tantalizing scent of dried flowers coming from the embroidered coverlet on the bed:</p><p>“‘Of what are you thinking right now?’ she asked him in an ardent whisper.</p><p>“‘Of him. Of our future child.’ And Radomir started, glancing at Lyubomila. ‘Oh, how beautiful you are!’ And he, unable to hold back, touched her shoulder and cheeks with his hand, with great care.</p><p>“Lyubomila and Radomir weren’t simply happy inside: they were looking at each other in silent jubilation.</p><p>“‘My husband,’ Lyubomila whispered silently to herself. ‘My husband, thank you to the heavens and the entire Universe. What a blessing – good God, You give to people a life in love.’</p><p>“‘My wife,’ thought Radomir, gazing at Lyubomila. He partly closed his eyes and then opened them once more, so as to see her as if all of a sudden. As if she were the best vision in the world. As if the most vital goddess had appeared before him. But it wasn’t ‘as if’ Radomir was seeing the goddess Lyubomila before him. Radomir really did see a goddess.</p><p>“The blazing breath of Love enveloped the two of them and carried them off to unknown heights.</p><p>“No one in a million years could describe the details of what happens with him and with her when people put their</p><p> own likeness and God’s to use in a united burst of love, flowing together for co-creation.</p><p>“But the people-gods of Vedic Russian culture knew for sure, that when an inexplicable miracle occurs, uniting the two, then each of them will afterwards remain himself or herself. And at the same time, in an inexplicable instant, the Universe will shudder, as it beholds a vision: the Soul of a babe is rushing barefoot amongst the stars toward the Earth, working his little legs, embodying in his own self the two and a third in one united whole.</p><p>“The dawn was turning into a happy day. And the sun was rising above the earth. With a thin ray it shone more brightly on that spot where the gods were standing on earth. And the energy of Love – God’s gift to earthly gods – greater than the light of the sun, illuminated them with an invisible and blessed radiance. And the energy of Love exulted! Is it intelligent? Yes, it’s intelligent! While all feelings are tiny parts of intelligence, God thought of Love as the most important out of all of them. When God was creating the great creation of Earth, He said to Love:</p><p>“‘Hasten, My Love, hasten without stopping to think. Hasten with every last little spark you possess. Envelop them – all My future sons and daughters – with the great energy of grace.’</p><p>“Now, when Lyubomila and Radomir conceived a child in love, Love beseeched God:</p><p>“‘You, o Great Creator, are invisible. But Your children are visible. I, too, used to be invisible. Now I can see my reflection on the faces of Your children. They are Yours and as if mine, too. I want to look after their children, and I want to understand how You, o Great Creator, could foresee, when You gave all of me away, entirely, from You – how You could foresee the earthly grace? Appear before Your children in all Your beauty and greatness.’</p><p>“God answered Love in the whisper of a just barely noticeable breeze:</p><p>“‘I dare not distract My children from their great and inspired co-creation by my presence. And you, My Love, do not burn the young hearts as your exultation bursts forth. I recall the way you burned Me with the grace of your energy. I feel it – you are now burning our children with your exultation in the very same way.’</p><p>“‘My God, I am not burning them, but rather warming. You said, ‘our children’ and I shuddered just a bit, and for an instant there was more energy within me. But I swaddled them. I didn’t burn them. You said, ‘our children.’ That means they’re a tiny bit mine, too.’</p><p>“‘Those who are born in love will understand who their mother is, and their father.’”</p><p>“‘Vladimir, perhaps it isn’t easy to comprehend, but try to understand. For the Vedic Russians it wasn’t by any means the intimate connection that was most important in conceiving children. What people now do in bed, the act they call making love, only offends Love and debases God. They’ll satisfy their lust for but a moment, and I think that satisfaction is not comparable to even to one hundredth of that ordained for man by God.</p><p>“The Vedic Russians saw each other not as objects of carnal pleasure, but as something different.</p><p>“When the desire to co-create a child arose in Lyubomila and Radomir, they did not see him as separate from themselves. The culture of feelings in those times was different. The loving husband and wife saw the child in each other. And because of that, their caresses were entirely different. It wasn’t the urge to copulate that drew them to each other. What drew them was a great aspiration to co-create.</p><p>“And Radomir embraced Lyubomila as if he were embracing his child. He stroked her hair tenderly with his hand, touched her firm breast, stroked her shoulders and kissed her palms. She touched his face with her hands, and his shoulders. Tenderly grasping his neck, she pressed him to her breast the way she would a child…</p><p>“There’s no shortage of treatises in the world that try to teach people how to copulate. But there never has been – nor will there ever be – a treatise capable of presenting the Vedic Russian process of conception.</p><p>“It was not the bodies of the beloveds that played the main role. The bodies simply carried out the will and desires of the people. The people at that time were abiding in a different dimension. When the great deed was accomplished, they would return to Earth. The satisfaction they had received was not fleeting. It remained with them for all eternity, as if raising man one step closer to the highest perfection.</p><p>“It was accomplished, and Radomir, as though in a swoon, as though he had not returned from the previously unknown dimension, kissed Lyubomila as though kissing a newborn child, and then fell into a blessed sleep. Men can’t not fall asleep, perhaps because they wish to return to that place once more.</p><p>“But Lyubomila did not sleep. It was as though she felt an unusual little particle within her. She rose from the bed and went over to the window. The sun was shining into the window, dividing the windowsill into a light part and a shady part.</p><p>“Lyubomila ran her finger along the line where light and shadow met, removed the flaxen string from her wrist and lay it on the line where light and shadow met. The Vedic Russians would always mark the day and instant of conception.</p><p>“Then, they would plant a tree in the spot where the marriage had taken place, a tree whose trunk would be straight. Across from it, at the moment when the boundary between light and shadow upon the windowsill met the flaxen string, they would plant a second tree. They would plant the second tree in the shade of the first trunk. This act made it possible for them to always remember the moment when the child was conceived. And the horoscope will always be more accurate if it’s calculated based on that moment. Although the Vedic Russians knew about the arrangement of the planets and about their effect on the body, they wielded great energy and could accomplish the auspicious deeds in defiance of the planets.</p><p>“Afterwards, they would pour spring water between the trees and place the placenta on the ground. And then the person got a bit older, he would go to sleep on that spot on his conception day. The arrangement of the planets would shift slightly from year to year, and the person could sense all the information coming from the Cosmos in a night of sleeping this way. Not with his intellect, but rather with his subconscious, by feeling it. All the way back to God’s creation of everything on earth. And if some ailment or sadness were present, sleeping in that spot would drive it off. But only rarely were ailments able to strike the Vedic Russian body.</p><p>“The conception spot served for them as a place for sleeping, and for comprehending the universe in all its essence.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.213>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>13. Telegony can be Overcome</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“Anastasia, I’ve heard that the sages knew how to overcome the phenomenon of telegony, i.e., the repercussions of pre-marital relations. If a woman has pre-marital relations, then, as we now know, the first man will necessarily affect the appearance and temperament of a child conceived by a different man, by, let’s say, this woman’s husband.</p><p>“If they perform the rite of marriage you were talking about before they conceive a baby, will that eliminate the after effects of the woman’s pre-marital relations once and for all?”</p><p>“Vladimir, a child won’t always necessarily resemble the first man. It sometimes happens that the intensity of new experiences and of emotional perceptions erase data about previous unfortunate relations. But all the same, the Vedic Russians do have a rite that can help erase the old, the unwanted. It purifies the man and the woman, and three thoughts must participate in it. And whose thoughts those are – try to guess that on your own.”</p><p>“It would be better for you to tell me yourself right away, Anastasia. My brain is already overloaded from all this information.”</p><p>“All right, then, I’ll tell you. But it’s very important for people to learn to draw conclusions – the ones they need – on their own.”</p><p>“They’ll learn to do that at some point, but now it would be better just to tell me, because this is a very important question.”</p><p>“Then pose the most far-ranging question possible about what interests you.”</p><p>“What do you mean, the most far-ranging?”</p><p>“Vladimir, certainly you are aware that this phenomenon affects not only women, but men, too, to an equal degree. A man’s pre-marital relations have exactly the same effect on a future child, too. And the most respectable, virginal girl can give birth to not her own child, if the man is not a virgin. Are you aware of that, Vladimir?”</p><p>“Yes, Anastasia, unfortunately, I am. I read about how one soldier, returning from serving in the army, got drunk at the train station and slept with an Asian prostitute. He got home to his village, married the girl who’d been waiting for him, and their child was born with swarthy skin and slanted eyes. Everyone began blaming the girl, but there wasn’t a single Asian in the region, or anywhere nearby. But I thought it wasn’t necessary to talk about the men.”</p><p>“It’s certainly necessary to talk about the men as well – they need to play the main part in the rite.</p><p>“Here’s what the rite consists of. The man must construct a bed on the spot where the married couple lives, out in nature, beneath the starry sky. And himself make the bed up for himself and his woman. They must fast for three days and sleep beneath the starry sky for three nights. And before each night’s sleep, the man must bathe the woman with spring water, and bathe himself, too. The man must dry the woman with a linen cloth, but not dry himself off – he must only remove the water droplets from himself with his hands. The man must lie down in the bed with the woman wet. During these three days,</p><p>
 there must be no intimacy between them.</p><p>“As they fall asleep beneath the starry sky, on the first night each of them is to forgive the other for the past, and right away, from the first night on, they are to imagine their future child.</p><p>“The man must have in his mind that the child must resemble his woman, and the woman must imagine him resembling the man.</p><p>“When these three days have passed, they may engage in physical intimacy, and the planets will erase any information within them about the past and about unconceived children.</p><p>“But before engaging in physical intimacy, the man must also crown the woman. In the Vedic Russian rite, it’s the girl who does this: she lays a crown upon the head of her chosen one, but in this rite, the man must crown the woman.</p><p>“Not all couples who have sought a place for their future homestead, found it and begun living on it need necessarily perform this rite.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“The search itself and the day’s first three preparations will purify them if they dream of their future child for three days without conceiving him…”</p><p>“But, Anastasia, where’s the third thought? You said that there must be three thoughts at the same time.”</p><p>“Yes, I did say that, and in the given case there were the three thoughts. On the third night, when the man and the woman were sleeping beneath the skies, the future child was helping them with his thought.”</p><p>“But where was he?”</p><p>“In the place where all children wait before their earthly embodiment is conceived.</p><p>“And that is the entirety of the rite that a great sage worked out and presented to the people, and he himself rejoiced at how effective was his rite. Once it came into being, there came to be more happy families.</p><p>“Vladimir, did you understand everything? Will you be able to tell people about this rite?”</p><p>“Of course, I understood, and I’ll tell them everything.”</p><p>“And you won’t add anything to my story?”</p><p>“No, I won’t.”</p><p>“In that case, the rite won’t be effective.”</p><p>“What? Why not?”</p><p>“The forbears’ thought won’t be taken in.”</p><p>“Yes, I recall Grandfather talking about how it’s essential for us to ask their forgiveness. I’ll remind the readers about that. Although I don’t totally get why our generation in particular needs to ask forgiveness. I mean, we weren’t the ones who concealed and destroyed their culture.”</p><p>“Certainly, you can think that way: ‘we weren’t the ones.’ But it would be better if a different thought were to come into your head.”</p><p>“What thought?”</p><p>“Our generation has been granted the great honor and blessing of bringing back our ancestors’ culture. Of connecting the link to them that has been broken. Only then will great discoveries begin to occur within people. Only then will their thoughts come to the aid of ours. Presently, their thoughts are bound to oppose us, due to our lack of understanding.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.214>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>14. The Psychology of how a person is Conceived and comes into the World</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>When you consider this question, you can see right away that, according to Anastasia’s information, the process by which a person is conceived and borne and comes into the world is not mainly physiological, but psychological. It is a man and woman’s highest joint creation. It is the result of the supreme effort of their thoughts, feelings and intellect.</p><p>Initially, this kind of assertion bewildered me, just as it would, I think, many readers, and so I’ll present a more detailed conversation on this topic.</p><p>“But, Anastasia, how can one say that it’s mainly psychological? After all, a real, material fetus develops in the mother’s uterus. The woman experiences real physiological sensations, sometimes painful ones. Many popular science books have been written on the subject of child bearing and how a child comes into the world. They sometimes go into very great detail, telling about what a pregnant woman should do and how she should do it, specifically in terms of physiology. So it turns out physiology really is first and foremost after all.”</p><p>“Yes, that opinion really has taken firm root in human society, and that is a very sad fact: it indicates that the main component of the human ‘I’ is being shifted to a secondary position or pushed away entirely. This is precisely why people are coming into the world who are, in their nature, distant from God’s likeness.</p><p>“You can see for yourself, Vladimir: a fetus in a mother’s womb lives and develops not because someone wrote some treatise or other on this subject, but because that’s the way the Creator and nature designed it. To interfere in this supremely perfect process is to replace the natural and the perfect with the artificial and the less perfect.</p><p>“The physiology of the formation of the human body was programmed by the Creator and is capable of following its course all on its own, without the mother and father having to bother about directing the given process.</p><p>“The psychology and philosophy of birth – an immeasurably more advanced process – are entirely under the control of the mother and father. This is a joint creation by man and God.</p><p>“The pain that arises at the moment an infant is born is evidence of the parents’ incorrect psychological approach to the birth process.</p><p>“A great many animals bear their offspring out in nature, and none of them perishes or experiences suffering. And God did not envision pain for his beloved creation, man, either. Just as loving parents don’t envision pain for their children.</p><p>“When a woman fulfilled her highest life’s purpose – that of creating a Divine person – the Creator revealed a reward to this woman who was carrying within her the Divine fetus. This reward was a feeling of bliss during labor, a succession of joyful raptures, not pain. On the contrary, the process of birthing a person should be joyful and pleasant.</p><p>“Through his unjust interference, man himself – deceived by the occult sciences and indoctrinated by the dark side – has made the infant’s birth painful for his mother and a deadly shock for the infant.”</p><p>“How does shock have anything to do with it, especially a shock that’s deadly for the infant? I mean, he’s simply being born.”</p><p>“Yes, he’s being born, but he doesn’t understand why, while this is going on, something is roughly pushing him out of this pleasant and perfect place, and why his mother is suffering and feeling pain. The mother’s pain causes the infant great suffering.”</p><p>“What, are you saying one can give birth without any pain at all?”</p><p>“Not simply without any pain, but with the greatest, most pleasurable delight and joy.”</p><p>“Well, contemporary medicine can do just that – provide a nearly pain-free labor – using anesthesia.”</p><p>“Anesthesia will reduce the mother’s pain, but it will increase the infant’s emotional pain – after all, when he’s anesthetized, he loses contact with his mother. This state will sow fear in him, and a lack of self-confidence, and they will remain within him even when he’s grown, even when he’s extremely aged. They will prevent him from being reborn.”</p><p>“But why does that kind of thing happen?”</p><p>“When a person is living in his mother’s womb, he’s cozy within it, he’s comfortable and serene and calm. Physically, he is receiving everything he needs. The problems a person commonly experiences in everyday life are absent, and this enables him to sense the entire universe.</p><p>“Over the course of nine months, all information since the creation of the world, regarding the beautiful universe, regarding people’s life purpose, is communicated to him.</p><p>“His world within his mother’s womb is beautiful, and vast.</p><p>“And suddenly, something is roughly striving to push him out of the great serenity. All women know that these are contractions that have begun. It is as if they are unavoidable, and for this reason people don’t think about what sensations the infant might be experiencing as a result of them. And too few women in today’s world know that they don’t need to frighten their child during the contractions, that on the contrary, they can caress him, talk to him, engage with him and invite him to be born into the world. And not experience any pain themselves as they do this.</p><p>“He will hear his mother’s call and his father’s, and he’ll interpret the squeezing as a caress and a summons. He’ll want to find out about this unusual thing, want to be born into the world of his own desire.</p><p>“When a woman is frightened by the contractions, the person in her womb experiences fear.</p><p>“When a woman has pain from the contractions and her thoughts are only of herself, it’s doubly painful to the person in the womb: he feels abandoned, but the main thing is, he feels helpless and defenseless. Feelings like these are harmful and lingering. They wipe away the information previously received about the universe. They wipe it away because they contradict it. In this kind of labor, for the first time in his life, a person feels he is not a master of the universe, but a nothing, subject to certain other forces.</p><p>“The person’s body will be born, but the spirit of a master and kind creator will not be born within him. A person like this will not become a Divine Likeness. He will be but the slave of a different entity, and in vain will he for his whole life attempt to free himself from slavery.</p><p>“After all, the earth’s tsars and presidents, just like their guards and staff, too, are slaves of circumstance. They seem to be making some kind of important decisions and striving to build a happy life for themselves, but their life grows ever more unhappy and hopeless, and the air and water fade into darkness.</p><p>“The thought of hopelessness during delivery, instilled by pain, prevents human society from making fitting decisions.”</p><p>“Yes, it’s a terrifying scene, that kind of birth. Maybe it’s a good thing that some women do Cesarean sections now? What do you think, maybe this kind</p><p> of thing doesn’t happen with a C-section?”</p><p>“No, it does happen. You’d be hard pressed to call that procedure the birth of a person. It’s much more like an ordinary operation. And during that operation, who brings the person into the world: the mother who has not given birth to the child, or the surgeon who cuts the fetus out of the mother’s body?</p><p>“The infant who is yet to make his appearance in the world suddenly loses contact with his mother, and thus, with the entire universe. Then they extract him from the womb by force. Why? And where are they taking him? And why are they so rough? And why doesn’t anything depend on him? The entire world collapses around him!</p><p>“People think a child is born into the world, but at the moment he’s born, he feels he’s perishing. And it would seem the infant person is alive, but in actual fact, only his body has remained alive. His whole life, he will try to seek out his Divine ‘I’ using the feeble remains of his spiritual essence. Only his father and mother are to blame here.”</p><p>“Anastasia, if I understand you correctly, the future of women’s offspring and the future of the entire human civilization depend on women and the way they go through pregnancy and give birth. Is that right?”</p><p>“Yes, Vladimir, that’s right. But a person’s birth depends no less, but rather, equally, on the father, the man.”</p><p>************************ When a Man Brings a Baby into the World ************************</p><p>“Hold on, Anastasia, hold on. Explain to me what you mean by the words ‘when a man brings…’ I mean, a man can’t give birth. He’s physiologically incapable of giving birth.”</p><p>“And that is exactly where the deception lies. When they convinced the majority of people that what’s most important in childbirth is the physiological process, then they excluded the great spirit of Our Father the Creator from the birthing process. More precisely, they excluded God Our Father from childbirth. His absence manifested in women as labor pains and, subsequently, as human suffering.”</p><p>“Can you explain in more detail what role a man plays in childbirth? And why excluding him is the same as excluding God? Should the father, the man, deliver his wife’s baby?”</p><p>“It’s not at all necessary for the man to deliver the baby. It’s enough for him to be nearby. Delivering the baby is not the father’s main mission.”</p><p>“But then what is his main mission?”</p><p>“To understand this you need to realize that the mother’s womb nourishes the body of the fetus conceived within it by the beloved man. The womb nourishes the body, and it is important, but it really is not the most important thing.</p><p>“The fetus responds to the mother’s state and feelings and to the father’s feelings in equal measure, too.</p><p>“When the husband talks to his pregnant wife, the fetus can’t make out his parents’ words and doesn’t fully understand the meaning of the spoken words, but he senses his parents’ feelings quite keenly.</p><p>“Sometimes, overcome by tenderness, men will stroke their pregnant wife’s belly and, pressing their ear to it, hear the child stir. This kind of touch is pleasant for the woman, and while it might seem that the fetus inside her couldn’t physically feel it, he does feel it on an immensely greater level.</p><p>“The streams of feelings from his mother and father flow to him, and he receives them with great joy, with bliss.</p><p>“The fetus perceives things on the level of feelings and thought. When his parents await a child in love and harmony and think of him, then although he’s only just been conceived, he is constantly within his mother and father’s energy field, and he enjoys it.</p><p>“Through his mother and father’s sensations, the child senses the surrounding space beyond bounds of the maternal womb.</p><p>“If the father, when he’s alongside his pregnant wife, hears a nightingale’s singing and rejoices at it, then the fetus in the mother’s womb will sense both the nightingale’s singing and his father’s joy. Once he’s born and grows up a bit, then he will rejoice at a nightingale’s singing just the way he did in the womb.</p><p>“If the father or mother suddenly gets frightened from seeing a snake, the little one, once he’s born, will also grow frightened upon seeing snakes. Of course he couldn’t see the snake himself when he was in the womb, but through what his parents saw, information about it will be stored in his subconscious for his whole life.</p><p>“When a father artfully sings a song to his pregnant wife, their baby, once he’s grown, will be able to sing just as well as his father. If the father begins contemplating the stars, the child who is born will evince an interest in the stars.”</p><p>“I also heard about how one composer would often play the piano for his pregnant wife, and when he did, he’d always repeat a tune he’d composed that had caught his wife’s fancy. But then the composer and his wife split up before their son was born. When the son got a bit older, the woman sent him to music school. And one day the woman heard the boy playing the father’s tune on the piano. Astonished, the woman figured the son must have run across the old sheet music somewhere – after all, this tune had never been played at a single concert, and the sheet music hadn’t been published anywhere. When she walked into the room, she saw that her son was playing without any sheet music at all. The woman asked her son:</p><p>“‘Son, who taught you to play that tune?’</p><p>“‘No one,’ the boy answered. ‘I just heard it somewhere, but I don’t recall where. I like it. And what about you, Mama?’</p><p>“‘I like it very much, too,’ the woman replied, and she asked her son, ‘But how were you able to memorize it? I mean, at school you don’t start playing new pieces right away, not even when you’re using sheet music.’</p><p>“‘True, I don’t play them right away, but for some reason it was easy to memorize this one. It was like it was inside me. I want to expand on it, follow up on the tune and add to it.’</p><p>“The boy expanded on his father’s tune, which he’d heard in his mother’s womb. He became a composer, just like his father.”</p><p>“You’ve cited a good example, Vladimir, and it’s not an isolated one. Many examples show that, in effect, a child’s education begins with the mother’s womb. And even a bit earlier, before conception occurs.”</p><p>“What do you mean, earlier? I mean, before conception, no one exists yet.”</p><p>“Now, you were telling me about telegony, Vladimir, about how a woman’s child can sometimes be born resembling her first man and not the one with whom the physical conception took place. And this very phenomenon shows that a person who has not even been conceived yet, who is only waiting in line to be conceived, makes sense of his father’s information.”</p><p>“Does such a line really exist?”</p><p>“Yes. As soon as intimacy occurs between a man and woman, a spirit is born in that space, ready to incarnate.”</p><p>“And even if the intimacy occurred just for the heck of it, not to produce children?”</p><p>“The spirit appears when the man experiences satisfaction.”</p><p>“Are you talking about orgasm?”</p><p>“I don’t like that word, Vladimir – the associations we have with it don’t correctly express the heart of the matter.”</p><p>“Fine, then let’s say satisfaction. But can you at least prove somehow that this spirit does appear?”</p><p>“You yourself will find the proof, Vladimir, should you wish to do so. After all, one person will grasp the essence of this phenomenon from hearing but a few words, but with another, you’ll have to devote years and present a great number of examples, but even then he may not wish to understand.”</p><p>“But can contemporary science offer at least some circumstantial evidence of what you’re talking about?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Which science? Biology? Genetics? I need to know that, so it will be easier for me to search for the proof.”</p><p>“You’ll easily be able to find the proof in physics, Vladimir.”</p><p>“In physics? What’s physics got to do with it? I mean, you’re talking about the spiritual. This here is esoterics. We don’t need physics.”</p><p>“In physics there’s the law of conservation of energy.”</p><p>“But what’s this law got to do with it?”</p><p>“During intimacy with a woman, an unusually powerful energy builds up in a man, and at a certain moment, it is released. According to this law of conservation of energy, it can’t simply disappear without a trace, but it can change from one state into another. In the given case, the man’s colossal energy and its lightning quick release actually form the spirit.”</p><p>“Yes, that’s convincing. But sad at the same time. How many of those spirits are there that men have formed, that haven’t attained their physical incarnation? The number of them is probably many times larger than the number of people living on Earth.”</p><p>“Yes, many times larger.”</p><p>“Do they suffer, or do they remain as an energy that doesn’t comprehend anything?”</p><p>“They possess feelings. Their suffering is extraordinary.”</p><p>“But the ones who are conceived – do they begin feeling their parents right away?”</p><p>“Yes, immediately, and the father and mother in equal measure.</p><p>“In the space of the nine months the infant spends living in his mother’s womb, the parents can teach him a great deal. There’s no need to give him any lesson more than once. He immediately – and for his whole life – commits to memory all the information that comes through his parents.</p><p>“When the father possesses valuable knowledge, it’s as if for all the nine months, he is bearing his child and forming his spiritual and intellectual ‘I’.</p><p>“It’s precisely the father who gives birth to the person’s spiritual component. Fathers must draw up a program for the whole nine months that will shape the future person’s spirit, character and intellect.”</p><p>“You’re talking about a program, Anastasia, about the father possessing valuable knowledge about the process of educating the child inside his mother’s womb, his child…”</p><p>“I’m talking not about the father educating his child, but about the giving birth. The father isn’t educating a child, but actually giving</p><p> birth to his future son or daughter’s second, non-material ‘I’.”</p><p>“It seems to me we don’t understand things that way at all. It’s probably a bad thing that we don’t. People generally think that the father’s main role in giving birth to a child ends with conception. After that, in the best case scenario, the father helps his pregnant wife around the house and makes sure she has everything she needs.”</p><p>“And unfortunately, that is precisely what often happens.”</p><p>“But if it’s the case that the father doesn’t understand what his role is, then who shapes the person’s key spiritual component?”</p><p>“It is shaped either by happenstance or by someone who is aware of it and wants to do so and is pursuing his own aims at the same time.”</p><p>“And so what happens is that men who aren’t aware they can fully participate in shaping their future child – starting at the moment of conception – end up raising their children in a kind of incomplete way?”</p><p>“Unfortunately, that is what happens in more than a few cases.”</p><p>It seems I’d begun to grasp the significance of what Anastasia had said and – in light of that – the total idiocy our life. Perhaps all our social disasters occur precisely because even when we’re right alongside our children, in the vast majority of cases, we in fact aren’t connected enough to them. We leave them to their fate or hand them over to someone else. But at the moment when Anastasia and I were discussing this topic, it wasn’t social circumstances that caused me to feel sorrow – and maybe even hopeless sorrow that would last my whole life. I didn’t even feel like continuing our conversation.</p><p>“You’ve gone pale, Vladimir, and the life has gone out of your eyes. Why is that?” Anastasia said, seeing the state I was in.</p><p>“I don’t have the strength to talk about this any more, Anastasia.”</p><p>“I have a pretty good idea of what you experienced just now. But you’ll feel better if you’re able to articulate the reasons for your sadness.”</p><p>“What’s there to articulate? Everything’s already clear. When I grasped the whole importance of your information about the process of birthing children, then at the same time I also understood that I didn’t participate enough in birthing my daughter Polina. But at the same time, neither my wife nor I knew how you really need to approach the process of birthing children. But you knew about this information, you gave birth to a son and a daughter, and it turns out that I’m once again on the sidelines. You knew, but even so, you didn’t tell me in time what a father needs to do. And as if that wasn’t enough, I remember you saying that I shouldn’t see our son at all for some period of time, even after he came into the world. Why did you do that, Anastasia?”</p><p>“Yes, Vladimir, I did say that to you. But think about it, what exactly would you have taught our son if you’d been living alongside me for nine months in the taiga? Would you like me to answer that question for you?”</p><p>“Go ahead and answer it.”</p><p>“Now, at that time, you were asking me to leave my family glade in the taiga, my space of Love that my parents created way back when. You wanted me to give birth in the city, in a hospital. And then you said it was essential to send our son to kindergarten and to the best schools, that you’d make him a businessman and that he should carry on your business.”</p><p>“Well, I did say that. There was a lot I didn’t know back then. Then all the same I made my peace with the fact that you can’t live in the city, and don’t want to, but all the same, you didn’t suggest I stay in the taiga with you.”</p><p>“And if I had suggested it, would you have stayed?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but maybe I would have stayed.”</p><p>“And what exactly would you have done?”</p><p>“What everybody does – some kind of man’s work around the property.”</p><p>“But you know full well, Vladimir – I don’t need any kind of physical help. Everything here is prepared to serve me selflessly: the air and the water and the wild animals and the grass. When I was asking about what you’d do here, the main thing I was interested in finding out was what thoughts you would have had as you awaited your son. You’re silent. But you know, they’ve remained the same, just as your words have, the words of the you of that time.</p><p>“And you would have regretted that you were unable to convince me to live in the city. And you were also hatching a plan to take me to the hospital, by force, to give birth. Weren’t you? Come on, admit it.”</p><p>“Well, actually, I did have that thought for a little while.”</p><p>“Now, Vladimir, imagine what our son would have felt, with thoughts like those coming from his father. And thoughts that were hostile, too.”</p><p>“Yes, basically, I get it now. It would have been bad for him. Even so, I feel sad that now I… Well, it’s like it ends up that I’m lacking as a father. And it also ends up that you gave birth to a son and daughter who are somewhat lacking, too.”</p><p>“Believe me, Vladimir, and don’t worry, don’t be sad. You are in no way lacking as a father for your children. And our children have received everything in full measure. Our son is even a bit overloaded with information and sensitivity: my great-grandfather Moses went a bit overboard in that regard, he couldn’t control himself one day.”</p><p>“But how can that be? I wasn’t anywhere near you when you were pregnant, I didn’t draw up any kind of plan, I wasn’t present for the birth and didn’t encourage my children to be born, but all the same, I ended up being, as you put it, in no way lacking as a father. But before this you proved the exact opposite was the case.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.215>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>15. The Rite for a Woman who Gives Birth without a Husband</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“The Vedic Russian civilization had a great number of rites, Vladimir. ‘Rite’ isn’t quite the right word for those events – it’s just that I can’t find a different word. To keep things simple we’ll use it, but bear in mind that in today’s language, you can call a Vedic Russian rite a scientific and rational act by man, one based on knowledge of all the Universe’s energies and of how the human soul interacts with them. Generations of sages and great wise men would work out the rites – you know this – and synchronize them with the stars. Other generations would test them out and improve them year in and year out.</p><p>“Among others, there was a rite for women who had to go through pregnancy and give birth to a child far from their husband. Such situations did occur in Vedic Russian civilization, although very rarely. It might happen that a man had to head off on a long campaign. His wife, who remained at home, pregnant, would perform a rite which was outwardly simple, but long lasting in terms of time, and complex for the mind and will. If that woman had strong love for the child’s father, then the woman was able to achieve the goal of giving birth to a complete child on her own. Love – the great energy – helped her do this.”</p><p>“But what actions did this rite consist of? In our modern world there are also women who have to go through pregnancy and then give birth without a husband. The rite you’re talking about might be useful to them.”</p><p>“A woman who’s conceived a child and who is far from the father of her child needs to mentally interact with the child on the father’s behalf – for no less than three hours each day, over the course of nine months. And sometimes mentally converse with the father about the future child, and maybe argue, but under no circumstances should any hostility be allowed, even during an argument. The parents’ conversations with each other and the child should be only kindly.</p><p>“It’s preferable for the conversation to always take place at one and the same time. The woman’s interaction with the child on the father’s behalf can be divided into two parts – in the morning and in the evening. Roughly 15-19 minutes before she mentally converses with the child on the father’s behalf, it’s essential for the woman to consume a small quantity of quickly digestible food, or a drink that’s beneficial for her and the child.</p><p>“One and the same drink should be consumed before the mental conversation over the course of the whole nine months. She should not consume it under any other circumstances except before the mental conversation.</p><p>“I, for example, prepared a drink that consisted of roughly a hundred grams of cedar milk, three drops of cedar oil, and a pinch of flower pollen. I would take a bit of honey on a stick, mix it all up in a wooden mortar and drink it in very small sips.</p><p>“You can make a drink out of other products, only they must definitely be natural, ecologically pure, easily digested by the mother’s organism, and beneficial and pleasant to the child inside the mother’s womb. That is very important.</p><p>“If the drink the mother consumes is unwholesome and unpleasant for the child, then he will have unpleasant associations with conversing with his father, and in the future he will reject his father and resist interacting with him.</p><p>“After the child is born, the woman should consume this drink a short time before the feeding time when she’s intending to communicate on the father’s behalf.</p><p>“If, as he gets older, the child stops consuming his mother’s milk, but the father has not yet come on the scene, the woman should never give the child the drink she’s selected. She must offer it to him at the moment when he first has contact with his father.</p><p>“As well, the woman must choose a star in the starry heavens, one through which to communicate with the man she loves. And each time, before her mental conversation with the child, she should call it to mind.</p><p>“As she mentally converses with the child, the woman should picture his father as distinctly as possible: his personality, intonations and worldview, and she mustn’t hide the truth or paint the man in a better light. And if she doesn’t</p><p> agree with him about something, she should try to explain her understanding of it – not belligerently, but with love. She mustn’t lay the blame for the misunderstanding on the man, but rather, consider herself incapable of presenting her thought convincingly and comprehensibly. Or, perhaps, think more carefully about what the man had said.</p><p>“As well, the pregnant woman should stroke her belly during the conversation, and at the same time mentally picture the father.</p><p>“And it’s very important for her, when conversing with her man, to exclude all negative moments, if these have occurred previously. She must recall only the very best in her interactions with him.</p><p>“For the entire nine months, such a woman should strive to be in seclusion as much as possible. Then the child will feel her and his father. And even if the husband and father won’t be near him, it doesn’t matter – the child will nevertheless be in the father’s aura.</p><p>“If the woman performs the acts of the given rite, then the man will come to her, return to her and to his child. Even if his love was weak before, or didn’t exist at all, it doesn’t matter – love, summoning him to do good deeds, will burst into flame within him with extraordinary intensity.</p><p>“Many Vedic Russian women knew the acts of this rite, knew its power. Then the sages tried to erase it from women’s memory and would use it only when they were certain the woman had no tainted feelings.”</p><p>“What kind of tainted feelings, Anastasia?”</p><p>“If a woman in love was tainted, she could use the given rite to take possession of a man who didn’t love her. And even if he was living with a different wife. And even if she had never been intimate with him.”</p><p>“But what do you mean, if she hadn’t been intimate? A child can’t be conceived without intimacy, so if that’s the case, who would she be able to tell about the father?”</p><p>“A woman might conceive with any man at all – that’s unimportant – but then interact with the child she’s conceived on behalf of the one she loves. And in this way draw the man she loves to her. What’s more, in appearance, the child will also resemble the man she loves and not the one she was actually with. You should be aware of this from the phenomenon of telegony, Vladimir.”</p><p>“Yes, I am aware, but Anastasia, why are you giving out something the sages had hidden? Now certain women will begin using this rite to lead the men they like away from their families. We can’t make it public.”</p><p>“Go ahead and publish it without the slightest worry, Vladimir. I’ve removed one of the rite’s elements – now it won’t be able to destroy a happy family.”</p><p>“But if you were able to remove an element, then why didn’t the sages remove it?”</p><p>“The sages didn’t know what one should replace it with.”</p><p>“The sages didn’t know, but you were able to find out? And besides that, Anastasia, you said the sages always tested their rites’ efficacy. But you weren’t able to test it.”</p><p>“Yes I was.”</p><p>“When? On whom???”</p><p>Oh, my God! I recalled the words Anastasia had uttered many years before. I didn’t attach any significance to them back then, but now… Here are the words: “Vladimir, I will return to you your daughter’s respect and your wife’s love.” It’s unbelievable, but she did that! But then why isn’t my wife jealous of Anastasia? And why does my daughter treat her with respect? This year I spent time with my family. Anastasia was able to achieve something unbelievable. I don’t understand how, or what powers she used, but she was able to do it.</p><p>All the institutes on earth, the ones that take such pride in their technological achievements, can’t solve the main problem on earth: how to bring love and respect back into families. But she can. Good God! What colossal, truly Divine knowledge is humanity losing? And why? Who will provide an answer?</p><p>And what strong love Anastasia herself is worthy of! Our descendants will probably value what she has done to a greater degree than do we, today’s people. I wanted to do something good for Anastasia. I walked up to her, went down on one knee, and kissed her hand. She also knelt down and hugged me around the neck. I heard the beating of her heart, sensed the unusual fragrance of her hair and her intoxicating breath, the scent of breast milk that was as if from my mother’s breast, and I whispered:</p><p>“Anastasia, what I can do to be worthy of you?”</p><p>But she didn’t reply. She just pressed my head to her breast a bit more strongly. My good fortune has most likely never known happier seconds, hours and days.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.216>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>16. And where the Heck are we supposed to Give Birth to our Children?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>How hard it is to write in a dry style, but all the same I really do have to calmly figure out, without getting all worked up, where the heck is the best and most comfortable place for the parents and the infant to go through labor and delivery. In a hospital operating room or at home?</p><p>As far as I know, the first maternity hospitals appeared in Ancient Egypt and Rome, when the slave-owning system was in place. They were set up for pregnant slaves.</p><p>When a slave gave birth to a child, she spent from 5 to 9 days with the infant, then began working again and would visit the child to nurse him and to spend the night.</p><p>That went on for 6 to 12 months. It was different in different places, depending on how the slave owners treated their slaves. Once the mother was separated from her child, he was cared for first by specially trained slave nannies, and later on, when the child was a bit older, he went to other slaves to be educated, depending on what duty the master had specified for him.</p><p>For example, they’d give boys to specialists who’d make warriors of them. These warriors, who didn’t know their parents and would go through special physical training and psychological preparation, were the most loyal to their slave owner. From the time they were children, it was drilled into them that he was a mother and a father to them and, basically, God. There was even a religion that was developed specifically for this kind of indoctrination.</p><p>And how similar that ancient situation would seem to be to today’s reality. Maternity hospital – day care – kindergarten – school – college – and the slave is ready. And since the master is invisible, the slave considers himself a free man and, consequently, he won’t put up a fight.</p><p>Even in their worst nightmares, the nobles of Ancient Rome and Egypt – and the middle class, too – couldn’t have imagined giving birth to their child outside the home.</p><p>At first they would invite doulas – and then, later, doctors and diviners – into their homes.</p><p>In Russia, the first huts for laboring mothers were intended for loose women, for prostitutes. Sometimes women in this category would go to a gypsy camp to give birth and would leave their unwanted children there to be raised. The gypsies would accept them.</p><p>Basically, a maternity hospital is a piece of nonsense. It is a glaring illustration of the fact that women have lost the birthing instinct and that modern man has lost not only the wellspring people’s knowledge, but the basic culture of feelings, as well. They’ve lost the feeling of sincere love for the woman and one’s own child as a part of oneself and of one’s continuation.</p><p>A child born in a maternity hospital cannot be only yours. He’s someone else’s, too. The birthing process includes conception, pregnancy, and the infant coming in the world. And the last part is no less significant than all the others. If you deliver him into someone else’s hands, the hands of someone who is by and large indifferent to you and your child, then your connection to your child’s birth will be incomplete. As a result, you won’t fully experience fatherly feelings toward him, and he’ll sense this. And later on, he’ll pay you back with a lack of strong filial feelings.</p><p>And the love won’t be complete, either. These children will be unable to love not just their parents, but life, too – it failed to seem appealing to them, right from the first moment they came into the world.</p><p>Of course we can compensate for this deficiency by taking certain actions in relation to the newborn, but it’s not a simple thing.</p><p>As we go back further in history, we can see the way children come into the world in various world cultures as more perfect – and the way this happens in our time as absurdly primitive.</p><p>In today’s modern world it’s similar to taking an appendix out of a sick person’s body.</p><p>That’s why I wanted to talk about something more joyful. All the same, mankind is starting to give some thought to the crux of what’s going on.</p><p>“Spiritual midwifery schools” are starting to crop up in Russia, the USA and France. The “Prenatal Education Association” is already active in a number of countries.</p><p>Courses on home birth are being given in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. People are trying to bring back the lost knowledge and traditions. To bring back lost love.</p><p>Let’s take a look at how labor and delivery proceeded in the Vedic Russian family. The way Anastasia tells it, here’s what would happen.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.217>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>17. Vedic Russian Labor and Delivery</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>The expectant woman’s mother and grandmother would tell her what kind of symptoms and sensations she could expect on the day before labor would begin. And so Lyubomila’s grandmother told her in detail how she’d given birth to her own children.</p><p>As a rule, a Vedic Russian woman would give birth in her own home, in a wooden trough not unlike our bathtubs, only shorter in length, and shallower. This was a special basin intended for use during delivery, and afterwards it was also used as a cradle for the infant.</p><p>Into it they would pour pure spring</p><p> water that had been warmed to body temperature. On the outside of the tub, along the sides, there were ledges where the woman would place the soles of her feet.</p><p>The tub’s edges were curved in such a way that made it comfortable to hold on to them with your hands. Back then, they didn’t use a thermometer to determine the air temperature in the lodgings: they said it should be such that an exposed human body would feel neither hot nor cold when in a resting state.</p><p>They would place the tub for the expectant woman on the floor and position it so the woman sitting in it could watch the sunrise.</p><p>Next to the tub they would put another vessel, one a bit smaller, with water in it.</p><p>They would lay four linen towels without embroidery or designs on a bench that they’d put next to the tub. The fabric would need to be smooth.</p><p>During Vedic Russian labor and delivery, only the laboring mother’s husband was in the room with her.</p><p>Neither experienced doulas, nor the parents, nor close relatives were in the room.</p><p>Before the contractions began, the father would light a previously laid bonfire by the entrance to the lodging, and it would give off a white, aromatic smoke. And as a rule, the close relatives would gather around this bonfire, and an experienced doula would come by, and often a sage.</p><p>The laboring woman’s parents and her husband’s would bring food and drinks along with them in little bundles and baskets, and they’d take a seat on benches under a canopy that the laboring woman’s husband had built alongside the bonfire.</p><p>According to Vedic Russian rules, no one from among them had the right to cross the lodging’s threshold. And the laboring woman’s husband also didn’t have the right to approach them or even to converse with them from a distance.</p><p>Such rules were not born of some kind of superstition. They were an extremely exact and psychologically precise procedure. No one and nothing was to distract the father’s thought – and even more so the laboring woman’s – from welcoming their child.</p><p>However, the presence of the parents and an experienced doula at the entrance to the homestead had a calming effect on the young future parents. They could always come to their aid in the case of an unusual and dangerous situation. Such a need arose extremely rarely.</p><p>During the contractions the mother would constantly converse with the child who was being born, encouraging him, helping him enter into this world that was new to him without any fear. The Vedic Russians were well aware of how important it is to interact with the person being born – both in one’s thoughts and aloud – and so the mother, the child and the father take part in the process.</p><p>It is also very important for the mother’s first glance at the newborn to be free of any dismay at his appearance (his temporarily flattened nose, his skin’s birth color, etc.), for it to be tender and ecstatic.</p><p>Once the child was born, the father would take him from the water and, using his mouth, immediately suck the mucus from the child’s little mouth and nose and lay him on the mother’s belly. She would then give the child her breast. This promoted expulsion of the placenta, which the husband would place in the previously prepared vessel. Then he would cut the umbilical cord with a sterilized knife and tie it.</p><p>Then the father would take the child out onto a towel, wash him, wrap him in a second towel, place him on the bed, wash his wife with water from the vessel next to the tub, dry her off with a clean towel and accompany her to the bed where the child lay.</p><p>Next the father, using his mouth or his hands, would draw milk from his wife’s breast and sprinkle it onto a linen sheet with which he would cover his wife who had just given birth and the baby lying on her belly or chest.</p><p>Then the father would sit down and silently regard his wife, and if she wanted to do so, she’d talk with him. If she were to fall asleep, he would not leave the room.</p><p>Then, after about fifteen minutes, he would light the firewood he’d previously laid out on the hearth.</p><p>In between the two trees they’d planted soon after the conception, he would pour out the water in which the baby had been delivered and the water he’d used to wash the new mother. He would dig the placenta into the soil in that same spot.</p><p>Those relatives who had gathered at the entrance to the homestead would see the smoke coming from the chimney and understand the father’s act: the delivery had been successful. And right at that moment, they would begin congratulating each other and offering the food and drinks they’d brought with them. After that they would go off to their own houses.</p><p>Vedic Russians understood that the baby can sense his parents’ thoughts and feelings when he’s still in his mother’s womb. When he comes into the world, he remains within his parents’ aura. If some strangers were to be in the dwelling, even relatives who were thinking kindly of the baby, their feelings would all the same be unfamiliar to the baby, even if they were kindly, and would cause him to be apprehensive.</p><p>As well, whether they intended to or not, the relatives would draw the parents’ thoughts away from the baby, and he was most comfortable in their psychological field.</p><p>You can do an experiment to prove this.</p><p>Many women know that when you’re nursing a child you mustn’t be distracted by conversations around you, or by thoughts, especially about something bad. The women concentrate on their child, on his nursing and mentally converse with him.</p><p>If you want proof of the fact that an infant really does sense his mother’s thoughts, go into a room where a mother is nursing a baby, and start talking to her. The child will immediately get upset and might even stop suckling and start crying. He’s grown uncomfortable – his mother’s thoughts of him have weakened or gone off somewhere, away from him.</p><p>But maybe it was the sound of the voice of the person who came in, or a smell that disturbed the infant?</p><p>I called my daughter Polina. She picked up the phone and began talking with me. After thirty seconds I heard my granddaughter Mashenka’s cry.</p><p>“Why’s she crying?” I asked my daughter.</p><p>“I’m nursing her, Papa,” Polina answered, “and she doesn’t like it when I get distracted.”</p><p>I tried to end our conversation quickly. And that’s what I did every time I called at an inopportune time. My granddaughter would always start crying.</p><p>Many nursing mothers who are familiar with the cultural knowledge concerning nursing infants confirm this effect.</p><p>This kind of thing just doesn’t happen with infants whose mothers are unaware of how important it is to be psychologically connected to their nursing child, and who chat away with whoever they want while they’re nursing, or think about their own problems. Why is that? Well, because their child just doesn’t know what a psychological connection to his mother is. He has never had it, and as a result, he has nothing to compare it with.</p><p>There’s an ancient saying: “He took it in at his mother’s knee.” What are infants taking in at their mothers’ knee today?</p><p>Human society has learned to create all manner of satellites and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But it’s lost something more important – the cultural knowledge concerning giving birth to and raising a person. And as a result, people end up pointing ballistic missiles at each other.</p><p>Who can say what connection there is between a culture of prenatal education, nursing an infant and wars? There’s a direct connection!</p><p>Many people still recall the story of Chikatilo, the serial killer from Rostov. He would sadistically brutalize young women and then kill them. Maniacs like this have appeared in many other cities, too, striking terror into the hearts of the population.</p><p>Every time they do, a great number of police set out to capture them.</p><p>But here’s an interesting common thread. It’s been determined that, at least in the case of the three maniacs from Rostov, their mothers unsuccessfully attempted to kill the fetus while it was still in her womb. As a result, the fetus was born, grew up and began taking revenge on women.</p><p>And so, think about it and tell me what’s more important for a girl who graduates from high school: to have earned excellent grades in physics, chemistry and a foreign language, or to have excellent knowledge of the culture of conception, pregnancy and childrearing?</p><p>I think the latter is immeasurably more important. But you know, the subjects that present this knowledge don’t appear in the school curriculum. And so high school and secondary school graduates conceive by accident and give birth. And they often change their minds: does it really make sense to have the baby? Maybe an abortion would be better?</p><p>It sometimes happen that they do give birth, but to what kind of babies? It’s not just that you can’t teach these babies about the achievements of physicists and chemists – you even have to keep knives and sticks far away from them.</p><p>In the age of scientific and technical progress, it’s especially important to give birth to a highly spiritual person.</p><p>It’s bad that the maniac Chikatilo killed and tortured women. It’s good that a maniac like him doesn’t have his finger on a nuclear button.</p><p>Sure, it’s good, but I’d also like to add: he doesn’t have his finger on it yet. He will have his finger on it if society doesn’t change its approach to the conventions of giving birth to a person.</p><p>Since Radomir and Lyubomila knew these conventions, they were able to carry out their firstborn son’s transition from his mother’s womb into his new world fairly smoothly and painlessly. Perhaps even joyously, for both them and the infant.</p><p>Lyubomila gave birth easily and without fear. Even merrily. When the infant emerged, she gave a cry that was not a cry of pain, but a joyful, welcoming cry. She herself pulled him from the water and pressed him to her.</p><p>When Radomir was washing Lyubomila with the pure water and</p><p> then drying her off, he felt like kissing every square inch of her body. He also felt like kneeling before her. And he did kneel, when the smiling Lyubomila was lying with their infant son beneath the sheet. He knelt down and softly and soulfully said:</p><p>“Thank you, Lyubomila. You have created, you are a goddess. You are capable of manifesting dreams.”</p><p>“We have created, Radomir,” Lyubomila replied to him with a smile.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.218>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>18. Radomir's Battle - and not his Last</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>The years passed in a happy life. Their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren were already living on their own homesteads. But love had not abandoned Radomir and Lyubomila. Although they had gone gray, with each year they nonetheless seemed to grow happier.</p><p>Radomir, a gray-haired old man, stood alone at the path that led out of his homestead. He was gazing at the road that ran up to a hill and disappeared beyond the hill. Two days earlier, his sons and grandsons had left and set off along that very road to fight. Even his still underage granddaughters had left.</p><p>Before them was an uncommon enemy. The prince had brought in some people who wore some kind of long, black clothing, people from a different country – they called them monks, for some reason. And they announced to all the settlements, that before now, they had all been living the wrong way. That they had to set aside their old beliefs and rites and bend their knees to a different god.</p><p>And the prince and his escort and his retinue bent their knees. As soon as the prince accepted the different faith, the people in black declared his power to be God-given.</p><p>Along with the black people there came soldiers, too, dressed in the garb of the prince’s retinue.</p><p>They fell upon one settlement after another and demanded that everyone think about god in a new way. Whoever didn’t want to bow down to their god was cut down with swords, and their homes and gardens were burned.</p><p>The elders of the families held a council: What should they do? They summoned the monks to the council and the prince, too, but the monks and the prince told them about the highest good that the new god would bring for all, and led them astray with a teaching no one understood. The elders had come face to face with a circumstance they’d never before encountered. Whenever an obvious opponent would fall upon the settlement, the men of all the families would swiftly join together to form a militia and drive the enemy from their land, hand in hand.</p><p>But here the monks in black kept talking about love and obedience. They spoke about the good, about a marvelous heavenly life for all who submitted to the new faith.</p><p>The elders didn’t immediately understand that behind the pretty words – as if behind a shield – lay hidden an essential core that had not been sent to them from God at all.</p><p>The Vedic Russian god did not act by means of the sword. But hostile retinues stood behind these monks. Several settlements’ residents went off into the woods. Others entered into battle. Some among them were in deep reflection.</p><p>And at dawn Radomir saw his grandsons leaving the homestead and his sons leaving the neighboring homesteads. They came together at this early hour by Radomir’s homestead, as if they’d arranged it the night before.</p><p>“Of course they arranged it,” Radomir decided. After all, the night before, his eldest son, his and Lyubomila’s first born, had said:</p><p>“We’re leaving tomorrow for military exercises. We’re going to learn how to keep enemies off our lands.”</p><p>They left, and as the second day was nearing sunset, they were not back. And gray-haired Radomir kept watching the road.</p><p>All of a sudden, a rider appeared on the hill. He was galloping along the road at top speed toward Radomir’s homestead. An elder, gray-haired like Radomir, sat skillfully atop a gallant quarter horse. Squinting, Radomir recognized in him his childhood friend Arga.</p><p>The gray-haired rider climbed from the horse, groaning, and began speaking to Radomir quickly:</p><p>“Who’s still here on your homestead? Just tell me quickly.”</p><p>“Lyubomila’s here, bustling around doing her evening chores, and our youngest great-grandson keeps pestering her with questions,” Radomir replied calmly, and he added: “That was a bit strange, the way you started off your conversation with me, Arga, asking me a question right off. You didn’t even greet me.”</p><p>“There’s no time. I’m in a hurry. Come on, take two horses and provisions for three days. Take Lyubomila and your great-grandson along with you and ride off with me right away.”</p><p>“Where to?”</p><p>“Into the forest, to the Drevlyans (forest dwellers). There’s one family there I know well, they’ll take us in. The enemies won’t be able to find us in the middle of the forest. Years will go by, and perhaps the people will come to their senses. You’ll manage to save your great-grandson, Radomir. That means you’ll save the family line.”</p><p>“And I thought you’d come riding over here to help me, Arga. There are two Vedic Russian swords there, strapped to your saddle. What do you need them for, if you’re planning to hide from the enemies out in the woods?”</p><p>“The swords – they’re just there. I’m not intending to fight anyone. They are great in number. They’ll conquer us. What point is there in senseless dying?”</p><p>“Yes, Arga, I know, you’ve never fought with anyone. You didn’t even join in the men’s games during Butter Week.”</p><p>“That’s not what I’m talking about now. You know as well as I do, Radomir: a person’s life can be eternal, and his soul can incarnate anew in an earthly body. But in order for that to happen, a person must not think of death before he dies. He must send a beautiful thought into the future. Wherever the thought ends up, that’s where the person will be born anew.”</p><p>“I know all of that, Arga. You and I studied with the sages alongside each other.”</p><p>“Then you must recall, Radomir: in battle you might be mortally wounded and not have time to think of your new incarnation.”</p><p>“I do recall, but I cannot leave my family homestead, Arga. It’s alive, and it won’t understand why its master and friend is suddenly betraying the love the space has given him. Why he’s leaving it to be torn apart by enemies.”</p><p>“It’s alive? It won’t understand? You’ve always been sentimental, Radomir, and you still are. Well then, go ahead and stay. Stay put.”</p><p>Arga paced quickly back and forth, patted his horse on its withers, and then went up to Radomir once more. The two gray-haired elders stood opposite each other, silent. No one can say now, what was beating in their hearts. Perhaps the two gray-haired friends were thinking of different things. And Arga was the first to speak again, with agitation:</p><p>“If that’s what you’ve decided, Radomir, go ahead and stay. But… but… give me Lyubomila, your great-grandson, and a horse: let them at least be saved. You go ahead and stay, if you don’t want to take leave of your living space.”</p><p>Radomir cast a glance at his friend and replied:</p><p>“You can discuss it with Lyubomila yourself, Arga. I know you’ve loved her your whole life. That’s why you couldn’t marry any other girl and build your own family homestead.”</p><p>“Who, me? I loved her? What nonsense!” Arga suddenly began quickly pacing back and forth once more, as if trying to convince himself. “I’m an artist. All my life I wanted to paint pictures and carve figurines. What do I need a wife for? I’m your friend, and I decided to help you save your family line. And I’d totally forgotten about Lyubomila.”</p><p>“You’re a great artist, Arga. And the best carver. The statues you’ve made adorn the homes of many settlements. Only, people know that all the women in your paintings always resemble Lyubomila. And your figurines, too.”</p><p>“They resemble her? Well, and what about it? I’ve been working on perfecting one facial type in my paintings.”</p><p>“All your life you’ve been careful to hide your love, Arga. And you’re hiding it now. I was over by a pine tree, one that stands near the forest’s edge. I know you often liked to sit beneath it and carve your figurines out of wood. Not long ago I came upon your hiding place there and one of your works is hidden there, unfinished. It shows a beautiful maiden taming a high-mettled steed. Only Lyubomila could do that, and you and I both know it.”</p><p>“Whether I loved her or didn’t love her, or painted and did carving – please understand, that’s not what we’re talking about now.” After saying nothing for a bit, Arga exclaimed, nearly shouting:</p><p>“Radomir! Radomir! All your sons have fallen in battle, and all your grandsons have fallen.”</p><p>Radomir, calm on the outside, looked at Arga and said nothing.</p><p>“Save yourself,” Arga went on. “I saw them before the battle. I tried to talk them out of getting into an uneven fight. Your eldest son, your first born, he – just the same as you – he’s the spitting image of you…”</p><p>“You’re stalling, Arga. Tell me, how did my eldest son answer?” Radomir asked his childhood friend, as if not at all agitated.</p><p>“He replied, ‘We will take up battle. We’ll hold the black monks for at least an hour or two.’ And I asked your son, ‘Why should you die? Why do you need these two hours?’”</p><p>“‘That’s what the whole family decided at the council,’ your eldest son answered, Radomir. He said, ‘May the happy life of our parents Radomir and Lyubomila be extended, at least for two hours.’</p><p>“Along with the children from the settlements neighboring yours, they held back the black monks, the warriors who outnumbered them, for an entire day. Then the monks cut down all the children, returned to their hide-out, and in the early morn, they will head for your homestead.”</p><p>Radomir listened to his friend and said nothing. Arga kept going and going, agitated:</p><p>“I came galloping over to help you save your family line. I know it, and you know it: it’s possible to</p><p>
 be born anew on Earth. But there chances are better if you’re reborn into a body in your family line. Only your great-grandson is capable of continuing the family line for you. Give Lyubomila and your great-grandson to me, and I’ll…”</p><p>Arga suddenly seemed to trip over his words. He fell silent and began looking past Radomir. And Radomir turned in that direction, too. Behind him, leaning against a tree, stood Lyubomila. Tears were flowing from her eyes and her hand, pressed to her chest, was shaking.</p><p>“Did you hear what Arga was saying?” Radomir asked Lyubomila.</p><p>“Yes, I heard,” she replied, her voice shaking.</p><p>Radomir walked up to her and began stroking her hair and kissing her hand, and he asked her, “So why are you crying, Lyubomila? The children gave up their lives for the sake of our happy day. It’s not fitting for us to pass it in sorrow.”</p><p>Lyubomila smiled through her tears. “It’s not fitting.”</p><p>“You’re smart, my wife. You learned the sages’ wisdom better than all the rest. Think about how we should happily spend the remainder of the day, and the night and the morning.”</p><p>“I’ll think about it, and so we won’t upset our children, let’s go into our space of Love. Our little great-grandson is there, it’s time to feed him.”</p><p>And, joining hands, they set off for the entrance to their family homestead.</p><p>Arga climbed into his saddle and called out after them:</p><p>“You’re crazy. You’re both sentimental fools. You need to save yourselves. You can’t take up battle with anyone. When you’re wounded, you might not manage to send the thought of your incarnation to a space. I’m going to dash away now and save myself. And I suggest you save yourselves, too.”</p><p>Radomir turned at the entrance and answered his gray-haired friend:</p><p>“Go on and save yourself, Arga. Gallop off to the forest hideaway. Our path of salvation is different.”</p><p>Arga put the spurs to his horse, made it rear up, and then galloped off to the forest at top speed.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.219>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>19. They will Return Once More from the Stars to Earth</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br><img src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/arga-vk.com-kumar82.jpg></div></p><p> </p><p>As they approached the house where their great-grandson Nikodim awaited them, Lyubomila said:</p><p>“Radomir, I think we need to play a game of life now with our child.”</p><p>Radomir was surprised. “What game is that? I haven’t heard of it.”</p><p>“I’ve never played it, either. But when I was a child, I heard two old sages talking with each other about it. The point of the game was for one of them to play out the stages of one’s whole life with the child, while the second mentally recalled, as fast as he could, and in detail, all that he knew of life. And if the storyteller’s thought was vivid, then the child would remember the story subconsciously. And when he grew up, he’d be able to discover within himself a great many hints about how to live.”</p><p>“What do you think, Lyubomila, who should play with the child?”</p><p>“You, Radomir. I’ll perform the storytelling in my thoughts.”</p><p>“But how will you manage to narrate all the wisdom of life in an hour? After all, in an hour it will be time for us to put Nikodim to bed.”</p><p>“I’ll try to finish in time. You start the game – clap out the stages of life with your hands.”</p><p>Four year-old Nikodim was running toward him, his arms outstretched. Radomir caught him and tossed him up into the air, set him down on the ground once more and said:</p><p>“I heard about an interesting game not long ago. Do you want to play it?”</p><p>“I do,” Nikodim answered, “but how do you play it?”</p><p>“I’ll name something from life in words, and without using any words, you’ll depict it using acts or gestures. And Grandmother will watch your actions and gestures.”</p><p>Nikodim started hopping up and down from joy. “How interesting. Let’s start playing right now.”</p><p>Radomir clapped his hands. “Let’s,” he said, and continued: “Nikodim the boy was born into the world. He’s still tiny-tiny, no more than an infant.”</p><p>The tiny tot quickly lay down on the ground, stretched out his little hands and bent his little knees. “Waa, waa…” he said, portraying an infant.</p><p>Radomir clapped his hands and continued:</p><p>“The little tot began standing up on his little legs.”</p><p>And right away, Nikodim stood up on his little legs, took a step, as if for the first time, stumbled, lowered himself down onto all fours, crawled that way for a meter, stood up once again and took a walk, confidently now already.</p><p>Another clap. Radomir said:</p><p>“Everything in life interested the little tot: he studied the bugs, the grass and tried to understand how apples grow, why the sun comes up and why he felt so good amidst it all, both in the summer and when winter came.”</p><p>Little Nikodim bent down, studied the bugs in the grass, looked at the sky and jumped for joy, then suddenly ran up to his granddad, hugged the elder’s legs and raced over to his grandmother, who was sitting on the grass. He grabbed her around the neck, pressed his cheek to hers and kissed her.</p><p>Radomir clapped his hands and said:</p><p>“It just so happened that all the people left their homesteads. They didn’t go along the roads, and where they went – it wasn’t clear. Perhaps they flew off to the stars, as if they were birds. Enemies were heading for the homestead where the little tot alone remained. They were going to burn the houses and chop down the gardens.”</p><p>Little Nikodim listened to his granddad’s terrifying tale. He didn’t move, didn’t depict anything, and then he said:</p><p>“I don’t like to play that way. Things of that sort shouldn’t happen in life.”</p><p>“Yes, in life they shouldn’t. But after all, this is a game,” Radomir replied to his great-grandson.</p><p>His great-grandson stomped his foot and shouted: “Well, I’m not going to play it. I won’t!”</p><p>“I’ll play,” Lyubomila announced, having gotten up off the grass. “When the little tot saw the enemies, he summoned the bear he used to play with when he was still just a tiny thing. He grabbed the bear by the scruff of his neck, the way he had done before, more than once. He latched on tight to the fur and raced off into the forest on the bear.”</p><p>When she’d said this, Lyubomila turned in the direction of the small grove where their domestic animals lived and shouted:</p><p>“Hey, you brown one, run on over to me. Come on, hurry up!”</p><p>A bear sprang out of the grove and rushed, leaping and bounding, toward Lyubomila. When he took his spot next to her, she petted his snout. She whispered something in his ear. She patted his shoulder, then took hold of his fur and jumped onto the bear’s back.</p><p>“Hey, hey!” she yelled out to the bear.</p><p>The bear ran around in a circle with all his might, until Lyubomila stopped him.</p><p>“But why did he race off into the forest on a bear and not on a horse?” Radomir asked, and Lyubomila replied:</p><p>“A steed can run through a field faster than a bear. But you see, a horsie is helpless in the forest. A bear can find food and shelter in the forest. And a bear will be the best of guards in the forest. That’s the way it is. Let’s go on with the game.</p><p>“The bear set off running for the forest and concealed the child from the enemies in the forest. He kept him safe, the whole time a person was growing up in the forest.</p><p>“When he was grown, one day he saw a girl in the forest, picking berries from a clearing. He liked her – and she him. And they got married. They found a spot on earth that was concealed from unkind eyes and built a homestead and began to have children. And all their relatives, the ones who had once flown off to the stars, came back to them.”</p><p>As he drifted off to sleep, Nikodim thought about the game. He didn’t like it.</p><p>And at this same time, Lyubomila and Radomir were walking through their family homestead and recalling the life they’d lived. It had been entirely joyful for them.</p><p>Lyubomila laughed like a child when Radomir tried to depict her as the little girl standing in the grass.</p><p>“Do you remember? Do you remember the way you shouted back then, that I was a scoundrel – that I’d lifted the hem of your dress? I wiped your tears away with it, and you kept talking about dishonor.”</p><p>“Yes, I remember it all,” his wife answered him through her laughter. “But the thought just now occurred to me: you could have wiped my tears away with your shirt tail.”</p><p>“I was a smart boy. I thought, why should I get my shirt dirty when the dress would have to be washed anyway?”</p><p>“Yes, a smart boy. But all the same, you lifted the hem of my dress, you scoundrel. Goodness, look: new flowers have come up on our spot, on our little wedding hill. Oh, how majestic the cedar has grown. It was just a little thing when we planted it on our wedding day.”</p><p>Lyubomila pressed her palm to the tree trunk and leaned her cheek against it. She fell silent. Radomir, just as much in love with Lyubomila as in days of old, embraced her shoulders and said:</p><p>“Where shall we sleep tonight: here or in the house?”</p><p>“As you wish, my love.”</p><p>In the morning, about fifty soldiers entered the homestead. Among them were two monks in black clothing. The soldiers saw a gray-haired old man standing by a cedar tree. There was an old woman with her back pressed against him. The old folks held two swords each in their hands.</p><p>“There, do you see?” the elder monk shouted to the soldiers. “There, do you see the heathens standing there? Children were born of them, of those heathens. Don’t use arrows – chop them into pieces with your swords.”</p><p>Two warriors approached the old folks from different sides and raised their swords. They tried to strike, but Radomir struck the weapon from one warrior’s hand with his sword. Lyubomila, too, repelled the attack. The old folks repelled the second attack, too, and the third. Then the soldiers began battling each of the old folks in pairs. But Radomir had two swords in his hands and they were like lightning, and he repelled the attacks of two warriors simultaneously, but did not spill the soldiers’ blood.</p><p>Laughing,</p><p> gray-haired Lyubomila, too, repelled the attacks.</p><p>“Retreat, all of you!” shouted the elder monk. “Evil spirits are helping them! Everyone retreat! Everyone, fire at them with your bows.”</p><p>The soldiers with the swords retreated. Other prepared their bows, but when they grasped their bowstrings, the gray-haired old folks suddenly threw down their swords, turned to each other and embraced. Radomir whispered something to Lyubomila, and she smiled at him in reply.</p><p>“What are you waiting for? Let loose your arrows!” screeched the monk. “They are heathens! You are sent by god! Go on, let loose your arrows or I will curse you!”</p><p>An arrow pierced Lyubomila and two pierced Radomir. But the old folks remained standing, embracing as before, as if they were feeling no pain.</p><p>The arrows flew. The earth was sprinkled with blood. And Lyubomila and Radomir sank slowly onto the ground, or perhaps they flew off to the stars. When their bodies lay on the ground, the elder monk – envoy of the priest – whispered to himself as he gazed upon their faces, “They were not thinking of death before they died. Their thought is of life. There is neither fear on their faces, nor sadness. What can I do to prevent them from incarnating anew?” He considered his decision feverishly, fearfully.</p><p>Suddenly there arose an agitated clamor behind the monk. The monk turned and saw six dead soldiers lying beneath an apple tree, and in each one’s hand an apple core. The monk realized what had happened. The high priest’s envoy knew that Vedic Russian gardens bore wonderful fruit, but one could eat them only when the garden’s master offered them. The Vedic Russians treated their trees and flowers like living beings, and they repaid them with their love. When the trees and flowers saw how the newcomers treated the people who had given them their love, the apple tree used its roots to drive different juices from the bowels of the earth into its fruits and imbued its fruit with the strongest of poisons.</p><p>“Don’t touch that! Don’t eat a thing here,” shouted the monk. “I told you – this is a satanic tribe, and the place here is unholy. Chop down everything here, everything. I order you, in the name of the Almighty.”</p><p>“Look,” shouted one soldier. “Look over there.” He pointed at the path leading out of the homestead.</p><p>They all turned and saw a bear rushing in huge bounds along the edge of the garden toward the path. Atop him, with a tight grip on the bear’s fur, lay a little tot. The bear ran out of the homestead and rushed toward the forest.</p><p>“Catch them, catch them,” screeched the monk. “And don’t come back until you’ve chopped that spawn to pieces.”</p><p>He knew that if even one from among the Vedic Russian line were to be saved, then the entire line would be born anew on Earth. He did not speak of this to the soldiers. He kept harping on about the will of god:</p><p>“Catch them! God orders us to clear away from the earth all that is unholy. Do you see how unholy it is here?”</p><p>The detachment’s leader ordered ten warriors to follow the bear, catch him and kill the little tot.</p><p>The soldiers leapt onto their horses and galloped off after the bear.</p><p>Leaping, the bear raced swiftly toward the forest. But the bear couldn’t keep running at that pace for long. And the galloping horses were catching up to him. Slowly, but steadily, the distance between him and the horsemen grew less and less. They were about a hundred meters from the forest when one of the riders reached the bear. He was riding alongside him, and he raised his sword to cut down the child. But the bear suddenly rose up on his hind legs and took the blow himself. And the horse with its rider shied to the side and reared up. The wounded bear surged once more toward the forest. He was only about fifty meters from the forest, but the detachment of riders had now nearly reached him. The swords were at the ready in their hands.</p><p>But the soldiers suddenly saw a rider rush out from the forest on a hurtling steed to cut off the detachment. A gray-haired old man was confidently seated in the saddle. His gray hair and beard were streaming in the wind. And, holding two swords in his hands, the old man steered his steed with his legs:</p><p>“Hey, hey!” the old man shouted and quickened the steed’s wondrous galloping.</p><p>“He’s prepared to do battle with us,” shouted the detachment’s leader. “Prepare to do battle with the crazy elder.”</p><p>“But he’s alone, and there are ten of us. He’s an old man. What’s there to be afraid of?” objected a warrior. “We have to continue the chase.”</p><p>“Yes, he’s alone, but he’s a Vedic Russian. Prepare for battle, those of you who are not cowards.”</p><p>The steed of the elder who had attacked the detachment pranced around the detachment. Using his swords, the old man had knocked the weapons from the hands of the warriors on the edge and managed to cut two steeds’ saddle girths, when an arrow wounded his extraordinary horse.</p><p>But the gray-haired old man did not ride toward the forest on his wounded steed. He rode along the forest’s edge, leading everyone behind him in pursuit. At the forest’s edge, by a pine tree standing on its own, his steed stumbled. It fell. The old man jumped up from the ground and ran to the pine tree. He began searching for something in the grass. The detachment caught up to him.</p><p>The pine tree took seven arrows in its chest, but the eighth pierced Arga’s chest. The Vedic Russian lay on the grass and did not moan. A small stream of blood flowed from his chest. The wooden pine did not know how to cry, and Arga’s thought flew upward, accursed:</p><p>“Of birth anew I shall have no thought,</p><p>To them, for creation, I give it,</p><p>That they may be happy and inspired.</p><p>Incarnate! Meet again and live for evermore!</p><p>Radomir, Lyubomila. Friend am I to you, not foe.”</p><p>The Vedic Russian lay on the grass and did not moan. He was still bearing up, and, his strength ebbing away, he pressed a sweet little statue to his chest.</p><p>“Good will prevail,” he whispered to his beloved, as if delirious. And the wooden pine began to cry. A very strange resin flowed along its trunk.</p><p>Suddenly the Vedic Russian opened his eyes and his gaze was clear. And pronouncing the words with difficulty, he said:</p><p>“Do not grieve, pine. All here is nonsense. My thought will break through the troubled years. The ages of gatherings clear and bright will return once more. Of a morning, my thought will encourage all earthly goddesses: good will prevail.</p><p>The soldiers could not catch up to the bear and the little boy. They tried to enter the forest, but the forest seemed hostile to them. The horses snorted, and the paths disappeared beneath their feet. The soldiers went back and told the monk they had killed the boy.</p><p>Not many years passed, and people began saying that they’d see a boy in the forest – about nine years old or more – while they were hunting for mushrooms. He would look out of the bushes at them, but was afraid to come close. And there was always an old, lame bear by his side.</p><p>And later on, two boys lost their way in the forest. A youth came out to meet the terrified boys. Using gestures, he got them to follow him and led them out to the forest’s border, to a road that led to the settlement, and vanished once more in the forest. After this incident, people stopped being afraid of the forest youth. And a year later, when he appeared before some girls who were collecting berries in a clearing, they weren’t frightened by him and didn’t run away.</p><p>The youth was slim and blue-eyed, his clothing woven of grasses. He stood at the edge of a clearing, and for some reason, he looked only at one girl, a girl named Praskovya. He looked at her and didn’t take his eyes off her, and everyone stopped collecting berries and examined the youth.</p><p>Then, very slowly, so as not to frighten them, he took a few steps toward the group of girls and stopped. Seeing that the maidens didn’t scatter and weren’t afraid of him, he went up to young Praskovya, stood across from her, smoothed his hair and said, pronouncing the words with difficulty:</p><p>“With you, o beautiful goddess, I could create a space of Love for all eternity.”</p><p>Praskovya understood nothing of these words, but for some reason she blushed and began talking to the youth:</p><p>“Where do you live? Everyone says you live alone in the forest.”</p><p>“For now I live alone on the Earth,” the youth replied.</p><p>“Alone? But your parents must live somewhere? A person can’t be without any family.”</p><p>“They do live somewhere. My father and mother, and my older brothers, and my sisters. And my grandfather Radomir and Lyubomila, my grandmother.”</p><p>“But wherever do they live? In the forest, too?”</p><p>“They flew high up and away to the stars. They will all return to the Earth when I find my intended one. I will create a space of Love, and on it will be born our children.”</p><p>“But how will you seek an intended one for yourself in the forest?”</p><p>“I won’t seek her. I’ve already found her.”</p><p>“Well, who is she?”</p><p>“You are the most beautiful of all, o maiden. Please, come with me to my space – I’ve already begun to build it. I’ll build a house. I just need a tool. Lacking a tool, for now I’ve built a hut. I watched from afar and saw how people do that.”</p><p>The maidens, now totally emboldened, whispered amongst themselves, laughing at the youth.</p><p>Without responding to the proposal, Praskovya walked away from the youth and over to the maidens.</p><p>He stood there alone a bit more, then glanced up at the sky, spread out his arms, as if apologizing to someone, and then began slowly leaving the clearing.</p><p>The maidens fell silent. Praskovya was watching him go, and suddenly she said to the youth, confidently and loudly:</p><p>“Wait for me here tomorrow. I’ll swipe a tool from my father, as my dowry.”</p><p>The youth quickly turned and ran up to Praskovya.</p><p>The maidens saw him smile for the first time. And all the girls’ cheeks flushed. The youth’s smile was extraordinary, and his eyes shone.</p><p>“How handsome he is!</p><p> Too bad he didn’t ask me,” whispered one of the girls.</p><p>“I’d go with him,” another suddenly blurted out.</p><p>But the youth, with eyes for no one else around, said:</p><p>“You mustn’t swipe it. That is a bad act.”</p><p>“I was joking. My father will give me everything on his own.”</p><p>From then on, the people never again saw the forest youth and Praskovya, who headed off with him to who knows where.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.220>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>20. There's Meaning to be Found in the Chaos</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“Life went on on Earth. But a different life. The great Vedic Russian civilization, its traditions, rites and culture, which had existed for tens of thousands of years, were replaced by a chaotic, barbaric human social structure. The time of the princes in Rus’ served as its starting point in our state. The slave-owning period began, and it has continued up to the present day.”</p><p>“But was the Vedic Russian civilization destroyed even earlier than that in other places on Earth? Anastasia, I recall you saying that the Vedic Russian way of life existed among peoples who now live within Germany, England, Poland and the Baltic countries.”</p><p>“Yes, I did say that. It was all one people, one language, one culture. Take a close look, Vladimir: after all, they all resemble each other, even in their external appearance. And that despite the fact that their blood has mixed with Asiatic blood for more than two millennia.”</p><p>“But why, Anastasia? Why did things turn out that way? You said it was a great civilization, a great culture, but they destroyed that civilization just like that, with swords and fire and arrows.”</p><p>“They didn’t destroy it, Vladimir. That word doesn’t fit here. If even just nine people living on the planet are aspiring to gain knowledge of a Divine existence on earth, then the Vedic Russian civilization lives. And after all, not nine people, but hundreds of thousands are discovering the truth within them more and more and are changing their way of life. Soon they will number in the millions, but before this can transpire, the hundreds of thousands need to seek out the answer to this riddle on their own, within themselves. They need to grasp the reason for the catastrophe that has occurred.”</p><p>“And if they don’t grasp it? Out there on the internet, on our site, lots of people have been trying to identify it for several years now – the mistake mankind made during the age of the image. There’s a section there. That’s what it’s called: ‘The Mistake of the Age of the Image.’ But people haven’t yet identified that mistake.</p><p>“There are many hypotheses, but there’s no one answer they agree on. Maybe there won’t be for a thousand more years. Or maybe people won’t be able to identify it at all?”</p><p>“They will be able to. Perhaps in a day, or in five to ten years. They’ll identify it.”</p><p>“Why are you so sure?”</p><p>“Judge for yourself, Vladimir: not so very long ago, they weren’t even talking about it at all. No one was even making an attempt to think along those lines. Now you yourself tell me that a great many people are striving to discern this secret. The thought has been engaged, and like the seed’s sprout, it will find its way to the light.”</p><p>“Maybe someday it’ll find it. People are basically moving along in the flow of their everyday activities. You and your grandfathers have the opportunity to do a lot more reflection. And you possess a greater volume of information about the past, too. And you know, you also have your own opinion. Why not share it? Why not give us a hint?”</p><p>“In other words, Vladimir, you want me to turn off people’s thought?”</p><p>“What do you mean, I want you to turn it off? Why would a hint do that?”</p><p>“When all the people who are currently trying to solve this riddle with their own thought accept the hint as truth, then they’ll immediately bring their own thought’s work to a standstill.</p><p>“Then they’ll expect other hints. And they will instantly rain down from all directions. That’s what’s happening even now. Every hour people are fed suggestions about what’s beneficial for them to eat and drink. About how they should dress, where they should vacation, how to live, where to look for God. And what comes of it? Life grows worse and worse all the time. God created the universe through thought. He gave thought to man. Someone is always trying to bring it to a standstill.”</p><p>“You mean you know the solution, but you don’t want to tell people?”</p><p>“I don’t know it. I have a conjecture.”</p><p>“Well then, tell me, for example, what are your conjectures?”</p><p>“It may be that a period of chaos, of mistakes, is necessary so that mankind can record them and not repeat them as they move forward. Such things occur in history at a time when mankind is on the cusp of a great discovery. A discovery of Universal scope.”</p><p>“That’s a good and encouraging conjecture. Anastasia, your story about the Vedic Russian family, about Lyubomila and Radomir, ended on a very sad note. It’s not at all like your perpetual optimism.”</p><p>“Vladimir, why did you conclude that the story has come to an end? Life goes on, and that means that we can’t think of a single tale of life as having ended.”</p><p>“I remember that the great-grandson Nikodim went off with Praskovya and carried on the family line, but I still feel sorry for the individual people – Radomir and Lyubomila and the others. It’s impossible to continue their story. You can only talk about the continuation of the family line. If there’s anything you can tell me, then please tell me some more, Anastasia.”</p><p>“Very well. In the near future I’ll tell of the events that transpired.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.221>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>21. Courtship Gatherings</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“The time has come when people have begun to see that we need to look for our beloved. We used to be told that a couple was destined to find each other through fate’s intervention. Of course that’s the case, but you know, a person can direct fate himself, too. Or at least give fate a signal about what the person himself wants it to do.</p><p>“And people in various cities began organizing special events that help soul mates meet each other. And that even use some of the rites from the Vedic Russian period, after redoing them a little to adapt them to modern life.</p><p>“So in the fall, when all the summer activities were coming to an end, they’d arrange big gatherings in various cities. Young people and middle-aged people who didn’t yet have a happy family would come together to attend them.</p><p>“By and large, these are your readers, Vladimir. Those among them who have set out to create homesteads in which their happy family line will get their start.</p><p>“It would happen that these gatherings would go on for two or three months in various cities. Your readers would spread the word about them beforehand. And they would come from various places and countries. Some would come for a week, some for a month. And the readers had a greater advantage over all those who were striving to create a happy family. All those who came together had a common goal: an awareness and a vision of how to build their future family’s happy life.”</p><p>“Wait a minute, Anastasia. But why did the readers in particular have a great advantage? I mean, lots of married couples who aren’t my readers have a common goal. Look, for example, performers often start families. But the majority of them get divorced, and often more than once. There’s a common goal, and the same aspirations, but no happy life.”</p><p>“You and I are speaking of different goals, Vladimir. A profession cannot and should not be the goal of a person’s life. If that sort of thing occurs, a person debases himself.</p><p>“Consider this: there’s the profession of salesperson. Is it really fitting for a son of God or for His daughter to consider selling their life’s goal? Or driving a car, or washing laundry or constantly going to a factory or a plant and doing the same thing over and over again each day?”</p><p>“Anastasia, the professions you’ve listed – they may be necessary, but still, they’re not prestigious. But there are prestigious ones or, to be more precise, ones all people hold in high esteem. A famous surgeon, for example, or an astronaut or a military commander, a marshal, or the president of a country.”</p><p>“Their significance lies only in the fact that they create a greater illusion of importance and significance than the others. Who knows, perhaps a person who became a military commander or a president was purposely seduced using the illusory importance of his profession, his position, so that his soul – a soul capable of performing Universal deeds – wouldn’t have the chance to develop. His deeds are not of interest to God. Now, when a man himself personally built a heavenly space on Earth and became the patriarch of a happy family line, his deeds were like unto God’s, and he himself became god.</p><p>“And the readers who would come to the gatherings had a noble goal, shared by the women and men alike. Their advantage lay in that the men and women created their own images of life and their future family in their dreams. When they met with one another, they had a conversation topic of interest to them both.</p><p>“And you are aware, Vladimir, how often spouses in families today have no shared topic of interest to discuss. They have no activities in common, no common aspirations. Two people get married and live together in the same house, but each is thinking his own thoughts and dreaming his own dreams. These people become strangers to each other, and their life together only irritates them.</p><p>“Single people would come to the gatherings, but even though they didn’t know each other, they were closer to each other than those who were married.</p><p>“They would go on tours, arrange fashion shows in which women of all ages took part.</p><p> Then the men would participate. In these shows they displayed clothing that had been sewn by the women themselves or bought in stores.</p><p>“In the evenings, either in the squares or in a clearing somewhere, they’d play the courtship games I told you about, ‘Streamlet,’ for example.</p><p>“And they weren’t shy and they didn’t hide the fact that they were looking for a companion. And women with children who had no husband would bring their children along with them to the courtship gatherings. And they’d explain the goal of the trip to their children. They were aided in their search by their children’s participation and their thought. Look, here I’ll show you a picture of what people would do at the gatherings.</p><p>“Here’s a summer theatre beneath the open sky, and the seating area is full of people of various ages, and children.</p><p>“Here they would introduce themselves to each other from the stage. Those who were on the braver side would come out on stage, and they were given five or ten minutes to tell about themselves and answer questions. Sometimes they’d speak of themselves in a joking manner. They might sing a ditty-prattle and do a little dance. They had complete freedom in their presentation. Take a look.</p><p>“A girl of about twenty-five has come out on the stage. She’s got a fashionable hairdo, and she’s dressed in a form-fitting outfit. After taking only two steps toward the microphone, she suddenly did a somersault and began to laugh. Then she took a stroll along the stage, the way a professional model walks a runway, spinning around. She adjusted her hairdo, walked up to the microphone and playfully said:</p><p>“‘Well, men, what do you think – quite a beauty?’</p><p>“Laughter rang out in the audience, there was applause, and the girl continued telling about herself in a joking manner.</p><p>“‘My main selling point isn’t my appearance. I graduated from the Academy of family homesteads ‘with honors.’ I can cook food ‘with honors,’ I can drive any ailment out of the body with infusions, and I can make up the most extraordinary bed. I can give birth to epic hero children…</p><p>“‘I’m not offering myself to anyone. I’m announcing a competition amongst the men. And it’s not a simple competition. A candidate can present himself in whatever way he wants. The one who wins will be the one I fall in love with.’</p><p>“After the maiden, a little boy came out on stage and he said:</p><p>“‘Hello. I’m Dima. That’s what they call me. And I’m eleven years old. Well, actually, not quite eleven, but I will be soon, in December. My mom’s name is Svetlana, or Svetlana Nikolaevna. She works as a very good cook in a restaurant. She used to work, but now she doesn’t work in the restaurant. First she cried when she stopped working, but now she makes really good meals for various rich people for the holidays. She put an announcement in the newspaper, and they call her on the phone.</p><p>“‘I go to school. Mom says I’m not a very good student, but I know I am. I just don’t need A’s. C’s are enough for me.</p><p>“‘My mom and I came here to meet her future husband, and a dad for me. Then we’ll have a good, close family. My mom is a really good person. She’s pretty, even though she just can’t manage to lose weight. She’s still pretty, though. Mom and I have spent a lot of evenings discussing how we’ll live as a family. Right now we live in a one-room apartment we have to pay money for. But once we’re living as a family, we’ll build a house and put in a garden.</p><p>“‘They’ve already given Mom some land, and we spent a whole month living there in a tent over the summer. That was good.</p><p>“‘She, my mom, didn’t come out on stage with me – she’s too shy. But I say to her, you have to come out. If you don’t come out, then why did we come here and spend a lot of money, money we put aside for the house?</p><p>“‘Mom, come out on onstage,’ the boy said, addressing the audience.</p><p>“But no one came up on the stage, and then the people sitting in the audience began to clap, urging the boy’s mom to go up on stage.</p><p>“A short, slightly plump woman about thirty years of age made her way to the stage. Blushing in embarrassment, she stood next to the little boy and hugged her son’s shoulders, but didn’t say a thing. Then the boy, all business, pulled a little piece of paper from his pants pocket, unfolded it and began reading what was written on the paper:</p><p>“‘Mom and I live in the Bryansk region, in the city of Novozybkov. There used to be radiation there, but now there’s less radiation, and there will be less still. Here at the gathering we’re registered under number 2015. If anyone wants to, they can write to us. That’s all.’</p><p>“The mom took the boy by the hand, and they went to the stage exit, accompanied by the audience’s applause. But at the edge of the stage, the boy suddenly pulled his hand free and quickly, almost running, went back up to the microphone once again:</p><p>“‘I also forgot to say – I didn’t write it down, that’s why I forgot. My mom can play the guitar and sing pretty songs while she plays the guitar, even if they are sad ones. And she can also paint. She painted the garden and the house. And I’ll also help build the family. And I’ll help build the house, too. When they had the elections in our city for the deputies, I got paid money to put up leaflets on the fences. And there will be more elections soon.’</p><p>“The audience began clapping again, and the boy went back to his mother. Hand in hand, they headed to the stage exit and took their seats.</p><p>“Four men immediately got up from the audience and headed for the microphone. The first one to come up, limping slightly, was a man of about forty. But others from the other side of the floor outran him, and he ended up last in line for the microphone. The men who came up to the microphone told about themselves, but they didn’t come right out and offer to marry the woman, since it wasn’t customary at gatherings to propose publicly. You had to write it. But the fact that they came out on stage already showed their desire to get to know the woman and her son better. When it was the slightly limping man’s turn, he approached the microphone and said:</p><p>“‘My name is Ivan. I live in Moscow in my own apartment. I’ll be forty years old soon. I’m a former paratrooper officer. Decommissioned as disabled three years ago. I’ve been earning money in a multilevel marketing business, and I’m sick of it. I’ve still got a camping tent, an ax and a kettle. Basically, my comrades gave me the paratrooper paraphernalia. I dream of pitching this tent in the Bryansk region on the outskirts of Novozybkov. Next to yours, Dima. I’ll work to earn the land granted for relocation of the tent. I’ve been trained to build a dug-out, and I think I can erect a log house. Only I don’t know how to do a garden and vegetable garden.’</p><p>“Dima, who had sprung from his seat, called out from the audience, ‘I know how. I’ll show you.’</p><p>“A day later, Svetlana Nikolaevna, her son Dima and Ivan the former paratrooper officer, departed the gathering.</p><p>“Anastasia, can you tell me, please, how did the fate of these three people play out?”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.222>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>22. The Marriage Rite for Women with Children</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“Their fate played out well. Ivan invited Svetlana and her son to visit him, and they stayed in his apartment for a week, and after that they corresponded with each other. When spring came, Ivan rented his Moscow apartment out for a good sum and left for the city of Novozybkov. He pitched his camping tent alongside Svetlana and Dima’s tent. The former paratrooper had everything one needs for camping out. Even a camp heater for the tent. Ivan threw himself enthusiastically into digging a trench to go under the foundation of the future house. And Dima, who’d come out on weekends with his mom, threw himself into helping even more enthusiastically. When summer vacation began, all three of them began living in tents. They’d gather together by the campfire every evening and discuss plans for the future homestead.</p><p>“One day, when it was getting close to time to go to sleep and the fire was burning down, Dima said:</p><p>“‘In normal families, the husband and wife sleep together in one room and their children sleep in another. How about if I sleep in your tent, Ivan, and you and Mom sleep in ours?’</p><p>“‘But we’re not husband and wife yet,’ Svetlana objected.</p><p>“Ivan stood up, held his hand out to Svetlana, helped her stand up and, solemnly said, a bit agitated:</p><p>“‘With you, o beautiful goddess, and with our fine young son, I could create a space of Love for all eternity.’</p><p>“Svetlana quietly answered him:</p><p>“‘We are prepared to help you in the great co-creation.’</p><p>“Dima jumped to his feet and clapped his hands. Then, beneath the starry sky they performed the rite of marriage and became husband and wife, and at the same time they performed the rite of adoption, and Dima became Ivan’s natural son.</p><p>“Anastasia, did you maybe mean to say that Dima the boy became Ivan’s adopted son?”</p><p>“He became his natural son. Ivan became Dima’s natural father.”</p><p>“But Anastasia, how can something like that happen? I mean, that contradicts all the laws of biology.”</p><p>“But it doesn’t contradict Heaven. The Vedic Russians knew the laws of Heaven. Ivan, Dima and Svetlana knew the Vedic Russian rite of marriage for women who already had children. And so they performed it.”</p><p>“What rite? How did they know it?”</p><p>“You described it.”</p><p>“I never wrote about it.”</p><p>“Vladimir, I’m talking about events that will occur in the future. And you will write about the rite. I’ll tell you about it.</p><p>“It is thoughts that carry the greatest force in it, the desire of three people to build a future together. The woman plays the main role in preparing for this rite. The woman must be able to explain to the child that it’s essential to live as a family, essential to have a father and to create</p><p> a homestead together with him, to build a home and put in a garden. When that desire arises – is born – in the child, she needs to involve him in the search for the future spouse and father. Every mother knows her child better than anyone else, and there’s no one method for achieving the desired result. It can be different for each mother. What’s most important is to reach the goal.</p><p>“It can take a very long time for many children to experience the desire for a person to appear in their mother’s life, in their home. And until the child experiences the desire to have a father and to search for him along with his mother, then it’s best not to bring anyone into the home.</p><p>“Only in the beginning does the mother play the main role in preparing for the rite of marriage. At the moment when the rite is performed, it’s the child’s thought that provides the main energetic force.</p><p>“If the man and woman have decided to live together, and the woman’s child is very small, they may live together without performing the rite until the child gets a bit older and is able to consciously understand the essence of family life. And the man and woman need to make a joint effort to bring about his conscious understanding. If, as he grows up, the child thinks his stepfather as his natural father, the rite of marriage is nonetheless essential, since the rite is capable of making the father and the adoptive son or daughter relatives, both in spirit and in blood. This rite can have a huge beneficial effect only if it is performed on the land of the future family homestead. It doesn’t depend on whether the man began building it first, or the woman. What’s important is that it be to everyone’s liking, first of all the child’s.</p><p>“The rite should take place beneath the open starry sky. A campfire should be burning, or three candles. Svetlana and Ivan were lucky: after they both declared their desire to build a life together, there were many stars in the sky above them, the fire was still burning, and they didn’t have to wait until a different night. They could get married right away. And they did everything correctly.</p><p>“Ivan and Svetlana stood before Dima, and Ivan was the first to speak, after he’d looked up at the stars:</p><p>“‘Here, on the land of the family homestead, I want to lead our family line to a happy life. Build a house, put in a garden.</p><p>“‘I ask you, Dima, to give me your consent so that I may marry your mother for all eternity, so that you may become my natural son.’</p><p>“‘I will be very glad for you, Ivan, to live with Mom and with me. I might even become a better student. And may I call you Dad?’</p><p>“‘Of course,’ Ivan replied.</p><p>“Then Svetlana spoke up, too:</p><p>“‘Thank you, Son. You helped me seek out a husband. I am prepared to become a faithful wife. A wife must take care of her husband. Son, please allow me, too, to dote on Ivan, your father.’</p><p>“‘Of course, Mama. Definitely, dote on Ivan. And I will dote on him, too. Let’s buy Papa a new artificial leg. I’ve seen the way he wraps duct tape around his old one.’</p><p>“You don’t necessarily need to always say the same words in the given rite. What’s central in it is the thought, which needs to be heard by the planets that happen to be above the couple being married and their child or children at that moment. In order for this to happen, each of the participants must take some water from a wide-mouthed vessel they’ve previously brought along – a glass or mug – take no fewer than three swallows, then pour water on their palm and bathe their hair with it. Then the three of them lie down on the grass for no less than ten minutes, head to head, take each other’s hands and look at the starry sky, mentally asking the planets above them to help their family line build a happy life and asking for love to settle in their family homestead. And that is what will happen if the thought of the three of them is sincere and strong.</p><p>“It’s not essential for love to be strong at the moment of marriage. It’s enough if there’s mutual affection or attraction. Strong love will definitely come. For example, among the Vedic Russians, it almost always appeared within a year or two.</p><p>“This rite is among the strongest. It is not an occult rite. When astronomers and psychologists bring retrieve just a portion of the knowledge that people possessed in the past, they’ll grasp its cosmic power.</p><p>“Vladimir, do you understand? The plants, the water, the Earth, the planets and human thought all participate in this rite. Merging with the people’s common desire, it draws the elements and the Divine essence of the Cosmos to itself for the greater good.</p><p>“After all, Vladimir, you know how closely the little blades of grass and flowers and bugs and all that’s alive on Earth interact with the planets. Water forms high and low tides under the planets’ influence.</p><p>“And of course, to a great extent, man’s life is created under the planets’ influence, but in the given case, by performing such a rite, three people who have merged into one are telling – or asking – the planets to strengthen their bond for the greater good. The request man makes of the planets – when his goal is in accord with God’s program – is a great gift, and it glorifies itself and man. His conscious and sincere request leads a great number of planets in the heavens into an exalted and serene acceleration. At that moment, the heavenly bodies above the people who are lying there form an unspoken alliance amongst themselves, agreeing to help these people in their deeds.</p><p>“A sage made this discovery, and he spent ninety years on the path to his discovery, observing the planets and correlating them with people’s deeds.</p><p>“When the learned sages tried to make sense of this rite, they came to the conclusion that in some miraculous way, the planets or the force of cosmic energies erase a person’s unpleasant memories of the past from his memory, thereby freeing up space for new, light sensations.</p><p>“These energies also rapturously transform the three people into a family, related by blood.</p><p>“Now you, Vladimir, you were telling me about telegony and that modern science has become aware of how certain energies take part in forming the physical bodies of animals and people. Please note – the energies are not visible to the eye, and they are not enclosed in visible matter, but their power is effective. And what’s more, they participate at a person’s behest. When they act at a person’s behest, then their actions become a hundred times more powerful.</p><p>“It’s important to note that the heart of the rite is that it is an opposite sort of telegony: it is not the intrusion of an old connection into a new union. Rather, it drives out all the energies of the old connection and imparts new strength, gives new life.”</p><p>“Wow. This rite is so, so short, but has an extraordinary effect. It makes people family.”</p><p>“So short? Vladimir, think carefully. The preparation for this, as you said, short rite takes more than a year. Two important customs precede this rite.</p><p>“Let me tell you about the first: the mother must prepare her child. Then – and pay attention here, Vladimir – at the beginning Ivan said that he wanted to pitch his tent and work on the land to earn his spot.</p><p>“This is a procedure from a different rite. Each bobyl – that’s what they used to call bachelors who were on the older side – had to spend a month once each year working on the land of a woman who was a widow or who lived with children. He didn’t have to work the whole month for the same widow. A bobyl could spend a week with one and then hire himself out to another. Now naturally, this custom didn’t exist to help single women around the farm. Its goal was to help people get to know each other and help them create a family. The bobyl would come to a widow and say:</p><p>“‘Mistress, I’m looking for work for myself. Perhaps you have something for me to do?’</p><p>“If the woman took a dislike to him right from the start, she’d answer:</p><p>“All the work has already been done on my farm. What’s more, I’m unable at present to offer pay.’</p><p>“If the woman took a liking to the man, she’d give him some task for two or three days. Then she’d give him another assignment. His mastery or skill at the work weren’t important. The main thing was whether the people were to each other’s liking or not.</p><p>“If they were to each other’s liking, then the woman could ask the man to stay for longer than a month, and if he did stay, then he was called a primak. And after they’d been working the land together for a year, they could either marry or go their separate ways.”</p><p>“Tell me, Anastasia: after you do this rite, do you have to go to the marriage bureau and get married?”</p><p>“You can observe any conventions you wish, if they’re necessary in your life, but they won’t in any way interfere with what is most important.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.223>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>23. High Society Women</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>As I was finishing the previous chapter, it occurred to me that we could make good use of this kind of rite these days, too. People in many regions of Russia today – primarily readers of the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series – are coming together in groups, each taking a hectare of land and planting gardens there, building houses and establishing up their small motherland. For the most part, they are doing this as families. But there are a significant number of single women in these groups. I’ve most often visited a settlement outside the city of Vladimir. There are now more than sixty homesteads being built in this settlement. The children who have been born on them are already growing up. But there are also single women. They took a hectare of land and are building their homesteads, sometimes with their children’s help, but sometimes all on their own. Can you imagine? A woman builds a house all on her own and puts in</p><p> a garden. She’s establishing not just a small little dacha on six sotkas, but a real homestead. Do they have a hard time doing this? In the material sense, yes. I know one woman who rents out her apartment in Moscow and is using the money she gets to build a house in a field.</p><p>Because she doesn’t have much in the way of financial resources, she isn’t always able to hire skilled workers, and she carries out a significant portion of the work herself. And she does this joyfully. She has a goal and the joy of moving toward the goal, and even if it’s slowly, this still compensates for the difficulties, and she seems not to notice them.</p><p>When I familiarized myself with information I was getting from various settlements, I decided I had to write a book about them, right away. It will be a truly historic book. Our descendants need to know how their happy, new civilization began to be built, and by whom.</p><p>But for now I asked the wife of one of the founders of the “Rodnoye” (“Native”) settlement in the Vladimir region to describe the unmarried women and their work. Here are her short descriptions:</p><p>Yevgeniya T. – born in Moldova, 53 years of age, a geologist and beautiful – her smile outshines a Hollywood smile. She doesn’t go to Malakhovka, outside of Moscow, where her apartment is located, saying, “My home is here.”</p><p>She came here in 2003 to have a look. She went into the forest to gather mushrooms.</p><p>“They warned me,” as Yevgeniya tells the story, “‘this isn’t your usual forest.’ I replied, ‘I’m a geologist. I won’t get lost.’ I wandered around in a radius of three kilometers for 12 hours! I got back around midnight, dead on my feet. ‘This is the spot for me!’ I rented out my apartment in Malakhovka for 10,500 rubles. With this money I began building, rented a house in Studentsovo next to my plot of land. The stove hadn’t been lit for about 10 years and the house was lopsided. I pulled a nest out of the pipe – I hadn’t been able to light the wood stove. I spent the winter in the village alone. Sometimes I’d visit Konyaevo. I skimped on firewood. I’d only make a fire every other time. In the fall I made the foundation and put up a 4 meter x 4 meter log bathhouse building. All winter I caulked the house with oakum. Now I know what falling snowflakes sound like. Inside the house, I’d walk around in three pairs of pants, three sweaters, a coat and hat. But outside I was lightly dressed – I was working. In the spring I used a knife to remove the remains of the bark from the wood house. Now my house has been planed. I hear the snow melting. I need a wood stove-setter. I dress warmly, take my fishing pole (without a hook.) I go to a pond where the guys fish. I let my line down into the ice hole (God forbid the guys should see my ‘tackle’) and chat with the guys – I’m ‘fishing’ for a stove-setter. And if I need a tractor, I go out onto the road and stop the first one I see.”</p><p>Her vegetable garden is in perfect order and everything is growing. During the first year she made a bathroom and a summer kitchen out of wattle fencing. When there’s nothing at all to eat, she eats kasha with fish oil. She’s a great cook. She’s driven everyone crazy with how busy she is – the locals run from us – but her house is already standing! She speaks her mind.</p><p>Lyubov E. – born in the Far East, 58 years of age. She lived for 27 years in Perm and 20 in Tsimlyansk in the Rostov region. She’s an ichthyologist and has worked in a fish conservancy. Now she’s retired. She has an 84-year-old mother and a 30-year-old son who lives in Perm (with her two grandchildren) and an 18-year-old son who lives in Tsimlyansk.</p><p>This year she began counting back in time – she says that now she’ll be 57. She began setting up her homestead in the fall of 2003. She came for 10 days, moved down the weeds and planted a fence (fir trees, pines, birches, aspens, lindens and maples.) Her plot is in perfect order. In the winter she came with 50,000 rubles – her mother’s entire savings – and put up a log house and covered it with tarpaper. In the spring, she came out with her ex-husband – he dropped her off on his way to Perm. They worked on the plot together. She says, “If things had been like this before, I wouldn’t have left him…” She came in the summer, on July 6th. (She was in a big hurry – she wanted to make it in time for the Ivan Kupala celebration.) She loves holidays so much – she sings and plays the guitar and dances. She has a 2,000 ruble pension. She left her job for the summer – she had enough money. All she needed was money for the trip here. We helped her out with bricks, cement and timber. Within a month, all on her own, she’d made a foundation for the wood stove, laid the foundation for the log house, made pillars to hold the floor joists, caulked the whole house, made an awning shed and put in a summer stove. She hauled wheelbarrows full of rocks, sand and gravel. She thought she wouldn’t be able to do it – but she was! She’s grown stronger and has slimmed down, and she’s begun swimming back and forth across the lake (she didn’t use to be able to do that.) She looks about 10 years younger (and all she was hoping for was a year.) Her eyes shine, there’s a constant smile on her face, and she’s friendly and gets along with everyone. She’s building her house for herself and her mom, and they’re planning on moving into it in the spring. She would like her son and the grandchildren to be able to come, for now just to visit, and then they’ll see how it goes from there. There’s no money, and she’s not expecting to get any from anywhere. There’s an antique Italian violin that her father brought back from the war, and 15 years ago some experts said it was worth at least $10,000-$15,000, even without any repair. She’s really hoping to sell it – a violin should be played and not sit in a museum. If she manages to sell it, things will go more quickly, and if not, then she’ll have to do everything herself. But after all, you can’t put in floors and ceilings without lumber. She worries about the fact that she doesn’t have any money, but she keeps working on the house. She’ll come back in September for another month. During the winter, she was in Perm with her grandchildren, and she stopped by her field for one day, so she could walk around, spend a little time, even though there was a direct train to Rostov…</p><p>Natalya D. – born in Vologda. She came from Moscow and has two children, 2- and 5-year-old little girls.</p><p>She’s been living in a tent since the end of May. She’s divorced from her husband and wants to take her children out of the city so they won’t be trained in the system. It’s been a cold, rainy summer. Not a single complaint. They delivered an old construction trailer, and she scraped and cleaned everything in it. She really wants to line and winterize it. She’s buying up lumber. She doesn’t have any money. The husband gives the kids money for food. She’s currently living with her children, earning money in the field and helping men build foundations. She dreams of staying on her homestead, and if that doesn’t work out this winter, then definitely next winter. She’s studying all possible house plans that she could build on her own (a cob house or a dug-out.) The children have calmed down and are happier.</p><p>When she goes over to Lyuba E.’s house and sees what she’s been able to do, then she says, “If you could do it, then I can, too. After all, I’m younger and stronger.” And she can!</p><p>She’s always smiling, and she sings beautifully. She’s a college graduate. A beautiful soul.</p><p>Forgive me for being so emotional – I love all of them very much…</p><p>Nadezhda Z. – a farmer from Belarus. After Chernobyl, they lived outside of Azov and for a year in Poretskoe, outside of Suzdal (while they were waiting for a field,) and for the last year she’s been living in Konyaevo (in someone else’s house.)</p><p>In the summer she began building her own house. For now her two grown children live in Moscow. Her daughter and sister from Belarus got plots. They all want to come live together. Her husband and children work, and Nadezhda takes care of the farm, directs the construction and is building the house herself. She danced in a professional ensemble for many years and has a ballerina’s posture. When she’s hauling a wheelbarrow full of manure, you won’t be able to take your eyes off her! On her farm she has 2 dogs, 4 cats (to keep away the mice,) rabbits, chickens (of the Smirnov breed, which was preserved during the Revolution on small farms,) a goat and doves. In her house there’s a sea of all possible flowers, simple and exotic alike. She has an encyclopedic knowledge of all topics that are relevant to her. Her husband and children are supportive of her, but she has to do everything herself. For the time being they have a different life. She’s building the future, firmly and confidently. Not long ago she broke her right hand – she fell off the bike her children had given her for her fiftieth birthday so she’d be able to get everywhere when she needed to. She took a break only for a day. The next day she was already raking up the hay (for the animals for the winter.) Now she’s painting and planning boards. Ask her, “How?” and she’ll answer, “I use just my left hand.” She’s always smiling, loves to sing, is the life of any party, beloved by all, a walking library, and our consultant. Tiny, with a good figure, and the support of the whole family. She manages to do everything, everywhere: the house, the construction, the animals, the garden, the provisions… And her liqueurs!!! She doesn’t have any apartment anywhere she can go back to, any house. By the time fall comes, she’ll have to give up her house in the village – the owners are coming back. She’ll spend the winter in her new home!</p><p>I received this information a year ago. Now all the heroines mentioned here have already finished building their houses and have</p><p>
 no intention of abandoning their goal. It’s probably these very women people have in mind when they say, “She’d stop a galloping horse and run into a burning hut.” And I’d add, “She’ll build a homestead herself and lead a man into eternity.” But where is this man of hers? How will she meet him, if she’s busy with her great work from dawn to dusk?</p><p>And how many young and youthful women in various corners of our country are dreaming of creating a family homestead! And it would be good if they were able to find their helpmate before they create it.</p><p>And so it occurred to me: what if I organized a database where women like these could register, and men could visit them as temp workers? Maybe they’d be able to choose an intended for themselves, too. It shouldn’t be the men choosing the women. The women should be doing the choosing.</p><p>There’s a phrase, “high society women,” which refers to a woman who’s part of the so-called elite party scene of the rich or famous. But what kind of high society is that, if these parties offer society nothing at all, aside from gossip on the pages of the tabloids? But a great many men have noted that when you marry a woman from the party scene, you’re in for nothing but tantrums and extravagant demands.</p><p>And so what I think, is that high society women are actually those married and unmarried women who are building their family homesteads today, who are planning to give birth to healthy children on them or pass what they’ve built along to the children they’ve already had.</p><p>Both individual men and the state as a whole will receive nothing but benefit from them. The children they give birth to will personify the future civilization.</p><p>And Anastasia’s grandfather was 100% right when he said it’s essential for questions regarding the family to be resolved on the government level. Russian families themselves – and not just Russian families – know better than anyone how they’re being resolved these days.</p><p>We have to somehow solve the question of how to put on events that can offer these women assistance or that can, more accurately, help men meet women who are establishing their small motherland.</p><p>I ask the administrators of the “Anastasia.ru” site to think about how to improve the site’s “Acquaintances” rubric. So that each unmarried woman and man among my readers can put up their address and contact info on it. I remind those who don’t have computers that nearly every city has Internet cafes where you can read messages from sites. There are also mail centers that pass information along via the Internet.</p><p>For my part, I’ll include here the text of my appeal to the men of all countries where my books are published, and I ask all the translators of Europe and America to give it special emphasis.</p><p>Gentlemen,</p><p>Many of you, especially those whose family life hasn’t worked out, would like to meet that one special woman with whom you can experience the joy of a life together. But where can you find a woman like that? Pretty much the only way is to go through one of numerous marriage agencies. But please note that nearly all of them focus on giving out the external data and age, while touching only lightly on character and life’s aspirations. And even this “lightly” is not trustworthy. But trustworthiness… Women pop up who openly offer their youth, beauty and smile, who are ready to sign a pre-nuptial agreement with you, assuming you’re rich and can provide them with material benefits. Cafes already exist in Moscow where beautiful women who are competing for rich husbands gather. This is not a new phenomenon. “Well, what’s the harm of that?” a man might think. “I have enough financial resources and can afford to sign a pre-nup with a young beauty. Let her humor me in bed, and let people envy me at high-society parties. After all, as they say, ‘spend time with the young and you get younger, too.’” That’s all quite true, but there’s one “but.” What is the young woman who’s living with you thinking and dreaming of? After all, she’s a live person and is capable of falling for someone, capable of love, but you are not the object of her love, not by a long shot. And so then she decides she wants to get rid of you – you’re an obstacle on her path to happiness. And even if she doesn’t take out a contract on you, although, as we all know, things like that do happen, even if she doesn’t slip something harmful into your morning coffee, it’s enough if she has thoughts – even subconsciously – about getting you out of the way. And in this way, while you’re thinking that you’re bringing a kind and affectionate beauty into your house, what you’re actually bringing into your house is a poisonous snake. The only difference is in the way they look on the outside, and so, instead of putting this snake in an aquarium with thick glass, you’re laying her next to you in bed.</p><p>But women have also popped up – perhaps as a counterweight to the pernicious phenomena of our life – who are heralds of a new, happy civilization. They, the ones who are building family homesteads, are not simply putting a roof over their heads. They’re establishing the beginning of a new life. The beginning!</p><p>A dying billionaire will bounce back and find youth when he meets a woman like that. A thriving businessman will wither on the vine without her. It’s not money that prolongs your life, but the thought of your beloved and the space of Love that the two of you create together. They don’t simply prolong it. By providing the conditions for swift and conscious reincarnation, they make life eternal.</p><p>No matter what words I write, no matter what arguments I put forth, they won’t touch your heart the way your heart can be touched by meeting these women. Try your best to get to know these earthly goddesses of eternity.</p><p>And perhaps your meeting will resemble the one Anastasia described.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.224>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>24. A Meeting Millennia Later</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>A girl of about twenty-five named Lyuba came to one of the days of the courtship gatherings. Lyuba was dressed in a simple skirt that fell just below her knees and an embroidered linen top. On her shoulder was a small purse on a strap. Lyuba didn’t have many outfits. The girl was walking along the street in hopes of finding some kind of lodging in a private house. During the courtship gatherings, all the rooms in hotels and boarding houses had already been reserved beforehand. In any case, the girl didn’t have the money to pay for an expensive hotel room, which is why she was looking for simpler lodging. But it wasn’t easy to find private lodging while the courtship gatherings were going on. Not particularly hopeful, Lyuba addressed a woman who was coming out of the gate of a private house:</p><p>“Hello. Could you tell me, please, whether you might have room in your house where I could stay for the night? Preferably, on the less expensive side.”</p><p>The woman answered, “There’s no point in looking, my dear. Everything’s been full for a long time. Everyone who comes arranges their lodging beforehand with an apartment agency. Don’t waste your time. Go to the train station, although you won’t even find a place to sit down there, either.”</p><p>“Thank you for the advice. That’s what I’ll do, most likely,” Lyuba replied and set off along the street in the direction of the train station.</p><p>“Hold on, Dear. Come here,” the woman called out to her, and Lyuba went back over to her.</p><p>“Here’s something you can do. Try knocking or ringing at that house, the one four doors down from me. There’s a doorbell on the gate there. Push that button. Maybe the old granny will come out – she looks like Baba Yaga. She’s a Greek, with a hooked nose. My husband said that all young Greek girls are beautiful, but the old ones are like witches. So, Dear, go ahead and ask her to put you up. Back when her man was still alive, she used to take a lot of people in, but he died, and since then – this is the third year she hasn’t taken in a single person, but you give it a try. Ask her. She might just take you in.”</p><p>“Thank you. I’ll try that,” said Lyuba. And she walked up to the house the woman had indicated. She pressed the button once, and after a minute, she pushed the button on the gate again, but no one came out. Ten minutes passed, the door creaked, and a hunchbacked old woman came out of the house. Groaning, she made her way toward the gate along the path that was overgrown with grapevines. She opened the gate and began talking without even saying hello.</p><p>“What are you breaking down my gate for, Girl?” she asked discontentedly.</p><p>“I’d like to ask you to put me up. A kind woman, your neighbor, suggested it.”</p><p>“She’s not kind. She was having a laugh at you. I haven’t taken anyone in for a long time now.”</p><p>“I know that. She told me that, too. But I’ve been looking for lodging for the whole day without finding anything, and so I made up my mind to turn to you and see whether I might get lucky.”</p><p>“You decided to see whether you might get lucky. You won’t get any luck from me. You’ve all come here to get lucky. Did you show up to look for a fiancé for yourself, too?”</p><p>“I want to meet my intended here. Please forgive me for bothering you. I’ll head off to the train station now and spend the night there.”</p><p>It began spitting rain, and the old woman muttered:</p><p>“They’re the bane of my existence, these girls. The bane. And it’s begun to rain. All right, I’ll set you up in the garden under the awning. There’s a hammock there and a bench, and some nails you can hang your clothes on. And you’ll pay me five hundred rubles a night.”</p><p>Lyuba was shocked. “Five hundred?”</p><p>“And how much did you think I’d charge? What, you think you’ve come to visit your relatives?”</p><p>“I agree to the five hundred. It’s just that I was hoping to spend about ten days here. But it doesn’t matter. I’ll stay five.</p><p> I agree to your conditions, Grandmother.”</p><p>“Then let’s go to where you’ll be sleeping. You’ll have a look at it, and you’ll pay me for each day in advance.”</p><p>Five days passed. And in the morning, Lyuba began packing her unsophisticated little things into her bag. The old woman came up to her, groaning and leaning on a stick.</p><p>“You’re all set to go, Dear? You’re off?”</p><p>“Yes, Grandmother. The five days have already passed.”</p><p>“Yes, they’ve passed. Do you already have your ticket?” the old woman asked and sat down on the bench.</p><p>“Yes, I bought a round trip ticket. It’s for five days from now, but maybe I’ll be able to exchange it for today or tomorrow.”</p><p>“You won’t be able to exchange it. Such great gudgeons of folks have descended here. Here’s what you do, Dear. Stay another five days with me, until the date on your ticket.”</p><p>“I can’t stay. I have nothing to pay you with.”</p><p>“If you have nothing to pay me with, well, then don’t pay. Just stay.”</p><p>“Thank you, Grandmother.”</p><p>“‘Thank you’ she says to me, only nothing will come of your staying.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“I’ve been watching you. That’s not the way people look for fiancés these days. Why do you get up with the sun, what for? All the fiancés are still asleep at dawn. And you go to bed early. That’s just the time the evening parties are getting going, and you’re getting ready for bed. All the fiancés are out and about ‘til midnight. You’re already asleep by ten. You dress like a nun and you don’t wear any makeup at all. That’s not how people look for fiancés these days.”</p><p>“My body, Grandmother – I’m preparing my body for my meeting with my intended. That’s why I try to keep to my regimen. I don’t wear makeup so that he’ll be able to recognize me.”</p><p>“Recognize you! You, Dear, are kooky in the head.”</p><p>“My mama tells me the same thing. But I can’t do a thing with myself. I often have dreams where he’s searching the whole world for me and just can’t find me.”</p><p>“Dreams? You have dreams? And have you had them here, too?”</p><p>“Yes, twice already. One time it was as if I was strolling around a big garden and he was also there, but we just couldn’t manage to get to each other. And it was as if I was hearing his voice. He kept calling me, ‘Where are you? Where are you?’”</p><p>“You heard it? His voice? You should probably go see a doctor, Dear. What do they have to drum it into your head for, about an intended? So you even hear voices in your sleep.”</p><p>“Sometimes I have a dream where it seems that he and I lived together sometime long, long ago. And we had children and grandchildren.”</p><p>“You lived together? Had children? Now, Dear, can you describe what he looks like, too?”</p><p>“Yes, I can. He’s half a head taller than I, brown-haired. And brown eyes. A kind smile, a small gap between his front teeth. A dignified gait.”</p><p>“A gap? And his gait? But what if you meet someone different?”</p><p>“I’ve met some before. At home Mama yells at me every time, says my dreams are keeping me a virgin.”</p><p>“Keeping you a virgin? Of course, they are. With dreams like that, you’ll never find a fiancé, never meet one. You know, Dear, here’s what I’m going to tell you. Tonight take my flowered shawl. Throw it around your shoulders and tie it in a kind of stylish way. And take a stroll along the shore later on in the evening.”</p><p>“Thank you for your concern, Grandmother. But I can’t throw a shawl over my blouse. I embroidered the design on my blouse myself. It came to me in a dream. And it’s as if some time long ago I strolled in the garden with my intended, wearing a blouse with that design.”</p><p>“With that design? You strolled? Well, Dear, I don’t know… May God be your judge. There’s come milk by the house on a table there, and I baked a flat cake. Have something to eat. I’m going to go see the neighbors.”</p><p>The old woman headed off, groaning. She mumbled under her breath, “I brought it all down on my gray head myself. Well, I’m a fool. I let her in, now I have to look after her. I’ll go and convince the neighbors’ son to court her. Yes, let him court her. Only he’s got black hair and she needs a brown-haired one with a gap. And the neighbors don’t have one like that.”</p><p>Starting in the morning, Lyuba wandered around the square. For lunch, she bought a little pastry filled with potato. As she was walking past the restaurant, a group of men was coming out. They were laughing and merrily talking back and forth in some foreign language. When they saw Lyuba, they started speaking to her in their language, but Lyuba couldn’t understand the foreign speech and walked on past. The men immediately began talking with some other girls.</p><p>And suddenly, without even looking back, she felt that someone had left the group of merry foreigners and was walking after her. She knew for certain that he was walking after her and no one else. She even counted his steps, without walking faster herself, and for some reason her heart was fluttering. She could sense his breath behind her, and suddenly the man walking behind her said, in a language she didn’t understand:</p><p>“Mit dir, die wunderschöne Göttin, durfte ich den ewigen Raum der Liebe schaffen.”</p><p>(“With you, o beautiful goddess, I could create a space of Love for all eternity.” – Translation from German.)</p><p>Lyuba couldn’t translate the words from the German. But for some reason, she whispered, “I am prepared to help you in the great co-creation,” and turned to face the foreigner.</p><p>Before her stood a young man, half a head taller than she. With brown hair and brown eyes, with a kind smile and a small gap between his front teeth. He extended his hand to Lyuba, and Lyuba, numb, not knowing what was happening, leaned against his chest. He embraced her trembling body as if he had known it forever.</p><p>The planets, invisible high above them, shook with delight. O, how many events had they had to create, how many threads of fate had they had to carry throughout the centuries! But it had worked! They had met and embraced!</p><p>Radomir and the beautiful Lyubomila. And it didn’t matter if they didn’t remember the past – their souls would create a beautiful future.</p><p>People on the beach were perplexed: why were that young man and that girl creating some kind of sketch or drawing on the sand? They were speaking different languages, but they seemed to understand each other. Now they’d discuss what they’d drawn, now argue a bit, or suddenly delightedly agree with each other about this or that.</p><p>And, caught up in their drawing, Lyubomila and Radomir also didn’t know that they were drawing, on the sand, the very plan for a marvelous homestead that they had created five thousand years earlier, before their wedding.</p><p>“The pond should be here, and it should be round,” Radomir announced in his language, digging out a little small hole in the sand.</p><p>“That’s not at all the way it should be,” Lyubomila whispered. “The pond should be oval.” And she corrected the circle, making it an oval.</p><p>“Yes, exactly,” Radomir agreed, as if recalling something. “An oval pond is better, somehow.”</p><p>And in the evening they went to the house where Lyubomila was staying. She asked the granny landlady’s permission for her companion to spend some time with her before she went to sleep. The landlady gave her permission.</p><p>Lyubomila fell asleep in the hammock, smiling. He sat on the bench, rocking the hammock ever so slightly and taking great care to drive away the various gnats with a branch. And he was singing something ever so softly.</p><p>And the old woman pulled the curtain aside the tiniest bit and watched them from the window of the house until the early morning light.</p><p>In the morning a pitcher of milk and flat breads, covered with a white cloth stood on the table in front of the house. There was also a note, written in an elderly hand. Lyubomila read it:</p><p>“I’m off on some errands. I’ll be gone for two days. Guard the house, and so as to guard it, live in the big room. There’s food in the refrigerator…”</p><p>Lyubomila and Radomir left together, but where did they head? The centuries will show us where their family line will rise up.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=08.225>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>25. Anastasia's Wedding</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>As I was taking my leave of Anastasia’s grandfather, I said to him:</p><p>“Please forgive me for the misunderstanding, back there in the taiga, when we were talking about the party’s goals and objectives. Now I get it: the stronger the families in a state are, then the more loving families will live in it and the more orderly the state will be.</p><p>“We have to bring back the sensible rites, our forbears’ rites. Only we have to adapt them to modern life somehow. Basically, I’m beginning to get that these aren’t even rites in the usual meaning of the word. This is a great science of life. And the sages were the greatest wise men and scholars.</p><p>“And you know what else I regret now? That I didn’t know anything about the rites back then, before I first met Anastasia. About how they can help you use the planets to benefit the family. I had no idea, and so Anastasia had to give birth to our son, and then our daughter, without being married.”</p><p>Grandfather looked at me in a kind of sly way, smiled beneath his gray whiskers and said:</p><p>“Well, now you’ve learned of them, and have you begun to wonder whether Anastasia gave birth to your son and daughter?”</p><p>“Well, it’s not that I’ve wondered about it a lot. But all the same, it wouldn’t be a bad thing for Anastasia and me to perform the necessary rite.”</p><p>“It’s good that you’re having regrets, Vladimir. That means you’re beginning to grasp the essence of existence and understand where human society is at now. But there’s no need for you to feel any regret regarding Anastasia. She got married before she spent that first night with you.”</p><p>For a while I couldn’t say a thing, then I forced the words out:</p><p>“Married to whom? I mean, I didn’t get married. I definitely remember that.”</p><p>“You</p><p> didn’t get married. We needed only her. It took my father three days to recover from her stunt. The kind of stunt that not a single wise man over the course of millions of year was able to think up. Well, to sum it up, she got married.”</p><p>“To whom?”</p><p>“To you, perhaps.”</p><p>“But listen, I didn’t get married. And why ‘perhaps’? What, don’t you know for sure?”</p><p>“What she did, Vladimir – no one can yet fathom it. It’s possible that she herself created the greatest rite and has given all women the opportunity to make their illegitimate children legitimate. It’s possible that she created something else in the heavens, as well. Perhaps only one sage would be able to fathom what she has created. I had better tell you everything in order.</p><p>“The first time you came with Anastasia to her glade and were getting ready to go to sleep in her dug-out, we had to come to our granddaughter’s glade.”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“She summoned us. My father and I sensed that and came together to the lake.</p><p>“Anastasia was standing on the shore, holding in her hands a wreath woven of flowers. She was all solemn somehow, dressed as a bride. When had come up to her, my father asked her sternly:</p><p>“‘Anastasia, what events permitted you to interrupt our evening thoughts?’</p><p>“‘Grandpa, there’s no one I could call except for you. You are the only ones capable of understanding me.’</p><p>“‘Go on, tell us,’ my father assented.</p><p>“‘I’m planning to get married and I’ve summoned you to serve as witnesses at my wedding.’</p><p>“‘You’re getting married,’ I asked Anastasia, clarifying. ‘Married? But wherever is your fiancé?’</p><p>“I should not have spoken when my father was leading the conversation. He cast me a stern glance. Speaking not to me, but to him, as the elder, she said:</p><p>“‘When a wedding is being performed, first they ask the young couple how the life all around them will be laid out. What kind of homestead they’ll create.’</p><p>“My father knew that full well, and he assented, not violating the rules. And right then, it seemed as if our granddaughter shut us down, as you say in your language, or charmed us, as if we were in a beautiful dream.</p><p>“Anastasia began speaking of her future neighbors. She can fashion holograms with her thought. You’re aware of that, Vladimir.”</p><p>“Yes, I’m aware.”</p><p>“But this time she moved more quickly than usual, from picture to picture of the earth’s future, there above the lake’s smooth surface. Her pictures were extraordinarily vivid.</p><p>“Here, people were walking along flowering avenues, smiling in a dignified manner, self-confident. There, children resembling angels were running through a meadow toward a riverlet. Then suddenly we saw our planet’s reflection in the beautiful lake, as if seen from high above.</p><p>“And there were a great many pictures and marvelous episodes and extraordinarily beautiful landscapes.</p><p>“And suddenly, one person rose above the earth, as if out of the fog. And everything else suddenly disappeared. This person was standing alone in the center of the lake and looking at us. Before long another man approached him from the right, and then an extraordinarily beautiful girl, then a second, and a third. Then two little boys walked up to them – twins, hand in hand. A great multitude of people were standing there, all slim, all tall. They were regarding us with a kind smile, and a pleasant warmth spread through our bodies from it. At that moment we heard our granddaughter’s voice:</p><p>“‘Grandpas, look: your great-grandsons have thought of you, with warm smiles on their lips. Look, Grandpa Moses, there’s a little tot standing off to the side. He resembles you, and his gaze shines with your soul.’</p><p>“When all the holograms had vanished, but while we still remained under the influence of the extraordinary, Anastasia suddenly uttered these words:</p><p>“‘What do you think, who can crown me in marriage?’</p><p>“And my father, sensing no trickery, asked, just as the rite of marriage demands:</p><p>“‘Maiden, who can crown you in marriage?’</p><p>“And she replied, “I crown myself in marriage before you, before the heavens, and before my own fate.’ And she herself placed the crown on her head.</p><p>“‘But where is your crown-bearing chosen one?’ inquired my father.</p><p>“‘He is preparing for sleep. But when he is awake, he is sleeping, too. He knows nothing of the rites. We will need to ask him later on, in some years.’</p><p>“‘You’ve violated the rules, Anastasia,’ my father said sternly. ‘The science of the ancient sages. Two people must take part in the rite. People can get married only together. The rite of marriage has not taken place.’</p><p>“‘Grandpa, believe me, it has taken place. I am now married before the heavens. Two people must indeed take part in the rite. But after all, first one is always asked of the desire to be wed, and then the other.</p><p>“‘I was asked, and I gave my answer. Let my chosen on ponder as many years as he wishes. No one has specified how much time must pass between the questions. A minute or ten years. But even if the answer is negative, then I shall remain married before myself. And I shall not violate the time-honored vow.’</p><p>“My father wanted to say something more, and he even began to speak, but thunder crashed in the sky, drowning out all his words. And my father turned and walked off, in no particular direction. That is what he would do when he was agitated. I could hardly keep up with him, and I heard him quickly saying, as if he was talking to himself:</p><p>“‘She’s persistent and clever and smart. You can’t make objections to her right away. It’s as if the heavens are always indulging her. She alters the way the planets interact. What, now women can give themselves in marriage and bear legitimate children all on their own? I have to make sense of what Anastasia has created, but first I have to bring everything back in accord with the former laws of existence. They’ve existed for centuries for a reason, after all. And in order to bring them back into accord, I need to have a weighty objection. But I wasn’t able to do that. She’s clever and smart, but I… Ah! Now I’ve found a way to object and nullify the rite.’</p><p>“My father turned sharply around and headed for the lake. When we made our way close to the lake, but hadn’t yet come out of the bushes, we saw a barely noticeable and unusual light above the lake. And the stars were reflected on the water. And they were falling, as if there had been a meteor shower. And our granddaughter was sitting alone on a fallen pine tree in her flower wreath and looking in the direction of the dug-out where you lay sleeping. And she was softly singing.</p><p>“My father held off coming out of the bushes. He listened to her singing and then said:</p><p>“‘She is married.’ And he banged his staff against the ground. ‘No one has the power to nullify her wedding. There are no powers equal to those and,’ my father quietly added, “whether our granddaughter has been crowned in marriage by the heavens or by her own self, it’s one and the same.’</p><p>“‘And what was Anastasia singing? What song?’</p><p>“‘This one:</p><p>I’ve crowned myself in marriage all on my own –</p><p>And now I am your woman.</p><p>And you are my only man.</p><p>Our dreams will come to life.</p><p>On the blue planet Earth,</p><p>Our son will be happy,</p><p>And our daughter lovely and smart.</p><p>They will bring much good to people.</p><p>I’ve been married to you by the heavens.</p><p>I am for all time your woman.</p><p>On a far away star, a large star,</p><p>Our grandchildren will abide.’”</p><p class=tbc>To be continued…</p></div>

<div class=chapter>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>Anasta </h2>************************ ************************ ************************
</br></div></p><p> </p><p>It was the year 2010 according to the Gregorian calendar. On the planet Earth, the first humans were awakening from a ten 
thousand-year sleep. What lay ahead of them was to see what had happened to the Earth while they slept, to understand the reasons for it, to engrave a record of what had 
happened into their memory as an anti-virus, so that nothing like this would ever happen again.</p><p>They engraved the many car accidents and wars. They engraved the stench in the 
air of the cities and the extensive pollution of the water. They engraved the numerous illnesses that had befallen humans’ physical bodies while humanity was in this sleep 
state. They engraved…</p><p>But for the moment, they were unable to formulate the causes. But they will be able to. Of course they’ll be able to! They’ll return to the earth its 
primordial nature.</p><p>A small child is walking through a glade in the heart of the vibrant Siberian taiga, smiling. Nothing frightens him, no one attacks him. On the contrary, 
the beasts are ready to rush to his aid at the first sign of trouble. The small person walks like a royal successor walking through his kingdom. He finds it interesting to 
observe the lives of the bugs, the squirrels and the birds. To study flower blossoms and see how the blades of grass and the berries taste. He’ll get a bit older, and then 
he’ll perfect this beautiful world.</p><p>And where is your child at this moment in time? What kind of air is he breathing? What kind of water is he drinking? How will he occupy 
himself when he grows up?</p><p>But first things first.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1001>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>1. The Beginning</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div></p><p> </p><p>I decided to start this book by reminding the reader of the events that took place in Siberia more than fifteen years ago, so 
as to make the book easier to grasp for people who haven’t read the earlier books in the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series. I’ll try to introduce some additional information 
about my first meeting with the unusual Siberian hermit Anastasia.</p><p>Anastasia lives in the heart of the Siberian taiga, in the same spot where her parents and her ancestors 
once lived. The distance from the spot where she lives to the nearest god-forsaken Siberian village is about twenty-five to twenty-seven kilometers. There are no roads and 
not even any paths. You’d have a very difficult time managing a trip like that without a guide. The actual glade where she lives doesn’t differ much from all the other taiga 
glades. Except in that it looks somewhat cared for, and in the number of flowers. There are no structures in Anastasia’s glade, no fire pits. But it’s precisely this spot 
that Anastasia considers her family space.</p><p>The first time I met Anastasia, in 1994, she was twenty-six years old.</p><p>The Siberian woman Anastasia is a very beautiful woman, even 
extraordinarily beautiful. The words “extraordinarily beautiful” are not an exaggeration. Imagine a young woman, a bit more than a hundred seventy centimeters tall, with a 
good figure – not waiflike, like contemporary models – but genuinely well built, and lithe, as if she were a gymnast. She has regular facial features, gray-blue eyes, and 
hair the color of golden wheat spikes that cascades to her waist.</p><p>Perhaps you could see a woman anywhere who looks like her – on the outside. But I don’t think you’d ever come 
across the other, special qualities deep inside her that make the taiga-dwelling Anastasia extraordinarily beautiful. Everything about her external appearance speaks of ideal 
health – it comes through in the fluidity and lightness of her gestures, in the springy way she walks, as if she were flying. You get the impression that her body contains 
within it some kind of other-worldly energy, whose abundance warms the surrounding space with invisible rays.</p><p>Your body warms up slightly when Anastasia looks at you, and by 
squinting at you with some kind of special gaze, she can heat up your body to such an extent at a distance, that your whole body begins to sweat, especially around the feet. 
Toxins leave the body, and afterwards, you feel significantly better.</p><p>In general, I surmise that Anastasia’s knowledge of the properties of the taiga plants and some kind of 
internal energy enable her to cure a person of absolutely any illness. At least, she cured my ulcer with her gaze in the course of a few minutes. However, she categorically 
refused to do any subsequent healing.</p><p>“Illness is a serious conversation between God and man,” says Anastasia. “Through this pain, which is both yours and His at the same 
time, He’s letting you know that you’re living in some unacceptable way. Change the way you live, and the pain will pass, the illness will recede.”</p><p>Anastasia has one 
extraordinary ability: when she’s telling a story about something, pictures of the events she’s narrating arise in the listener’s consciousness, or in actual space. And the 
images she shows are much more picture-perfect than any modern television picture. They’re three-dimensional, complete with the smells and sounds of the time she’s 
describing.</p><p>It’s quite possible that at one time many people possessed these capabilities. If you bear in mind that in our technocratic time, man hasn’t invented anything that 
wouldn’t have existed in nature, then it’s possible that something perfectly analogous to our modern television and telephone also existed in early human civilization.</p><p>Anastasia has shown me pictures from the lives of people of a variety of periods, starting from the very creation of the world. Pretty much all of the events she shows are 
connected with her ancestors.</p><p>If you were to try to characterize Anastasia’s capabilities in one phrase, here’s what you could say: the taiga-dweller Anastasia preserves the 
experiences and emotions of the members of her extended family – starting with the creation of the very first human – in her genetic memory, and she is able to call them up 
at will.</p><p>She can also model pictures from the lives of people in the future.</p><p>Anastasia’s life in the Siberian taiga differs significantly from the lives of people in modern 
cities. So that you’ll be able to understand the conditions in which she lives out her life, I have to say a few words about what the Siberian taiga is. It’s Russia’s largest 
expanse of open land, ancient and snow-covered. In European Russia, it extends for 800 kilometers, while in Western and Eastern Siberia, it stretches out for 2150 kilometers. 
As you can see, this is an impressive land mass. Today the taiga is considered the Earth’s lungs, and rightly so – it produces the majority of free oxygen.</p><p>You have to bear in 
mind that the taiga zones began forming even before the onset of the glaciers. So, by studying life in today’s taiga zone, we can learn about life on the planet Earth before 
the Ice Age.</p><p>Remains of a well-preserved baby mammoth, now kept in the Zoological Museum in Saint Petersburg, were discovered in the permafrost.</p><p>It’s hard for us to get a good 
idea of the animal world in taiga zones before the Ice Age. In today’s taiga, lynxes, wolverines, chipmunks, sables, squirrels, bears, foxes and wolves are numerous and 
widespread. The ungulates you’ll encounter include noble and northern deer, elk and roe deer. There are numerous rodents: shrews and mice.</p><p>Among birds, woodgrouse, hazel-
grouse, nutcrackers and crossbills are ubiquitous.</p><p>During the winter, the great majority of animals settle into anabiosis or hibernation. This state of living organisms has 
been little studied by scientists and is generating greater and greater interest among those who study outer space.</p><p>As far as the plant world is concerned, various types of 
bushes grow in the taiga: juniper, honeysuckle, currant and willow, and others. You find bilberries, cowberries, cranberry and cloudberries, all with marvelous vitamin 
content. Among grasses suitable for consumption, sour grass, wintergreen and ferns predominate.</p><p>You’ll find majestic trees reaching forty meters in height: spruce, fir, larch, 
pine and a tree with unique qualities – the cedar, which scientists sometimes call cedar pine. I’ll say right off that, in my opinion, they really shouldn’t call it that at 
all. But what can you do? Let science focus on the pine they mistakenly call a cedar – I’m going to talk about the incomparable Siberian cedar. Why is it incomparable? 
Because the cedar gives unique fruits – cedar nuts – and deserves its own, separate name. The quality of the fruit of the Siberian cedar, these cedar nuts, greatly surpasses 
that of the nuts of cedars in other climate zones on the planet. Way back in 1792, the academic Pallas wrote about this in a letter to the Russian Empress Catherine the 
Great.</p><p>Cedar wood possesses special phytoncidal properties even once it’s been cut, so a moth will never take up residence in a closet made of cedar.</p><p>And the Old Testament’s 
King Solomon, who also seems to have known of cedar’s mysterious properties, built a temple out of it, having given away several entire cities of his kingdom in exchange for 
certain specially chosen cedars.</p><p>But the priests were unable to perform services in the temple because a cloud formed inside it. (3rd Kings, 8:11.)</p><p>After having pored over a 
multitude of sources that talk about the Siberian cedar, I’m inclined to suggest (and not without basis) that the cedar is a representative of the Pre-Ice Age plant world, 
and that it may be an envoy to us from a different, more developed civilization (in the biological sense.)</p><p>How was it able to survive the planetary catastrophe and come to 
life anew in our world?</p><p>Cedar seeds can survive frost and are able to hold out for an extended period of time, so that they can come up during more favorable climatic 
conditions and adapt to a new environment. This adaptation continues up to the present day.</p><p>What is so unique about the fruit of the cedar? Why is it that today we can state 
with certainty that they are the most ecologically pure and healing food product of our time?</p><p>The cedar nut kernel contains the entire necessary complex of vitamins. 
Scientists from the university in Tomsk who have studied the properties of cedar oil added it to the diet of people who had served as responders to the accident at the 
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and who were suffering from radiation poisoning. The results of the experiment showed that the test subjects’ immunity began to increase.</p><p>There 
are no contraindications for the use of cedar oil – even pregnant women and nursing mothers can use it.</p><p>There’s one other mysterious fact about the cedar nut kernel. During 
periods when cedars do not bear fruit, the females of certain fur-bearing animals don’t allow males to come near them and don’t conceive. It’s still unclear how the cedars 
let the animals know that they won’t bear fruit in a given year. After all, the animals mate in the spring, but cedar fruits ripen only in very late fall, and it’s very 
difficult to tell, just by looking at a cedar tree, that it’s not going to bear fruit.</p><p>There are a great many other plants in the taiga for the entire taiga animal world to 
feed on. Similar taiga-dwelling animals in Russia’s central zone get along entirely without cedar nuts. So why do females who have fed on cedar nuts consider it impossible to 
conceive and bear young without this food?</p><p>It’s been noted that the fur of taiga-dwelling animals, particularly those from regions where cedars grow, is of much higher quality 
than the fur of all other animals. No matter how scientists and specialists fine tune the diet of the animals they’re raising on fur farms, they can’t manage to achieve fur 
of anywhere near the same quality. The fur of the Siberian sable from the regions where cedars grow has always been the highest quality fur in the world.</p><p>It’s well known that 
the condition of fur-bearing animals’ fur reflects the condition of their organism as a whole. So, if their condition improves when they consume cedar nut kernels, then the 
same should be true for humans, especially pregnant women. Our women might not be getting enough high-quality food products to enable them to bear healthy fetuses, and this 
situation can’t help but degrade society.</p><p>The fruit of the Siberian cedar disproves scientists’ opinion that agriculture is the great achievement of humans, evidence of their 
development. I think that agriculture came into being because human civilization lost its knowledge of nature and because people’s way of life changed. As a result, man began 
sweating in the fields to get his daily bread. You can draw your own conclusions.</p><p>Let’s image that there are two fruit-bearing cedar trees growing on a parcel of land where a 
family of three people lives. You can be absolutely certain that the family that owns that parcel of land where the two cedars grow will never go hungry, even in the years 
with the worst harvests. And it isn’t just that they won’t go hungry, won’t live from hand to mouth – they will feed on the best, most refined food there is.</p><p>One cedar alone 
is capable of producing – in one year – up to a ton of cedar nut that can be used as food, once they’re shelled. But that’s not all, not by any means. You can extract cedar 
milk from the kernel of the cedar nut, which is not only suitable for human consumption, but which you can also successfully use to feed infants. You can get world-class 
cedar oil from the kernels, which you can add to salads and other dishes and also use medicinally.</p><p>After you express the oil from the cedar nut kernels, you’re left with an 
oil-cake, which you can use to make excellent baked goods – bread, cookies, pastries, or crepes.</p><p>The cedar also gives us a sap that’s recognized by official and folk medicine 
alike as a medicinal and prophylactic substance.</p><p>The Siberian cedar doesn’t require any care at all by humans – you don’t need to fertilize or till around it. You don’t even 
need to plant it. Its seeds are planted in the earth by a little bird called the Eurasian nutcracker.</p><p>It starts to become clear why it is that our ancient ancestors knew 
nothing about agriculture. It’s just because they knew much, much more.</p><p>Maybe someone will say, well, the cedar bears fruit only once in two years, and if the barren year 
comes along in the same year as a bad harvest, then how can the cedar remedy the situation? I’ll tell you. It’s true that cedars bear fruit once every two years, sometimes 
even less frequently, but its unique nuts can last from nine to eleven years if you don’t remove them from the cone.</p><p>Of course, nothing is quite this simple today in our real 
life. The cedar has a hard time taking root near cities. It can’t tolerate ecologically polluted zones. But there are also encouraging outcomes. Many sources indicate that 
the cedar responds to human emotions, that it can take in energy from humans and, having increased it, give it back. I had the chance to convince myself of this personally.</p><p>Seven years ago, twenty-five taiga cedar seedlings were sent to me. Together with the residents of the five-story building where my apartment is located, I planted these 
seedlings in the little wooded area bordering the building. I planted three of them along the edge of the plot of my country house. Before long, somebody dug up the cedars 
we’d planted in the wooded area. I wasn’t too terribly upset by this – I figured that if somebody dug them up, that meant people knew about their properties and would most 
likely plant them somewhere else and take good care of them. But one seedling still remained there. It had been planted near the brick wall of the garages located in front of 
the building. The soil there was so, so far from fertile. For the most part, it was construction refuse covered over with a thin layer of fertile dirt. Nonetheless, the cedar 
took root and is still growing today. As far as its rate of growth and how smooth its trunk is, it’s quite different from the cedars I planted at my country house. And it’s 
about twice as tall. I got to thinking about why that would be, and I began to notice that when the people in the city come out onto their balconies, they often look at the 
cedar, and sometimes they remark, “What a beautiful tree we have.” And I, too, when I walk or drive by, happily admire it. In this way, the cedar growing by the garages 
receives human attention and strives to be worthy of it.</p><p>Now, especially since the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series of books started coming out, there are many companies that 
put out cedar products, including cedar oil.</p><p>I also asked my daughter and her husband to set up cedar oil production. I told them about the ancient technique I’d learned of 
from Anastasia.</p><p>Polina’s husband Sergei made every possible effort to work in accord with both ancient techniques and today’s requirements for producing food products. We 
arranged for the production to take place at a medications factory under the control of experienced specialists. The expression was carried out using the cold pressing 
method, which is supposed to preserve the greatest amount of the oil’s beneficial substances, and using wooden blocks. It was necessary to do this, because the cedar nut 
kernel and oil contain the entire periodic table, and certain elements can oxidize if they come in contact with metal. In addition, only glass containers were used during 
bottling. The oil we ended up with may also have been of better quality than if we’d produced it using other methods, such as hot pressing. However, it differed from the 
cedar oil I’d tried in the taiga. I got the impression that it contained less life force than the taiga cedar oil.</p><p>I won’t go into detail about our extensive attempts to find 
the reason for the differences. I’ll start by saying that we saw a change in quality as soon as we moved the whole production process – from nut storage up to the pressing of 
the oil and its packaging – to a village out in the taiga a hundred and twenty kilometers outside the city.</p><p>It turned out that you just can’t produce a high quality oil in an 
urban setting, even at a medications factory. At every stage of production, the kernel and oil come into contact with the air, and big city air is very different from air in 
the taiga, which is full of phytoncides.</p><p>As a result of moving production, the products of this small company, which was perhaps not very technically well-equipped according 
to today’s standards, were of higher quality than those produced by all other companies, not only in our country, I think, but in the world. I’m happy to have played even a 
small role in the appearance of this unique product – cedar oil. I think that this taiga company is really the only one that produces actual cedar oil, because the others 
produce the oil of the “cedar pine.”</p><p>A great many products in the world are marketed as “ecologically pure.” But I immediately ask myself where these products are from? Where 
were they grown? Can you really call any product ecologically pure at all if its raw materials are grown and produced in an area surrounded by highways or big and small 
cities? I don’t think any product produced in areas like that can be ecologically pure, even if no toxic chemicals, pesticides or fertilizers are used to grow it.</p><p>The cedar 
grows deep in the Siberian taiga, hundreds and thousands of kilometers from large cities. There are no highways there, and you can only ship this unique product out by river. 
Of course, our civilization’s filth can also end up there, but everything in the world is relative, and compared to giant cities, the air and water in the taiga really are 
immeasurably cleaner, and no one is pouring any poisons into the ground.</p><p>And so, I think that there is no more pure, beneficial or healing product in the world than the cedar 
nut kernel and the products made from it.</p><p>In telling about the Siberian taiga, I’ve given special attention to the cedar. But in the taiga region there are also many other 
food products that are of much higher quality than those we’re already aware of. For example, cranberries, raspberries, cloudberries, currants and mushrooms. And to answer 
the question, what does Anastasia eat out there in the taiga, I can tell you that she eats world class ecologically pure food of a type that you can’t possibly buy, not even 
for a million dollars.</p><p>Back in my first book I described how Anastasia lives out in the taiga and how astonished I was by her way of life. Now that so many years have passed 
since we first met, in thinking about her, I’ve come to the conclusion that the way people live in today’s giant cities looks unnatural and absurd if you juxtapose it with 
Anastasia’s life out in nature.</p><p>At first glance it seems extraordinary, the way the wild animals bring food to Anastasia when she gives them a certain signal. But even a 
hunting dog today will bring its prey to its master. And a falcon released to hunt also turns its prey over to its master. Goats and cows in a village farmyard are happy to 
feed their owners by giving them milk.</p><p>The wild animals inhabiting the area around the glade where Anastasia lives mark their territory, and within this territory they 
consider a person something like a pack leader. I think that over the generations, they were trained by Anastasia’s forbears, and then they themselves trained their 
offspring.</p><p>Anastasia actually eats very little. She never makes a fetish out of food.</p><p>Many people have been asking recently about how Anastasia makes it through the severe 
Siberian winter – when the temperature reaches thirty-five to forty degrees below zero – if she doesn’t have any warm clothing or a heated dwelling. I’ll start by saying that 
if the air temperature out in the open gets down to minus thirty, it’s always significantly warmer in the taiga, and there can be up to a ten-degree difference in 
temperature.</p><p>Anastasia has dug-outs at various locations in the taiga. The main one, where I myself have had occasion to pass the night more than once, consists of a spot 
hollowed out in the ground, about two and a half meters long, two meters wide and also about two meters high. The entrance to the dug-out is narrow, about sixty centimeters 
wide and a meter and a half high. The entrance is covered over with cedar branches. The walls and ceiling of the taiga bedroom are woven of vines with bunches of dried 
grasses and taiga flowers stuffed into them. The floor has been carpeted with dried hay.</p><p>It’s very comfortable sleeping in that kind of bedroom in the summer. No sounds 
penetrate it, to say nothing of all those radio and electrical emissions that a person living in a multi-story building is subjected to.</p><p>In late fall, Anastasia fills the 
entire area of her bedroom with dry hay and enters into an extended sleep similar to the state scientists call anabiosis.</p><p>Anabiosis as modern science explains it, is a state 
in which all of a living being’s vital processes, including metabolism, slow down to such an extent that there are no visible signs of life.</p><p>Scientists have been focusing on 
this unique biological phenomenon as they develop plans for extended space travel. What primarily attracts them is the fact that creatures in an anabiotic or hibernation 
state use much less oxygen and do not need food. It’s been proven that their resistance to negative environmental factors increases. So, for example, it’s been shown that 
infectious diseases don’t develop in such animals, even when they’re artificially infected, and that many poisons which would be fatal for their organism under normal 
circumstances are entirely harmless to them when they are hibernating or in an anabiotic state. It’s even been proven that if you subject such animals to a fatal does of 
ionizing radiation, they will still survive, since their metabolism has greatly decelerated, and that once they awaken, their vital functions resume entirely normally.</p><p>But 
here’s what’s interesting. If a person – who is a thinking being – falls into a deep sleep in the winter, then what happens to his Soul during this period? I haven’t come 
across any hypotheses at all about this in scientific writings. But it is an extremely interesting question.</p><p>One day I, too, had occasion to partially experience the unusual 
state of anabiosis for myself. This happened when I was in the taiga in late fall. Where Anastasia lives, the days at that time of year are very short. When it began to get 
dark, Anastasia suggested I take a rest. I immediately agreed. The accumulated fatigue of city life and my taxing journey through the taiga were already driving me toward 
sleep.</p><p>This time the dug-out was full of more hay than usual. Since I knew you don’t get cold sleeping in hay even when it’s below zero, I stripped down to my underwear and 
lay down, putting my jacket beneath my head.</p><p>“It’s already time for you to be waking up, Vladimir,” Anastasia said, waking me.</p><p>I felt her massaging my right hand, and I looked 
toward the entrance of the dug-out. Its opening was barely visible. That meant the sun hadn’t yet come up.</p><p>“Why do I need to wake up? The dawn is just breaking.”</p><p>“It’s the 
third dawn since you went to sleep that’s breaking, Vladimir. Should you not wake up, your sleep might continue for several months and even years. Your Soul, since it won’t 
need to worry about keeping your body safe, will want to have a rest and wander around other worlds in the Universe. No one would be able to bring it back until it decides on 
its own that it wants to come back.”</p><p>“So that means it wasn’t with me while I was sleeping?”</p><p>“It was with you Vladimir, right alongside you. It was waiting for your sleep to 
become more even, and deeper, and then it would have been able to take its leave. But I decided to wake you.”</p><p>“But why doesn’t your Soul leave when you fall into a deep 
sleep?”</p><p>“My Soul leave, too, but it always comes back right on time. After all, I don’t torment it.”</p><p>“What do you mean? You mean I torment my soul?”</p><p>“Vladimir, every person who 
falls prey to harmful habits and thought patterns, and who consumes harmful food, brings torment first and foremost to his Soul.”</p><p>“What importance does food have for the Soul? 
What, does it also consume the food a person eats?”</p><p>“The Soul doesn’t feed on material food, Vladimir, but it is able to see, hear and actualize itself only through your body. 
If the body is unhealthy, if, for example, a person is drunk and his body is helpless, then the Soul, as if it were bound, has no way of manifesting and actualizing itself. 
It can only feel, only weep over the helpless body that has been destroyed by the harmful drink. It can only attempt to warm damaged organ of the body, and it will expend a 
colossal amount of energy as it does so. When the Soul’s energy is exhausted, it becomes powerless and leaves the human body. The body dies.”</p><p>“Yes, Anastasia. What you’ve said 
about the Soul is interesting and, it seems, accurate. Because there’s a folk saying: when a person dies, they say that he ‘gave up his Soul to God.’ What we get in your 
interpretation is ‘the Soul ran out of strength.’ Hmm, I wonder – does my Soul still have strength left?”</p><p>“Since it came back, that means your Soul still has strength, 
Vladimir. But please, try not to torment it.”</p><p>“I will try. But wait, doesn’t a person’s Soul get a rest when he’s sleeping?”</p><p>“The Soul is energy, Vladimir. A living energetic 
complex. Energy doesn’t need rest.”</p><p>“But what do you think, Anastasia, where does the Soul go off to during sleep?”</p><p>“It can go off to other dimensions, soar among the planets 
of the Universe. And if the person wishes it to do so, it can gather information he needs. For example, if the person wants to learn something about the past or future, he 
can ask his Soul as he falls asleep to visit the time and place that interests him, and the Soul will fulfill his wish. But if the person sleeps an ordinary sleep that isn’t 
sufficiently peaceful, and if the environment is not ideal, then the Soul can’t go off anywhere. It has to guard his body.”</p><p>“From whom?”</p><p>“From all manner of hostile influences. 
You sleep in your apartment, Vladimir, and its walls are filled to bursting with electrical wires, and the wires give off radiation that adversely affects people. Sounds of 
the artificial world force their way in through the glass. The air in the apartment is not entirely healthy to breathe. Your Soul cannot leave you alone. It has to be able to 
wake you in the case of a critical situation.”</p><p>“I get it, Anastasia. This dug-out I slept in is actually a great deal more comfortable than the most elegant bedrooms in 
today’s hotels and apartments. It’s like some kind of hypobaric chamber. The air here is ideal, and there are no harmful rays and noise, and the temperature is stable. And so 
I sleep much better in it than I do in my apartment. I understand that, and I’ve experienced it for myself. But I don’t get why it is, when you fall asleep for a long time, 
that it doesn’t bother your Soul that your body is resting in a dug-out where the entrance isn’t even shut up. And if there’s some danger – say there are some intruders – 
there won’t be anybody to wake it up.”</p><p>“Vladimir, any time anyone makes the slightest attempt to approach the glade we’re in, no matter what their intentions, the entire space 
within a radius of three kilometers is put on its guard. The animals, birds and plants begin sounding the alarm. Those who are approaching will be gripped by terror, and if 
they succeed in overcoming it and aren’t thrown off course, then the space – by means of the animals – will wake the body and call the Soul back.”</p><p>“What about in the winter, 
when everything’s asleep?”</p><p>“Not everything is asleep in the winter. Besides, in the winter, it is easier for those who are awake to keep watch over what goes on.”</p><p>I don’t 
understand everything Anastasia said about the Soul during her winter sleep period, but I have had occasion to see for myself the way the wild animals and birds bring 
Anastasia troubling or happy news.</p><p>Now that I’m familiar with the way Anastasia thinks of sleep, I can draw the following conclusion:</p><p>Modern man and mankind as a whole don’t 
have any opportunity to get enough good sleep. Besides the fact that modern bedrooms can’t measure up to the natural one, we have to add one more factor that’s also of some 
importance: modern man is continually caught up in a whirlwind of everyday worldly concerns, and he often keeps on thinking about them as he falls asleep. And if that’s the 
case, then the question arises of how man is using the energy of his Soul – his Soul, which is capable of learning about other worlds when a person is sleeping and bringing 
him information about them when he wakes. Perhaps we need to construct our bedrooms so that no random sounds will penetrate it and so there are no wires and telephones in it. 
It’s possible for us to achieve this. It’s more complicated to manage the necessary air quality.</p><p>And so, Anastasia, the hermit of the Siberian taiga, has become the heroine of 
the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series of books. She has borne me a son and a daughter. She now lives in the taiga, in my heart, and in the image of the heroine of my books.</p><p>I 
don’t think I’ve been able to do this amazing woman’s beauty, her intelligence and her extraordinary capabilities justice in my descriptions. Really, it’s probably not even 
possible to do this using ordinary language.</p><p>Even now, I only sometimes see Anastasia as someone who is close to me, as a loved one. More often I see her as unattainable and 
mysterious, as someone who possesses an inexplicable strength of spirit that she can use to create the future.</p><p>Her characterization of our modern day reality and her story – 
or more precisely, the image she has created of the beautiful future of Russia and of the whole earth – have given birth to a beautiful phenomenon in society. Without waiting 
for decrees to be handed down from on high, or for government financing, tens of thousands of people have independently set about turning this image created by Anastasia into 
actual reality. You can understand the main idea for building our future country by reading the books in order. But if I were to try to briefly – not in its entirety –present 
the idea that is helping these positive transformations take place, I could characterize it using the following words.</p><p>Anastasia thinks that every family should have its own 
plot of land that’s no less than one hectare in size. The family needs to transform this plot, which the taiga hermit calls a family homestead, into a heavenly living oasis 
that can provide for all of man’s material needs. The external appearance of the person’s living creation and the way the creator himself lives on it are indicators of the 
person’s spiritual makeup. She considers it unacceptable to bury family members in a cemetery. They must be buried only on the family homesteads. Then the souls of relatives 
who have passed on won’t suffer because their bodies seem to have been tossed into some deep hole in a cemetery, far away from their loved ones. People who are buried on the 
family homestead will – with their spirit – help and protect those living on it.</p><p>Cemeteries analogous to our modern ones did exist back in antiquity, too, but they were 
intended for animals that dropped dead from disease, criminals with no family, and warriors who died in a foreign land.</p><p>Anastasia has told us how to set up our own family 
homestead so that we can free ourselves from physical ailments with its help.</p><p>She has talked in relatively great detail about the ancient and very lovely rite of marriage that 
helped newlyweds – along with the power of their thought – create the design for their future family homestead, and about how at the moment of marriage, with the 
participation of the parents, relatives and friends, what they had conceived in thought would materialize in the space of several minutes. I think that this rite is one of 
the greatest discoveries of our millennium. After all, by using it, newlyweds even today can acquire a house, a garden and a family homestead right during their wedding.</p><p>Anastasia also asserts that for newlyweds who create their family homesteads in this way, love never fades, but actually grows stronger over the years. And she explains why 
this happens: “When a husband looks at his wife, he subconsciously associates her with his glorious homestead, too, and also with his child, who must also be born on the 
homestead.” And one can believe in this. After all, the very best place on earth for each person is always his small motherland. His child will always be the most beautiful 
and best of all children.</p><p>And Anastasia also asserts that if all people, or the majority of them, begin consciously creating their own family homesteads and turning them into 
heavenly oases, then the whole earth will be transformed. Natural disasters and wars will not occur on earth. Man’s inner spiritual world will change, and new knowledge and 
capabilities will open up to him. Man will be able to create beautiful worlds resembling the earthly world on other planets.</p><p>She considers today’s technocratic method of 
exploring space and other planets a dead end, harmful for the planet Earth and the people living on it. The sensible way to explore the planets is through 
psychoteleportation. But if people are to be able to do this, they first have to demonstrate their ability to develop the Earth and express their spirituality in their way of 
life, not in words.</p><p>Official critics might respond to the subjects of the books and to the taiga hermit’s statements in any of a number of ways, but their opinions aren’t 
really so very important. The people – the most important critics – have already expressed their approval in tens of thousands of letters and hundreds of thousands of emails. 
They’ve expressed it not only in words, but in concrete actions, too, and the hundreds of large and small settlements that have arisen and continue to arise throughout all of 
Russia are a confirmation of this.</p><p>Now, here’s where a riddle arises, one that’s as yet insoluble and cryptic: if a mass movement has been set in motion solely by the 
statements of a taiga hermit that have been introduced in books, then what kind of power lies behind her phrases? Perhaps they’re constructed in such a way that the letters 
combine into some kind of code. Perhaps, a certain rhythm of her phrases has significance.</p><p>Anastasia usually tries to adopt the speaking mannerisms of those she’s talking 
with, to use his lexicon and way of constructing phrases, but at certain moments she’ll suddenly being speaking in some different kind of language that’s emphatic and flowing 
and rhythmical. She pronounces each letter of the phrases she utters very precisely, and you clearly sense an extraordinary energy behind each sound. And then you remember 
what she’s said verbatim, as if there’s some recorder at work in your brain. And that’s not all. Living pictures appear before the listeners, and the subconscious grasps the 
meaning of what’s been said. By way of example, I’ll give you an excerpt from Anastasia’s retelling of a conversation between God and the first man, from the book “Co-
Creation”: “Where is the edge of the Universe? What will I do when I come to it? When I have filled everything with myself, when I create that which I have thought?” a man of 
the wellspring people asks God. And he receives this answer: “My son, The Universe is thought. A dream was born of the thought, and it is partially visible as matter. When 
you come to the edge of everything, a new beginning and continuation shall your thought discover. Out of nothing will arise the new, beautiful birth of you, and of the 
aspiration, reflecting in itself your Soul and your dream. My son, you are endless, you are eternal, your creating dreams are within you.”</p><p>There are several theories regarding 
Anastasia’s abilities. I’ll share mine with you, too.</p><p>Anastasia’s abilities, which seem extraordinary at first glance, were actually inherent in all or the majority of the 
wellspring people. The effect the taiga hermit’s statements have had on many people’s actions is due not to some mystical force, but rather to people’s very own ability to 
embrace them with their heart and Soul. You get the impression that some memory has been preserved in modern day people’s genes, or in their subconscious: a memory of the way 
individual families and human society as a whole lived, starting back in the time of the wellspring people, when Man still understood how to communicate directly with God.</p><p>This way of life – the wellspring people’s – is significantly more advanced than today’s. Maybe it’s from those times when people still knew what heaven was. But I don’t 
think these people’s actions were connected to any specific religion.</p><p>All the homesteads that readers of the books are building turn out differently from each other. The 
houses they put up don’t just differ in their external appearance. Some are two-story wooden houses, while others are one-story wattle and daub affairs. And the gardens, 
living fences and ponds are also constructed differently.</p><p>It’s common knowledge that religious ritual requires all its participants to strictly observe standardized ways of 
acting and speaking. But here, we clearly see each individual’s personal creativity in the way they realize this beautiful idea.</p><p>If people are thankful to Anastasia for 
anything, it’s probably for the fact that she has awakened within their Souls the aspirations of a human-creator.</p><p> <div class=chapter id=1002>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>2. The Little Taiga Dweller</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p>More than fifteen years have passed since I met 
Anastasia, the hermit of the Siberian taiga. And when I learned that she was going to bear my son, I took great pains to move Anastasia to the city of Novosibirsk, even going 
so far as to try to intervene physically. Back then, it seemed unacceptable to me for her to give birth in the taiga, and impossible to raise a child outside social 
institutions.</p><p>At first, Anastasia’s way of life in the taiga seemed strange to me, to put it mildly. But now the way people live in today’s giant cities seems even stranger.</p><p>And when she was pregnant with our daughter and stayed in the taiga, as she’d done before with our son, my soul was joyous and calm. My views of life had changed radically in 
the course of ten years.</p><p>Had Anastasia wanted to give birth somewhere other than the taiga – even if she’d been in the best maternity ward in the capital – I’d have fallen 
into depression and despair. And I’d probably have worried constantly about our child’s future if he’d ended up being raised and educated within today’s societal 
institutions.</p><p>I’d rethought my priorities and my views of life had changed.</p><p>Anastasia gave birth to our daughter in her family glade in the Siberian taiga. I wasn’t present for 
the birth, and there were no qualified doctors at her side, no modern medical equipment. But in my soul I was calm. I knew that she was giving birth in one of the most 
perfect maternity wards on earth – in her family space.</p><p>When Anastasia gave birth to our daughter, she asked what I would like to name the newborn. Without thinking, I 
answered – Anastasia. And it wasn’t because Anastasia had named our son Vladimir. It’s just that by the time our daughter was born, I’d come to see Anastasia as a wise, brave 
and very kind woman. Her name had become synonymous for me with these qualities, and I wanted our daughter to inherit them. I couldn’t imagine anyone other than Anastasia 
raising our daughter. Even though at many points her approach to childrearing looks like a total lack of a conscious approach to childrearing, that’s far from the case. For 
example, here’s what happened one time with our little daughter in the taiga.</p><p>This time when Anastasia met me, she was in a jolly mood, even playful, it seemed to me. She 
appeared suddenly when I was approaching the familiar glade where the three of them were now living. Wearing a light dress reminiscent of a Roman tunic, she stood on my path 
and smiled. I wondered where she’d gotten that dress. I stopped, delighting in the unusual vision.</p><p>“It’s really something,” I thought. “So much time has passed, and she’s 
given birth to two children, but she looks just as young and extraordinarily beautiful as before. Look at me – I’ve grown old and gray, but she doesn’t age a bit.”</p><p>I recalled 
how, waking up early in the morning, she’d take joy in the coming day and set off racing against the she-wolf, performing elaborate somersaults. Would she be able to do that 
now?</p><p>As if she’d heard my silent question, Anastasia performed a double somersault with almost no running start at all, and then there she was again, right next to me.</p><p>Her 
voice rang out. “Hello, Vladimir.”</p><p>I wasn’t able to answer right away. A captivating aroma and extraordinary warmth radiated from Anastasia’s body. I shyly touched her on the 
shoulder. For some reason I hesitated to embrace her. And I responded lamely:</p><p>“And hello to you, Anastasia.”</p><p>She snuggled up against me, hugged me and whispered:</p><p>“Our darling 
little daughter is such a smart and beautiful little thing.”</p><p>Then Anastasia walked ahead of me barefoot through the grass. She stepped, putting one foot in front of the other, 
the way a model does on a runway. This wasn’t the first time she’d done this, but every time she does it, her gait looks hilarious, and it raises my spirits.</p><p>As we usually 
did, we headed straight to the lake to bathe after my trip. I already knew the purpose of this swim wasn’t just so I could freshen up after traveling. The main point of it 
was to wash away all the smells that weren’t native to this taiga glade. To do this, once I’d taken my first dip, Anastasia helped me give myself a brisk rub down with a 
paste she’d made of various herbs. Rubbing me all over, she joked:</p><p>“You’re having less and less good food and your tummy’s a little distended.”</p><p>“It’s dysbacteriosis. That’s 
what the doctors say. Practically ninety percent of the population has it,” I replied.</p><p>Anastasia laughed. “Or maybe the whole problem is that the tummies don’t have enough 
will power? You yourself say that ten percent of the population doesn’t have this dysbacteriosis.”</p><p>I had to walk around for a while with my body and even my hair coated with 
this green paste and then dive back into the water and splash myself with water. After I came out of the water and my body had dried off a bit, Anastasia removed her tunic-
like dress and held it out to me.</p><p>“It would be good for you to put this shirt on now.”</p><p>Anastasia stood before me, her breasts exposed. They were a bit larger than they’d been 
before. A tiny drop of milk appeared on one nipple.</p><p>“You’re still nursing our daughter?” I asked.</p><p>“I’m supplementing with milk,” Anastasia answered brightly. She squeezed her 
breast with both hands and splashed me in the face with a stream of milk, then laughed and wiped the milk over my face.</p><p>“If you put this on and belt it, it will look like a 
shirt on you. I’ve been wearing this shirt continually since I gave birth to our daughter. Sometimes she would sleep wrapped in it. She’s grown accustomed to its smell and to 
the way it looks. If you do what I tell you to do, it will be easy for our little girl to get used to you.”</p><p>“But what will you wear now?”</p><p>“Well, I have two very similar ones, 
and I’ve alternated wearing them. The one I’m offering you – that one I wore more. And I’d often fasten my hair with a little braid made of grass. Now I’ll go braid one like 
it for you, too, and meanwhile you can go observe our little girl a bit.”</p><p>“Just observe her a bit? You mean I’m not allowed to touch her or have contact with her?”</p><p>“Of course 
you’re allowed, Vladimir. Even so, it’s better just to observe her at first. Even though she’s little, she already an independent being, so it’s better if you just observe 
her first, without pestering her. You can acquaint yourself with her habits and try to get a sense of her world.”</p><p>“I know that when our son was born, I just observed him at 
first, too. Tell me, Anastasia, how long before I can pick her up?”</p><p>“You will feel when the time is right. Your heart will let you know.”</p><p>It seemed to me that Anastasia wanted 
me to observe our little daughter on my own and try to figure something out, and that’s why she’d come up with some urgent tasks of her own. And I wasn’t against this way of 
doing things, either. I really did need to find some way to study how our child behaves, because to my daughter, I was just some “uncle” she didn’t know. And then this 
strange uncle suddenly goes and picks the child up for no reason at all and starts with his sloppy sentimentality, squeezing her and cooing to her to make himself happy. But 
maybe the child hates being cooed at, not just by strange uncles, but in general, no matter who’s doing it. I asked:</p><p>“Anastasia, so where is our daughter now? If you go off to 
do your braiding, you know, to braid the tie, how will I find her?”</p><p>“She’s somewhere around here, not far away,” Anastasia told me calmly. “Try to find her yourself. Let your 
heart tell you where she’s to be found.”</p><p>It seemed to me that I’d begun to understand a lot about life in the taiga glade. But each time something new would still amaze me.</p><p>How 
can you allow a child who hasn’t even turned two yet to walk or crawl wherever she wants through the taiga and not even keep an eye on her while she does? And this is the 
taiga, where there are no people. In the taiga, where there are a great many wild animals.</p><p>In the past I’d observed my newborn son and had seen him fall asleep against a she-
bear’s belly, while the she-bear lay motionless, waiting for him to get a good sleep. I saw how the wolves would guard the infant and how the nimble squirrels would play with 
him. It was clear to me that the beasts living here in the glade or nearby it were like pets. Within the territories they’d marked, they didn’t fight and didn’t attack each 
other. A dog that lives in the same household with a cat might not touch the cat or might even become friends with it, but he might still attack a cat from outside the 
family. So it makes sense that here, too, the animals don’t attack each other within their defined territory, and they certainly won’t attack the human’s offspring.</p><p>They 
revere the human living on their territory, so naturally they’ll protect the human child and consider it an honor to look after him. All the same, this kind of situation was 
a little unfamiliar. For example, what might happen if the child were to go outside the marked territory? Other wild animals wouldn’t treat him the way his own do. Basically, 
in spite of the logic of it all, some unfamiliar feelings arose in me.</p><p>“But what if I come across some wild animal while I’m looking for our daughter?” I asked Anastasia as 
she was walking off. “I’m still not used to them and they’re not used to me, either.”</p><p>“They won’t do anything bad to you, Vladimir – you’re wearing the shirt, after all. You 
can walk around with complete confidence and not torment yourself with fearful thoughts.” Anastasia ran off to her little earthen home.</p><p>After I came out into the glade and 
didn’t find anyone there, I set off through the forest surrounding the glade, since I figured our daughter might be close by. I decided that if I walked in circles, gradually 
increasing the diameter, then I’d be sure to catch sight of her.</p><p>And I saw her before I’d even completed my first loop. Little Anastasia was standing alone between some 
currant bushes. She was holding onto one of the branches and examining some bug and smiling. I hid behind another bush and began observing her.</p><p>The little girl was dressed in 
a short shirt-like dress, her hair bound with a tie woven from the strands of some kind of grass.</p><p>Once she’d satisfied her curiosity about what was going on on the branch, she 
set off barefoot across the grass in the direction of the glade. Then her foot must have caught on a branch or in the grass, and she fell down. The little girl fell flat on 
her face on the grass, but she didn’t cry. Without a word, she braced her little hands against the ground and sat up. Then she crawled a meter or two on hands and knees and 
then got to her feet once more and, stepping slowly, continued along her path.</p><p>Trying to remain unnoticed, I followed my daughter very cautiously. And suddenly, right before 
my very eyes, Nastenka1 disappeared. At first, shocked, I just stopped and stood stock still for a bit. Then I quickly ran up to the spot where she’d just been walking and 
began looking all around, but she was nowhere to be seen – not behind the tree near where she’d disappeared, and not behind the bush. The little girl couldn’t yet run fast 
enough to disappear from sight so swiftly.</p><p>I began circling around the tree near where she’d disappeared, increasing the diameter of the circle with each round, but I still 
couldn’t see her. I stood for some time, trying to decide what to do, then I ran to the little earthen house where I figured Anastasia would be.</p><p>She was sitting calmly at the 
entrance, braiding a headband out of grass strands, and quietly singing. Not far away, a silver fox was rubbing herself against the tree trunk like an affectionate cat.</p><p>“Anastasia, our daughter’s disappeared,” I blurted out. “I was walking a few meters behind her, not taking my eyes off her. Then suddenly she up and … it was like she 
dissolved into thin air. She’s nowhere to be found.”</p><p>Anastasia reacted with surprising calm – she didn’t even stop her braiding as she answered:</p><p>“Don’t worry, Vladimir. I think 
she’s probably in the old fox den now.”</p><p>“Who told you that?”</p><p>“Do you see the lazy way the fox is rubbing against the tree?”</p><p>“Yes, I see.”</p><p>“That’s her way of letting me know the 
child is in her den.”</p><p>“But maybe she’s trying to tell you something else?”</p><p>“If she was telling me about something bad, then she’d be showing her agitation. She’d run off a bit, 
then come running back and try to get me to follow her to help.”</p><p>“All the same, you can’t be a hundred percent certain where our daughter is, especially since there’s no den 
at all in the spot where she disappeared – I looked around everywhere.”</p><p>“All right, Vladimir, then let’s go and have a look together and see where our clever little one has 
hidden.”</p><p>When we arrived at the spot where the little girl had seemed to dissolve, Anastasia pushed side some grass, and I immediately glimpsed the den. Its entrance was 
partially collapsed, and a little hole had formed. I glanced inside it and saw Nastenka sleeping peacefully, curled up on the bottom.</p><p>“There! You see? She’s fallen asleep on 
the damp ground. And I don’t think she’ll be able to get out of there on her own.”</p><p>“The grass on the bottom is dry, Vladimir. And when our little daughter wakes up, she’ll be 
able to solve the problem of how to get out of her shelter all on her own.”</p><p>“How will she figure that out?”</p><p>“If you want, Vladimir, you just watch, and I’ll head back and 
finish what I was working on.”</p><p>I stayed put. After about thirty minutes, I heard a rustling sound in the hole. The little girl had awakened, but she was having a hard time 
scrambling out of the hollow on her own. But she wasn’t actually even trying very hard to do so. After making her first attempt and testing her own powers, she let out a 
sound, summoning someone: Yoohoo! Hey! Not a cry, but an actual summons. And right away, the vixen that had been hanging around Anastasia earlier appeared. First she stood at 
the edge of her former den; she looked in, sniffed, and then, turning her back to the den, lowered her tail into it. The vixen tensed her muscles and slowly pulled the little 
child who’d grabbed onto her tail out of the den. The little girl trailed along behind the fox for about half a meter. After that she let go of the tail, got up onto her 
hands and knees, and then stood up on her own two feet. Little Nastenka took a look around, smiled, as if recalling something, and then, stepping slowly, she set off, 
smiling, in the direction of the lake. I continued to follow her, unnoticed.</p><p>There were no wild animals around, and it seemed that no one in the taiga besides me was watching 
the little one. But a bit later on I realized I was wrong about that. It turned out that she and I were both being watched closely, and before long, I for the first time saw 
a conflict between my daughter and a wild animal in the taiga.</p><p>When Nastenka had made her way out from amongst the raspberry bushes, she stood where she was for some time and 
gazed at the mirror-like surface of the lake. Then she took off her short little shirt and, stepping carefully with her bare feet, headed toward the lake. She was about five 
to six meters from the water when a tough-looking she-wolf suddenly sprang out of the bushes and, with several powerful leaps, put herself between the shore of the lake and 
Nastenka. The little girl slapped the beast on the back with her tiny hands, tugged at its fur and touched its snout. By way of reply, the she-wolf licked the child’s foot, 
but that’s where the mutual signs of attention or affection ended. Playing with the she-wolf evidently didn’t enter into Nastenka’s plans. She wanted to get to the water, 
which she first tried to do by taking three steps to the side and walking around the she-wolf that was standing at that spot. But as soon as the little girl tried to move 
ahead, the she-wolf once again blocked her path. Nastenka pushed against the beast’s side with her hands, attempting to remove the obstacle, but the she-wolf didn’t obey the 
child and stood there, as if rooted to the spot. Then Nastenka sat down on the grass, thought a bit and made an attempt to crawl under the she-wolf’s belly. But this attempt 
did not meet with success, either – the she-wolf pressed herself to the ground.</p><p>Evidently Nastenka understood that the beast was not letting her get to the water and that she 
could not remove the obstacle using force. She sat on the grass for some time, pondering something, then started to crawl and even move away from the she-wolf and the lake.</p><p>Before long she stood up, a small twig in her hands. She walked up to the she-wolf’s snout, ran the twig along it and threw it in the direction of the forest. The twig only 
flew about a meter and a half. The she-wolf jumped for the twig and grabbed it with her teeth. As this was going on, Nastenka set off running toward the shore of the lake, 
her legs pumping away. The she-wolf understood she’d been outsmarted, and with two headlong jumps, she caught up to the child at the water’s edge and knocked her off her 
feet.</p><p>Nastenka fell onto her back, and her head touched the water. Pushing against the sand with her little legs, she tried to push herself further out, into the lake. The 
she-wolf grabbed the child’s foot with her teeth. She was probably trying not to cause the child any pain – her grip was light.</p><p>Nastenka pushed her second leg into the she-
wolf’s nose, pulled the sole of her foot from the she-wolf’s maw and, in high spirits, crawled off into the water. The shore in that spot dropped off sharply to the depth of 
almost a meter, and the little tot was submerged in the water up to her head, but right then she dove out. Working her little arms and legs, she kept herself on the surface 
of the water.</p><p>I didn’t think our daughter could swim well. I ran out of my hiding place, intending to jump into the water, but when I got to the shore, I saw the she-wolf 
swimming up to the child. Splashing about in the water, the little girl nestled against the wolf’s side and took hold of the fur with her little hands, and they swam along 
the shore in the shallows. Nastenka let go of the she-wolf as soon as she felt the lake bed beneath her feet.</p><p>The wet she-wolf came out onto the shore and shook herself, the 
splashing spray glinting in the sun. She didn’t run away, but remained on the shore, attentively watching the child out of the corner of her eye and also – as it seemed to me 
– warily glancing at me.</p><p>And Nastenka, standing in the water up to her waist, smiled and eagerly kept calling the she-wolf to come over to her. She’d slap her little hands on 
the water, and beckon her with a wave, but the she-wolf didn’t go to her. It’s possible that the beast didn’t like this watery business, or that the games in the lake seemed 
dangerous.</p><p>Nastenka suddenly turned her little head in my direction and froze. For the first time I felt my little daughter’s gaze fixed on me, and I stood there beneath her 
gaze, powerless to move a muscle. I understood that she perceived me as some kind of baffling creature that had suddenly appeared in the territory she inhabited.</p><p>She looked me 
over for some time, then turned away and came out of the water onto the shore, taking her time, and walked up to the she-wolf lying on the grass. The she-wolf picked up the 
little dress in her teeth and gave it to the little girl. But Nastenka didn’t want to put it on her damp body. She took the clothing and set off in the direction of the dug-
out at the edge of the glade. I continued observing her path through the taiga and thinking.</p><p>A tiny child is walking, smiling, through a glade deep in the Siberian taiga, and 
nothing frightens her, no one attacks her. Quite the contrary – the wild animals are prepared to rush to her aid at a moment’s notice. A tiny person is walking along, the way 
a royal heir walks through her kingdom. It’s interesting for her to observe how the bugs and squirrels and birds live. To examine the flowers and test the blades of grass and 
berries to see how they taste.</p><p>But at this same time, some other little girl of the very same age finds herself in a space bounded by four walls, and within it, she’s confined 
within four little playpen walls like some kind of little wild animal, and it doesn’t matter that the walls are pretty. And her kind parents buy up all sorts of plastic toys 
for her, and she tests them to see how they taste.</p><p>Millions of little girls and boys in our world grow up in apartment-cages, like little wild animals. And then we want them 
to grow up into intelligent, free, and noble people.</p><p>Well, these individuals can’t even imagine… freedom first of all means free thought, knowledge, and perception of the 
living universe.</p><p>A child will be told about this living universe in school when he grows up a bit. Of course he’ll receive certain information about the great world of living 
nature, about the universe created by the great Creator, but he’ll never be able to perceive it through his own experience. You can’t replace the perceptions a person can 
receive in the first years of his life while living in harmony with the great world of the Creator, not through exerting effort or straining himself, but conversely, through 
playing. There are no school lessons or university lectures at all that can replace this.</p><p>I’m not encouraging anyone to head out to the taiga with children. That would be 
idiotic. Even so, we have to do something.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1003>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>3. Who does our Daughter Look Like? 
</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div></p><p> </p><p>In the evening, Anastasia was nursing Nastenka at the entrance to the little dug-out where the 
little girl sometimes slept on her own. I was sitting quietly alongside them, watching this interesting process.</p><p>I got the impression that the feeding as such, as a means of 
satiating the child’s organism with mother’s milk, was not the main point of it at all. Grabbing Anastasia’s breast with her little hands, Nastenka smacked her lips and 
nursed for a bit, but then she came off the nipple and looked at her mother’s face. And Anastasia didn’t take her eyes off her child, either. She paid no attention to me or 
to her surroundings.</p><p>It seemed to me that it was as if mother and child became one during the feeding and communicated with each other non-verbally.</p><p>This went on for about 
twenty minutes, after which time Nastenka fell asleep.</p><p>Anastasia put our little daughter down in the dug-out on bedding made of hay and covered with fabric. She covered the 
sleeping child with the fabric’s loose edges and created a cozy little nest by mounding up hay from the sides. Then, she knelt there by the entrance for a short while, 
looking at her sleeping daughter. When Anastasia stood up and finally turned her attention to me, I asked her:</p><p>“What do you think, Anastasia, who does our daughter look more 
like, you or me?”</p><p>“Like all parents, of course you’d like it if she looked more like you, wouldn’t you, Vladimir?”</p><p>“Ah, you guessed wrong. Sure, I want my daughter to have 
something of me in her, too. But she’s a little girl – she needs to be beautiful, and that means, she should look more like you.”</p><p>“Does that mean you consider me beautiful 
compared to yourself, Vladimir?”</p><p>“I consider you beautiful compared not just with myself, Anastasia. I think you’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen, even in 
international beauty contests. I’ve watched them on television. The contestants’ beauty pales by comparison with yours. You’re better than all of them.”</p><p>“Thank you, Vladimir. 
What you said – is that a compliment? Or just an explanation?”</p><p>“I’m complimenting you and explaining, too, and also marveling.”</p><p>“Thank you. That means it won’t sadden you then, 
Vladimir, if I tell you that in her external appearance, Nastenka’s little face looks a tiny bit like you, but her little eyes and eyelashes and her figure are mine, and 
she’ll also have hair like mine.</p><p>“When people resemble each other physically this also indicates that they resemble each other in their abilities, habits and in the affinity 
of their Souls. That means she’ll possess certain abilities and habits of yours. And certain ones of mine. But three components are always present in a newborn’s soul, 
Vladimir.”</p><p>‘Three? But who’s the third one from?”</p><p>“The third component is a particle of the Soul that resided in the person’s body in his previous life – perhaps a hundred 
years ago, perhaps a thousand or a million years ago. In a harmonious person, this third component does not disintegrate into particles, but waits for its chance, for the 
instant when it acquires a new body, through whose eyes it can see the surrounding world and through whose ears it can hear the sounds of this world, touch it with its hands, 
and utilize its gifts.”</p><p>“But if our Souls have united into one whole in their new life, then does that mean they must know about all of each other’s lives?”</p><p>“Of course, they 
must. And they do. Otherwise it would be impossible for them to unite. They wouldn’t be able to become one united Soul.”</p><p>“Then it would follow that my Soul can see our 
daughter’s past life?”</p><p>“Of course, it can, but you will perceive and see this only if you are able to abide in harmony with your own Soul and if your thought isn’t thrown off 
by all manner of distortions of the surrounding world, if it is able to concentrate.”</p><p>“If you take me, then everything’s totally clear: I and people like me can’t see the 
past. But if you take you, Anastasia – it’s clear that you can find something out about our daughter’s past life through that particle of her Soul.”</p><p>“I’ve been trying to 
glimpse and understand our daughter’s past life, Vladimir, and I’m seeing it as strange in some way. Our daughter’s life in her body was very short, no more than seven years 
long, and she lived many thousands of years ago.”</p><p>“Well, if the child lived such a short life, there’s not much to learn about the past.”</p><p>“Yes, not much, but it sometimes 
happens that even in the course of a very short life, a person carries out an act that can affect events that occur in subsequent millennia.”</p><p>“I wonder, how can it happen that 
a child could carry out some act that could affect people’s lives for millennia? Can you tell me about it, Anastasia, or better yet, can you play back some pictures from our 
daughter’s past life?”</p><p>“Yes, I can, Vladimir.”</p><p>“Go ahead and play them back, then.”</p><p>And Anastasia began the extraordinary tale of our daughter’s past life. Or, rather, the tale 
of the little girl, a particle of whose Soul now resides in little Nastenka.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1004>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>4. Into a Different 
Dimension</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“As you know, Vladimir, some time ago on Earth there began an ice age. In those regions 
into which the glaciers advanced, the climate changed. The cooling made it impossible for many types of plants to grow. Areas that had previously been rich in forests, 
orchards and lush grasses interspersed with flowers, gradually turned into valleys covered with only scant vegetation.</p><p>“The people who were living at that time in one of the 
valleys in the foothills decided that it was impossible to continue living the way they had been living under such cold conditions. They decided to leave their homes and head 
out in search of places with a more hospitable climate.</p><p>“The men headed out and took the lead. Following their tracks, the head of the family line, Wood2, was leading the 
children, women and old folks out of the settlement.</p><p>“The gray-haired, hundred-and-twenty-year-old elder walked at the head of the caravan of eleven mammoths laden with wicker 
baskets. The children were seated in one of them, and the others held food stores – after all, they didn’t know how long they would be traveling.</p><p>“Along both sides of the 
caravan of mammoths, the people of his family line and all the livestock who had resided in the family homestead settlement were on the move, on horseback and on foot. It 
seemed that all the living beings understood that it was essential for them to set off for new climes, and they followed the person. Only the plants had remained in the 
settlement – they had no way to move. Plants, doomed to die.</p><p>“Wood was thinking things over, trying to answer the questions he’d posed to himself:</p><p>“Why had the undesirable 
changes in nature occurred? Why had the cooling begun?</p><p>“Whose will had set this disaster in motion?</p><p>“Might it not become a disaster for all of Earth?</p><p>“Did man possess the power 
to do something to head it off?</p><p>“Might disasters result from man’s actions?</p><p>“Wood understood that if the answers weren’t found, then a sad fate would await his children and 
grandchildren and his entire family line. He could see that all the adults who were now walking along in the caravan were viewing the changes in the natural world as a 
tragedy – their faces were sad and thoughtful. Even the children had grown quiet and were on their guard. Only his little favorite, his six-year-old great-granddaughter 
Anasta3, was frolicking – she’d started up a game at the head of the caravan with the lead mammoth.</p><p>“Wood observed his great-granddaughter’s game with the mammoth leader, 
glancing at them out of the corner of his eye. She plopped the tip of the giant, seven-ton mammoth’s trunk onto her little shoulder and made believe she was dragging the huge 
animal. And he, the mammoth, was playing along with her. Of course, he was carrying the whole weight of the trunk himself, touching the child’s shoulder only lightly with it. 
From time to time Anasta would stop, as if catching her breath, wipe the nonexistent sweat from her brow and say, ‘Oh, my, how big you are. You’re heavy and lazy.’</p><p>“The 
mammoth would nod his head, as if in agreement, flap his ears, and wipe his own brow with his trunk. Then he’d lay the tip of it on the little girl’s shoulder once more, as 
if he couldn’t move from the spot without her help. The game was funny and harmless. But the other game his great-granddaughter started up next, Wood didn’t like that one. 
Here’s what it consisted of.</p><p>“Anasta would scramble up the mammoth’s trunk, up to his head, and he would help her, curving his huge trunk and pushing the child higher with its 
tip. After getting herself settled atop the moving mammoth’s head, Anasta would sit there for a while, then suddenly utter a frightened ‘Oh!’ and swiftly slide down the 
trunk. The mammoth had to be very dexterous to manage to catch the child right above the ground and prevent her from hitting the ground or ending up beneath his massive 
feet.</p><p>“Wood was thinking over the past, trying to discover in it the reason for the disaster that had forced his people to leave their native valley, but his reflections were 
constantly being interrupted by recollection-pictures from the life of his great-granddaughter Anasta. He didn’t push these pictures away. He liked them, and they distracted 
him from sorrowful thoughts about what had happened.</p><p>“At one point Wood even smiled, recalling the way Anasta had registered her objection to an opinion that had been posited 
during one of their lessons. He saw the whole picture, down to the smallest detail.</p><p>“Wood was giving the lesson at that point. Children of various ages and three adults were 
sitting in front of him in a circle, beneath a spreading oak tree. Wood started off the lesson with the following words.”</p><p><div class=chapter id=1005>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>5. Snake Go-betweens</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“Many people know that our ancestors strived to 
determine the life’s purpose of all creatures living on Earth. Once they’d done so, they would teach the animals how they could become as useful as possible to people. The 
animals would then teach this to their offspring, and in this way our generation, just like any that came before it, has received a great gift from our forbears. And we, in 
turn, need to not just make use of it, but also perfect the abilities of all earthly creatures living around us. It’s our generation’s task to determine the life’s purpose of 
those creatures for whom our ancestors didn’t do so.” Having said this, Wood pulled a grass snake out from under his shirt and continued: “For example, we need to determine 
for what purpose reptiles were created and how they might serve man.”</p><p>Those who were present looked at the grass snake that had wrapped itself around Wood’s hand, and said 
nothing. The first to raise his hand and ask to speak was a red-haired little boy about five years of age. Wood permitted him to speak.</p><p>“I’ve seen that snake,” the little boy 
began, “or one just like it, crawl up to our nanny goat and suck milk out of its udder. The goat stood right where she was. That means she agreed to give it her milk.”</p><p>“Yes, 
grass snakes and other reptiles can suck milk from cows or goats. You’re correct in noting that, Izor4. But at the moment,” Wood reminded those who had gathered, “we’re 
trying to solve the question of what benefit the existence of these creatures should bring to man.”</p><p>“Yes, I haven’t forgotten about our question,” the red-haired boy went on. 
“I remembered the way he was drinking the milk, and I thought we should make a little hole in this creature at the opposite end from his head. He can drink the milk and lower 
his tail with the little hole into a pitcher so it fills up with milk. Then mama won’t have to milk the goat.”</p><p>A disorderly choir of children’s voices could be heard from all 
sides:</p><p>“You can’t put a little hole in…”</p><p>“You shouldn’t put a hole in – it’ll be painful for the creature!”</p><p>“The milk won’t run out of the hole if the creature itself doesn’t 
want it to.”</p><p>“The main argument against the hole is the pain the grass snake will experience,” Wood said, summarizing. “And man shouldn’t cause earthly creatures pain. Your 
suggestion is not accepted, Izor.”</p><p>Wood wanted to move onto the next question, but the red-haired boy wasn’t giving up.</p><p>“If we can’t put a little hole in his tail, then we can 
do it some other way,” he announced. “When that creature was sucking the milk from the goat, it got fatter and fatter. That happened because there was a lot of milk in it. We 
need to train the creature to crawl into the house with its milk and pour it out, into a pitcher. Then people won’t have to go out to the pasture with a pitcher to fetch the 
milk, and the dairy animals won’t have to leave the pasture and come to the houses to be milked. Many different creatures will crawl to the house, and when they see that the 
pitcher is empty, they’ll fill it with milk.”</p><p>The children liked the red-haired boy’s idea, and they vied to outdo each other with their own additions to it.</p><p>“And you could 
also get milk from them far away from home, if you feel like eating and your house is a long ways away.”</p><p>“We need to train them to crawl up to a person with milk when they 
hear a certain sound. So we don’t have to go searching for them in the grass. You clap your hands, say, or whistle, and they’d race to crawl right over to the person.”</p><p>“Well, 
I don’t feel like drinking milk that’s been pumped out of a snake – they might add some snake thing of their own to it,” one little girl noted timidly. But the others 
immediately started arguing with her.</p><p>“Well, with a cow the milk was inside, too, and everyone drinks that.”</p><p>“If they add some snake thing of their own, then it’ll be even 
better. I mean, they, these creatures, are always clean, even though they crawl along the ground.”</p><p>“Yes, exactly, they’re always nice and clean. I never saw a filthy snake.”</p><p>Izor listened as the children discussed his proposal, and he even blushed from pride.</p><p>“Your second suggestion is worthy of attention, Izor,” Wood said, praising the boy, and 
then he added: “We’ll discuss your second suggestion next time, and before then, everyone will think and give their opinion or propose their own suggestion for how to make 
use of creatures that crawl. And now I want to ask you what life’s purposes have been determined for the animals you know. Who’s ready…”</p><p>Wood didn’t finish what he was saying. 
He saw Anasta’s little raised hand, her palm facing in his direction. This gesture indicated that the little girl disagreed with something and intended to lay her objections 
out to those present.</p><p>“Tell us your objections, Anasta,” Wood said, giving his permission.</p><p>“I’m against having creepy crawlers deliver milk to homes.”</p><p>One after another, the 
children began challenging Anasta:</p><p>“But why?”</p><p>“We don’t have to say no to conveniences!”</p><p>“The creatures aren’t doing anything for man at the moment, and this way they’ll have 
something to do.”</p><p>“People will have more time to do something nice instead of milking cows.”</p><p>The little girl calmly heard out the objections and went on:</p><p>“If the creepy crawlers 
start bringing man milk from the cow, then man himself will turn into a cow.”</p><p>One of the adults who was present at the lesson couldn’t restrain himself:</p><p>“What are you talking 
about, little girl? Explain what you mean.”</p><p>And Anasta went on:</p><p>“When a person receives milk from a cow or a goat or a camel or some other animal, he gives the animal his 
attention and feelings in return. If he doesn’t take the milk from the cow himself, and if she doesn’t feel his attention, then the milk won’t be as good. The person will 
give his feelings of gratitude to the crawling creature when he gets the snake milk from it. The snake will come between the cow and the person. It will be a go-between 
between all creations and the person. It will lure the person in with its enticing service and will milk him, sucking out of him the beneficial feelings that were intended 
for all the earthly creatures.”</p><p>Everyone remained silent for some time, lost in thought.</p><p>All at once a picture arose in Wood’s imagination: a spreading apple tree, studded with 
ripe fruit. Before it were standing a man and a woman. The woman was saying:</p><p>“Look, my love – one apple has already ripened. It’s very pretty. The apple tree wants to give it 
to us. Reach up to the branch and bend it down and pick the ripe apple.”</p><p>The man tried to reach the branch, but couldn’t. He wanted to jump up and grab hold of the branch with 
the ripe apple, but right then a snake appeared on the branch. It pulled off the apple, took hold of the branch with its tail and obligingly hung there, offering the fruit to 
Man.</p><p>“Thank you, crawling one,” Man said and stroked the snake.</p><p>The man and the woman moved away from the tree without thanking it. They gave the beneficial energy of their 
feelings to the snake. The apple tree shuddered, and half of its fruit, still unripe, fell to the ground.</p><p>And Wood broke the silence that had fallen:</p><p>“Your protest is also 
worthy of attention, Anastochka5, and we accept it in part. We must all think carefully about replacing man’s direct connection to all that grows and lives on Earth with a 
go-between. We need to think about what that might lead to in the future. I propose that we return to this topic in our future lessons. But now,” he said, glancing at all 
those who had gathered there, “as we agreed to do earlier, please tell me the life’s purposes of the animals you know.”</p><p> <div class=chapter id=1006>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>6. The most important Instrument for Building a House</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“Me! Me!” the 
impatient children’s voices poured out.</p><p>“All right, all right,” Wood said, nodding, “Tell me one at a time, and each of you name no more than two animals’ life’s purposes.”</p><p>One 
at a time, the children jumped up from their spots and spoke quickly:</p><p>“Cows and goats give milk. They eat grass, and every day they come to a person so he’ll take the milk 
from them.”</p><p>“Donkeys and horsies are meant to haul a person when he doesn’t want to walk on his own two legs.”</p><p>“Chickens and ducks walk around somewhere and fly around 
somewhere, but nearly every day they come back and lay eggs so a person can come get them.”</p><p>“We need a mammoth to lift heavy things and move or carry them to the place a 
person shows him.”</p><p>The children were already going around the circle for the third time, striving to recall the life’s purposes of all the animals they knew. Finally Wood 
posed a new question.</p><p>“Who can tell me under what circumstances animals work together and in what way a person directs them?”</p><p>The very same red-haired little boy addressed 
those present, saying, “Can I tell?” And, hearing no objections, he looked at Wood. The latter nodded in assent. “Animals start working together when a person wants to build 
himself a home6. Now, the person uses a fife to direct the animals. First he plays a calling tune, and various wild animals come to him, and birds fly over. When they come, 
they sit down not far from him and wait – that’s the way our forbears taught them. When he finishes playing the calling tune, the person looks affectionately at all the 
animals and bows to them. And all the animals that have little tails all wag them joyfully when the person looks at them affectionately. And the ones that can’t wag little 
tails express their joy in some other way, because the nicest thing for all animals is when a person looks at them affectionately. Then the person makes a different sound on 
his fife. Right away the bears run out from the group of wild animals and start digging a pit in the ground, right on the spot the person has marked with twigs. When the 
person thinks the pit doesn’t need to be dug any bigger, he makes a different sound on his fife, and the bears go back to their spots. When the new sound is played, the 
mammoths place stones in the pit the bears dug. This whole time, a whole lot of swallows are circling about the chosen spot, very impatiently waiting to hear their tune. And 
as soon as the person begins playing their pretty tune on his fife, the swallows race off every which way and come back again and again: they bring tiny little bits of dirt, 
straw and fluff in their little beaks – everything they use to build nests for themselves, and they lay what they’ve brought on top of the stones until they’ve got a wall of 
the home.”</p><p>The little boy stopped speaking, and Wood saw that Anasta had once again gotten up from her spot and raised her hand with the palm facing him. Wood gave Anasta 
permission to speak.</p><p>“Teacher Wood, I want to ask you whether the building of a home is considered pleasant and interesting work.”</p><p>“Yes, of course,” Wood answered. “It is the 
very pleasant and creative act of a thinking person.”</p><p>“Teacher Wood, but then why are children categorically forbidden to engage in this pleasant and creative act?”</p><p>Wood knew 
of Anasta’s obsession with the idea of building her own little home. At home she’d brought up this topic with Wood many times, but he would always patiently explain to her 
why children weren’t allowed to build homes. Now she’d posed her question to Wood in front of the children and adults alike. Clearly she had a reason for asking. “She’s 
thought of something,” Wood concluded, and he began to answer:</p><p>“If children, especially those who haven’t fully grasped the essence of the universe, pick up a fife and begin 
playing it, they might unwittingly distort the tune, and the animal builders will get confused and not know what to do.”</p><p>“Teacher Wood, may I show you something?” Anasta 
asked.</p><p>“Yes, you may, if it’s related to your question.”</p><p>“It’s related,” Anasta replied, and she began to sing. She began singing ever so quietly. She offered up various tunes 
in her thin little voice, the very same tunes that adults would play during building.</p><p>“She didn’t make a single mistake,” one of the elders who was present remarked quietly.</p><p>“That’s right, she didn’t make any mistakes,” agreed another.</p><p>“But you know, she’s only heard that tune once,” stressed the elder who was sitting on a fallen tree in the last 
row. “The little girl has a good memory,” he added.</p><p>When she was done singing, Anasta asked Wood:</p><p>“Teacher Wood, did I make even a single mistake in even a single tune?”</p><p>“You 
did not distort the tunes, Anasta. You reproduced them with total accuracy.”</p><p>“Then I’ve removed the first obstacle?”</p><p>“Let’s say you’ve removed it,” Wood admitted. “But there 
are also other conditions. One of the children may be allowed to build a home, as an exceptional case. This can happen if that individual – in this case one of you – tells 
about the design they’ve conceived and the elders pronounce this design innovative. Then they may permit the home to be built as an exceptional case, as a model.”</p><p>Sensing that 
an extremely favorable situation had arisen, and that he could stimulate the creative thought of the children who were present, Wood said:</p><p>“I propose that all of you who wish 
to do so present your designs in two moons’ time. First we’ll discuss all the designs and will pick the best one, and then we’ll propose to the elders that they examine it 
and hand down a decision.”</p><p>Wood hadn’t been mistaken: both the tiniest children and those who were a bit older felt a burning desire to present their own unique designs. They 
all began whispering amongst themselves, evidently discussing what innovations they might introduce into the methods of building a home that had been worked out over the 
centuries. Understanding that there was no point in continuing class any longer, since the children were occupied with trying to solve the task that had been set for them and 
it was unlikely he’d succeed in shifting their thought, which was fired-up by its creative search, he stopped the lessons and dismissed those who were present.</p><p>Two moons 
later, the day the children had long been waiting for arrived. Many up them came to class a bit early and, without waiting for the older ones, began telling each other what 
they’d thought up. By the appointed time, many parents had gathered at the lesson, too. When class began, each of the children, excited, took turns telling of his design.</p><p>According to established rules, Anasta was to present her design last. Out of the designs presented before her presentation, the best design turned out to be the one 
presented by a little by named Alan7. He was a good-looking boy, eight years older than Anasta, a good singer whom all the domestic animals happily obeyed just the way they 
would a grown-up. Many of the girls in the settlement liked this boy, including Anasta. Therefore, if he were to win, she wouldn’t be terribly upset. “Better him than anyone 
else,” Anasta thought.</p><p>Finally it was her turn to present her design. Trying not to show her excitement, she began to tell about it:</p><p>“On the surface, my design doesn’t differ 
much from already existing ones. My innovation is in the wall. In the southern-facing wall. I’ll situate a beehive log on it. When the bees start bringing back flower pollen 
and the sun begins to warm the log hive, the bees will have to fan it with their little wings. Now, the log hive will be connected to the house by means of a small opening, 
and the air from the hive will fill the person’s room, along with the scent of the flowers.”</p><p>The grown-ups began talking amongst themselves, discussing Anasta’s innovation. 
Finally Wood made a decision that everyone agreed with. It was decided to present two designs to the elders for consideration: Alan’s and Anasta’s. Anasta wasn’t pleased – 
she didn’t particularly feel like being rival to the boy she liked.</p><p>The elders came together the next day to consider the designs, right at the next lesson, which a great many 
people had also come to attend. Anasta’s design was deemed best. The solemn announcement was made by a gray-haired, stern-looking elder. But he did note:</p><p>“Anasta, we have 
deemed your design worthy of attention. It really does contain an interesting innovation, but we cannot allow you to build the home. We can’t turn the building of a home into 
a child’s game. Only a man and woman who have decided to create a family may build a home. That is the inviolable rule. Do you agree with this rule?”</p><p>Anasta said nothing. The 
lump that had risen in her throat prevented her from speaking. She had worked on her design with extraordinary inspiration. She had imagined and even sensed her little home. 
In her thoughts she was already living in it, sleeping on her soft sleeping spot, looking out the window at the beautiful flower beds through the curtain woven by a little 
spider, and breathing in the subtle scents of the flowers the bees had brought back… Right then Alan rose from his spot.</p><p>“Might you allow me to say a word about the inviolable 
rule?” He glanced questioningly at the elders and then continued. “Of course it’s fair, and it can’t be changed, but there’s a way to do things so that the rule won’t apply 
to Anasta.”</p><p>The people and the children were looking at Alan in disbelief.</p><p>A voice rang out. “And just how could that be done?”</p><p>“Allow me to demonstrate,” Alan said.</p><p>An elder 
consented. “Go on, then, show us.”</p><p>Alan walked up to Anasta and stood opposite her. Then he removed the family pendant from his neck and placed it around Anasta’s neck:</p><p>“Will 
you marry me, Anasta?” he asked.</p><p>Those present gasped. Anasta was struck dumb. Only her eyes shone and looked over the youth before her, from toe to head.</p><p>“Do you say yes, 
Anasta?” Alan asked.</p><p>Anasta nodded energetically, then quickly took her own family pendant off her neck and held it out to Alan. But he didn’t take it. Instead, he knelt down 
before the little girl so that she could place her beautiful pendant on him herself.</p><p>The people watched what was happening in astonishment. Then Alan took Anasta’s little hand 
and addressed the gray-haired elder, saying:</p><p>“Now there’s no obstacle for Anasta, and the inviolable rule does not apply to her.”</p><p>“All right,” the elder began, a bit unsure, 
somehow, “but people come together in order to raise a family. Anasta’s still too little. She can’t bear children.”</p><p>“Yes,” Alan agreed. “She’s little. But she will mature with 
each day and each year. And the day will come when she will be a fully mature beauty. I am sure that I will see that day and that I will not go back on my decision.”</p><p>After 
conferring with each other, the elders gave Anasta permission to build the small home, under the condition that it would be disassembled after eleven days, since it wasn’t 
permissible for the home to be unoccupied, and Anasta wasn’t yet allowed to live apart from her parents, due to her age.</p><p>On the appointed day, nearly all the residents of the 
family homestead settlement came together on a hillock. Anasta stood beside her flower bed. Beforehand, she’d marked out the border of her little home with sticks and twigs. 
She was very nervous – after all, so many people would be watching her actions, but she was especially nervous because among these people was Alan. Some unique feelings 
toward this young man had been born within her after his proposal that they join their lives together. The village head walked up to Anasta and opened a pretty case before 
her. Inside it there lay a fife – the most important instrument for building a house. With trembling hands, the little girl took up the fife, covered several little holes 
with her small fingers and brought the fife to her lips. But no tune issued forth – Anasta felt that before beginning, she needed to calm herself somehow. She pressed the 
fife to her chest and, gazing at the people standing on the hillock, she thought, fast as lightning, about what she could do to calm herself down. But her nervousness was 
only growing.</p><p>Then a youth came out of the group of people and headed toward Anasta. It was Alan. He walked up to the little girl and said:</p><p>“I know this tune, too, and I can 
play it. You’ve laid out where the house will be located and how big it will be. You were victorious in our competition. That means this will be your home. All I’ll do is 
play the tune.”</p><p>With eyes shining with tears, the little girl looked at the stately youth and whispered with lips trembling with excitement:</p><p>“I want to do it myself, Alan. 
Thank you, but I need to do it myself, I definitely need to.”</p><p>“Then listen to me carefully, Anasta. Breathe in some air and hold your breath. Hold it for as long as you can 
and then exhale, but not all at once, but in three steps. Exhale the last time so that as little air as possible remains in you. After that, begin to breathe evenly. From 
your very first breath, you should think only about your breathing. Forget about everything around you, and as soon as your breathing settles in normally, begin playing. I’ll 
stand behind your back and look at the people on the hillock. I won’t let their glances and thoughts through, won’t allow them to touch you, and you, calm and confident, will 
build your little fairy tale home.”</p><p>Anasta did everything just the way Alan had instructed her. She brought the fife to her now-calmed lips and… the calling tune filled the 
space.</p><p>After a bit the wild animals began gathering from the forest and the pastures. When enough of them had gathered, Anasta brought the calling tune to an end, went and 
stood in the middle of the oval that marked the walls of her future little home, and began playing once more, a different tune now.</p><p>Three bears immediately came out from the 
group of animals and hopping, ran up to the oval Anasta had drawn, walked around it in a circle, sniffing, and started digging a pit alongside the twigs Anasta had laid out.</p><p>They were trying, trying very hard. Suddenly two little bear cubs just couldn’t hold back and jumped into the pit that their mother was digging. Thrown off, Anasta stopped 
playing. Everyone froze in place. Then the she-bear grabbed one of the cubs by the shoulder and, giving it a slap, set it down outside the pit. It rolled off, head over 
heels, and she went through the same procedure with the second cub. Then she roared at them, as a warning, looked at the little girl holding the fife and waved a paw in her 
direction like a conductor. And Anasta began playing the fife once more.</p><p>When the pit had been dug, Anasta changed tunes – there rang out low, sedate and rhythmical sounds. 
And one after another, mammoths walked out toward the pit, each carrying a stone with its trunk. The mammoths placed the stones and continued their work until they had filled 
the entire pit with them. Now the fife’s low, rhythmical tones were replaced by modulations resembling the twittering of birds. The swallows that had been circling above the 
building site suddenly disappeared, as if on cue, but reappeared before long. They landed on the stones, first here, then there, laying down something from their beaks.</p><p>The 
little feathered builders were able to bring just a tiny bit of building material in their beaks, but there were a great many of them, and they carried out their actions 
unusually swiftly and in unison. And so, the walls of the home grew before everyone’s very eyes, accompanied by the fife’s melodious modulations.</p><p> <div class=chapter id=1007>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>7. Don't get ahead of Yourself</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Wood’s 
recollections of his great-granddaughter Anasta’s life just wouldn’t leave him alone, and he even chuckled a bit, recalling one particular instance.</p><p>It was getting toward 
evening. Wood had washed his feet off in the stream and was getting ready to go to sleep when he suddenly heard a child crying, or not even crying, but sobbing. He turned 
around and saw Anasta running toward him. She looked unusual: her face was all smeared with something black, and hay was sticking out of the opening of her dress. She ran up 
to Wood, limping a bit, sat down on the earthen mound outside and, taking her head in her hands, began lamenting her sad state.</p><p>“Oh, woe is me, Granddad! My life is just 
coming to an end.”</p><p>Now that Alan had proposed to her, the little girl wanted to grow up as soon as possible, and when she’d wake up in the morning, instead of running off to 
the stream pool to get washed, she’d take a straight pole, stand it up against the wall of the house and score it, to mark her height. And then at the stream pool, before 
taking a dip in the water, she’d look at her reflection and wonder how long it would be before she’d get breasts like the ones grown-up women have – the kind of breasts they 
nurse little children with.</p><p>“Have a drink of water, Anastochka and calm down. Tell me what’s happened.”</p><p>Anasta swallowed some water from the pitcher and, through her sobs, 
began telling Wood the tale of her woe.</p><p>“I knew it, Granddad, I knew it… They are all crazy about Alan because he’s the handsomest and the smartest. I’ve been worried that in 
the time it takes me to grow up, one of the grown-up maidens will make my Alan fall in love with her. She’ll make him love her. And today, when it was just getting towards 
evening, I saw them, these maidens, walking to the glade, toward the mountain, and they were talking about my Alan. And I realized I can’t wait any more, can’t wait ‘til I 
grow up. I have to take action now. That’s what I decided, and I started to take action.</p><p>“I took a little piece of coal and made up my eyes, the way the grown-up maidens do 
it. Then I took a beet and painted my cheeks and my lips. And I even covered over my birthmark with clay. The birthmark that’s right here, on my forehead.” Anasta pulled 
aside her bangs and showed Wood the birthmark on her forehead that resembled a tiny star.</p><p>“Why in the world did you try to paint over the birthmark, Anastochka? After all, you 
can’t see it – your beautiful hair covers it,” asked Wood, concealing his smile.</p><p>“Sure, it covers it. But the wind blows, and it comes uncovered.”</p><p>“Let it come uncovered. I, 
for example, like your birthmark very much. It resembles a little star.”</p><p>“Agh-h-h,” Anasta said, wailing again. “You like it, Granddad, but I don’t like it one bit. It’s like 
I’m marked somehow. Mama doesn’t have a little star on her forehead, and neither does Papa, and you don’t have one, either, Granddad Wood. Who drew it on my forehead? Who was 
it who mutilated me? Agh-h-h…”</p><p>“No one mutilated you, Anastochka. Quite the opposite – they adorned you. If you start doing kind deeds for people, they’ll start saying that 
this act, say, was done by the little girl with the little star on her forehead. And if you do bad deeds, people might say, that was done by the little girl with the spot on 
her forehead. People see any person’s appearance as beautiful if his deeds are beautiful.” Wood stroked his great-granddaughter’s head and then asked, “Anasta, tell me: why 
is there some hay peeking out of your dress?”</p><p>“I made two little wads of hay and tied them to my chest with a ribbon, so my chest would be the same as the grown-up maidens’. 
And I put hay in my shoes under my heels, too, so I’d be a little taller. And then, all grown up, like a maiden, I went out to the glade where they get together with the 
young fellows. I got there and I saw Alan standing there along with the young guys, and the maidens had gathered together a little ways away from them and were talking 
amongst themselves, sneaking glances at Alan. And Alan himself was glancing at the maidens.” And once again Anasta got all worked up and started crying again, and then went 
on, through her tears. “I saw him, Granddad, he was sneaking glances, sneaking glances. I knew that before long they’d get into a circle and take each other’s hands and 
they’d do a circle dance and sing and look at each other. And so I’d be able to get into the circle, too, I went up and stood next to the maidens.</p><p>“One of them was just 
staring at me. She looks and looks and then she up and starts roaring with laughter and all the rest of them too, when they see me, they start roaring with laughter. And all 
the guys standing with Alan, they were laughing, too. Oh, woe is me! Woe is me, Granddad Wood. I was standing there alone, and they were all laughing and laughing. Looking at 
me and laughing. One guy fell right over onto the grass – he was rolling around and laughing.”</p><p>Wood looked down, trying to hide his smile, and asked:</p><p>“Was Alan laughing at you, 
too, Anastochka?”</p><p>“Alan wasn’t laughing at me, Granddad Wood, not at all. Alan hit me.”</p><p>Wood was astonished. “He hit you? What do you mean, he hit you?”</p><p>“Just what I said, 
Granddad Wood. He hit me. First he walked up and picked me up. Picked me up the way you’d pick up a little child,” she told him, blubbering. “And I… I so wanted to be a 
grown-up… But he… he picked up me up like a little kid and took me behind the bushes. There he set me down on the path and said, ‘Go along home, Anasta. Wash up and don’t be 
such a dummy any more.’ And I… I said I wouldn’t go, and so it would be convincing, I stomped my foot a few times. Then he took me by the hand and spanked me. Like this and 
like that,” Anasta said, slapping herself on the hip with her palm, all the while lamenting, “Now I’m all beaten up and unhappy and abandoned and unmarried.”</p><p>“What, did he 
take back his pendant from you?” Wood asked.</p><p>“No, he didn’t take it back.”</p><p>“Well, that means you’re still married,” Wood said, reasoning with her.</p><p>“All the same, even if I’m 
married, I’m still beaten up and wretched.”</p><p>“Did it really hurt so much when Alan spanked you?” Wood asked.</p><p>“I don’t know, Granddad. I don’t know. I didn’t feel any pain, but 
the bitter insult was stronger than any pain.”</p><p>“Calm down, Anastochka. I can see that Alan spanked you out of love, so you wouldn’t do things people would laugh at you for. 
That means he was shielding you from taunting in the future.”</p><p>“Out of love? Do people really spank you like that when they love you?”</p><p>“Well, of course, that’s not the best 
method, but perhaps at that moment Alan couldn’t think of anything better. And you know, Anastochka,” Wood went on, untying the bundles and taking the little wads of hay off 
her chest, “don’t try so hard to be grown up. You’ll grow up without making any effort at all. And at the moment you need to be thinking about other things, my dear little 
girl.”</p><p>“About what, Granddad? About what?”</p><p>“You lie down on my lap, Anastochka, and I’ll sing you your favorite song, the one with no words.”</p><p>Anasta laid her head on Wood’s lap, 
blubbered another time or two and, at the very first notes of the familiar tune, drifted off to sleep.</p><p>The next day Anasta ran up to Wood, joyful and excited. Before she’d 
even stopped running, she announced to Wood:</p><p>“He came by my little home. He came by. At first I wanted to hide when I saw him through the window, but then I just sat there, 
quiet as a mouse, so he’d think there wasn’t anyone in the home. Alan walks up to the little home and takes a seat next to the entrance. He takes a seat, Granddad Wood, and 
he says, ‘I know you’re home, Anasta. You’re a very smart little girl, a quick study, and I’ll wait until you become a beautiful girl. Believe me, I’ll wait, but don’t you 
get ahead of yourself any more.’ And I sat there and didn’t say a thing, and I wasn’t at all mad at him any more. I felt like running out and hugging him and even kissing 
him, like a grown-up, on the cheek, but I didn’t do that. I sat there, quiet as a mouse, so as not to get ahead of myself.</p><p>“Alan sat there a while longer near the entrance to 
my little home, then he got up and left. And I ran to see you, Granddad Wood, to tell you about it. And you know what else, Granddad? You know, Alan, when he was sitting 
there at my place, he drew three little flowers on the wall of my little home – one bigger one, another a bit smaller, and a third, tiny-tiny one. I saw them when I ran out. 
They’re very pretty.”</p><p>Wood hugged Anasta and said:</p><p>“Does that mean you’re not wretched any more and woe is no longer you?”</p><p>“Now I’m joyful, and I feel like making something 
unusual and pretty, so everyone will look at it and be happy and say, ‘Very pretty, great, good,’ and so Alan will hear that and be proud of me.”</p><p>“That’s a very correct 
decision that’s come to you, Anastochka. Create beautiful creations in a burst of inspiration. Only in that way can we win the love of humans.”</p><p> <div class=chapter id=1001>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>8. We Have to Think</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Putting an end to his 
reminiscing, Wood turned to his great-granddaughter, who had thought up a new game to play with the mammoth walking at the head of the caravan. He said:</p><p>“Anasta, you’re 
keeping the mammoth in a state of great tension with your playing. Is it really right to treat an inoffensive, kind animal that way?”</p><p>“Actually, Granddad Wood, I’m keeping him 
in a state of pleasant tension. I’m distracting him from sad thoughts. And see, Granddad Wood, I distracted you from your gloomy thinking,” Anasta said, jabbering away.</p><p>“Yes… 
Many people’s thoughts are gloomy right now. There’s a reason they’ve come up. But what about you, Anastochka, can it be that you don’t have any sad thoughts?”</p><p>“I don’t, 
Granddad Wood.”</p><p>“Does that mean you don’t understand why the adults of our family line are gloomy?”</p><p>“I do understand, Granddad Wood. They’re gloomy because the cold glacier is 
advancing. Many plants are dying from the cold. The people from various settlements have had to leave their family spaces8. And no one knows where they’ll have to go and how 
long they’ll have to walk.”</p><p>“That’s correct…” Wood said pensively. And, somewhat astonished, he asked his great-granddaughter, “But, what, aren’t you sad to take leave of our 
family space, Anastochka?”</p><p>“I’m not sad, Granddad Wood. As soon as that sad, leave-taking thought came up, I immediately rejected it, and now I don’t have it in me any more,” 
Anasta said, jabbering away again light-heartedly and bobbing up and down on the mammoth’s trunk. It was as if the mammoth walking alongside Wood understood he needed to 
carry the little girl alongside her great-grandfather and give them the chance to spend time with each other.</p><p>Wood was both astonished and intrigued by his great-
granddaughter’s answer. What mysterious method she had managed to use to cope with the sad thoughts? And he asked:</p><p>“Anastochka, can you tell me how you managed to reject the 
sad thoughts, what method you used?”</p><p>“A very simple method, Granddad Wood. I decided to remain with my family space.”</p><p>“Remain? You decided to? But you didn’t remain. After all, 
you’re leaving it behind, along with everyone, Anastochka.”</p><p>“For the moment, I happen to be leaving it behind. I’m accompanying everyone on their journey to a far-off land. 
But as soon as we come up onto that rise, the one you can see in the distance, it will be noon, and I’ll need to be heading off back. I’ll be back on my motherland by 
evening. The morning will dawn and it will rejoice at seeing me. I’m already rejoicing right now myself. I can just imagine how much my motherland will rejoice at seeing 
me.”</p><p>Wood didn’t respond to his great-granddaughter’s words with alarm. He figured she had been joking or was just imagining going back in order to drive the sad thoughts off. 
Deciding to play along with the nimble-witted little girl, he said:</p><p>“Yes, the entire space will rejoice at seeing you, but what will you do there all alone?”</p><p>“First of all, 
I’ll make up a hill of dirt and grass around my flower bed,” Anasta replied, jabbering away, “and the little hill won’t allow the cold glacier wind to blow on my beloved 
little flower. I need to be right alongside that little flower when it blossoms. If nobody’s there next to it, the little flower will get very sad.</p><p>“‘What did I bloom for?’ it 
will think. ‘What for, if no one is going to rejoice at my beauty?’ But I’ll be right there and I’ll rejoice.”</p><p>“The little flower will stop blooming, Anastochka and there will 
cold spells, the like of which we’ve never before seen. Many plants won’t be able to bloom in the cold. A huge glacier is advancing upon our family space,” Wood said, as if 
musing to himself as he ascended the rise Anasta had mentioned. “Yes, a glacier is advancing.”</p><p>“I’ll stop the glacier, Granddad Wood,” the little girl suddenly blurted out, 
jumping off the mammoth’s trunk and enthusiastically jabbering on. “I still don’t know how, but I’ll definitely stop it. Something there, on my motherland, will give me a 
hint about how to stop it. I feel it. I feel it ever so strongly. Something will give me a hint, and I’ll be able to do it.</p><p>“There’s a hint, there, on my motherland. It’s 
there, but everyone has left. No one thought of the hint. And no there’s no one the hint can hint to. Everyone thought about how to leave, where to go to get away from the 
cold. But no one wanted to give it some thought together with the hint and think about how to push the glacier aside. And you yourself said it so often at our gatherings, 
Granddad Wood, that we have to think.”</p><p> </p><p>Wood froze in his tracks. The caravan leader stood still, too, and the others who had been following behind the mammoth also stopped.</p><p>The 
gray-haired head of the family line looked intently at his great-granddaughter, saying nothing.</p><p>What Wood did a minute later – he was never able to explain that later, not to 
himself, and certainly not to the others. He signaled to the people who were walking along the sides of the mammoth caravan to keep moving forward. But to Anasta he said:</p><p>“The 
last one in the caravan is a mammoth that’s limping, the son of the caravan leader. You know him, and he obeys you better than all the others. Take him with you, Anasta, and 
when it gets very cold, you can follow in our tracks on him and catch up to us.”</p><p>“Thank you, Granddad Wood,” the little girl cried joyfully. She grabbed him around the legs, 
snuggling up against him. “Thank you!”</p><p>“How am I supposed to tell your mama and papa, your parents, what you’re up to?”</p><p>“I’ll let them know myself once I get back home. There’s 
no need to say anything right now. Goodbye, Granddad Wood.”</p><p> </p><p>Anasta skipped along off to the last mammoth at the end of the caravan, and Wood followed his great-granddaughter’s 
receding figure with his glance, as if what was happening hadn’t quite sunk in yet. He continued on his path, and for some time there were no thoughts at all in his head. 
Only a few hours later did Wood ask himself, “Why did I give my consent? ‘We have to think.’ ‘No one thought about how to stop it.’ No one. She was the only one. Then he 
said, out loud now, “I did the right thing.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1009>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>9. Dun the Mammoth</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div> </p><p>The huge mammoth Dun9 was walking at the end of the caravan, limping slightly. In his build and his strength, He resembled 
his father, the leader of the mammoths.</p><p>When he was still just a young little mammoth, a boulder fell from the mountain and fractured his leg. The people tied sticks to the 
animal’s leg with ropes so the bone would knit properly. Dun had to spend many days lying on his own. It was at that point that a touching friendship started up between the 
mammoth, three-year-old Anasta and the kitten the little girl would bring along with her.</p><p>Little Anasta would often visit the mammoth as he lay there with the bandaged leg and 
bring him treats and talk to him tenderly. She’d taught the kitten to chase annoying bugs and flies away from the mammoth lying on the grass, and she’d place the kitten on 
his hip.</p><p>But the main thing she did was to talk to the two of them and instruct them, the way grown-ups instruct their children.</p><p>After she’d seated the kitten atop the mammoth, 
Anasta would stand before them and point at the sky with her finger, direct her gaze upward and utter the words “sky,” “clouds” and “sun,” and then she’d kneel down and 
stroke the grass with her hand and tenderly utter the words “the nice green grass” and “the little flower has a scent.”</p><p>The mammoth and the kitten would intently watch what 
the little girl did, and after a few days, during which she would regularly repeat her lessons, something astonishing happened. When Anasta uttered the words “sky” and 
“clouds,” the baby mammoth – and then the kitten, too – directed their eyes toward the sky. Upon hearing the word “grass,” they glanced at the grass. And upon hearing the 
words “the little flower has a scent,” the kitten hopped to the ground and began sniffing the little flower, the way the little girl had done.</p><p>Anasta continued her lessons 
with the animals even after the mammoth had recovered. The little girl liked telling her four-legged friends about the meaning of each new word she learned from the grown-
ups. And the young mammoth and the kitten liked the attention the kind little girl gave them. Like well-disciplined pupils, they would come to Anasta’s flower bed at noon. 
The little girl would usually show up at that time, too, and she’d give her charges their next lesson. If she didn’t show up for some reason, the four-legged pupils would sit 
waiting for their friend and teacher for hours at a time or else head off to look for her.</p><p>When Anasta turned six, Dun the mammoth, who’d also gotten bigger, was pretty much 
the same as the grown-ups on the outside, but his behavior differed noticeably from the other mammoths’.</p><p>Wood, Anasta’s great-grandfather and the head of the family line, was 
the first to notice that Dun the mammoth could understand human speech. It was the following event that preceded his conclusion.</p><p>Wood was sitting in the shade of a broad tree 
and weaving a wicker basket for berries. Anasta would often spend time with her great-grandfather. She liked to listen to his stories and be part of all he did, and so she 
was right alongside him this time, too. His chatty great-granddaughter was quickly and animatedly telling him her thoughts on collecting berries, and she told him he had to 
make the basket pretty, because then the berries collected in it would be tasty.</p><p>Right then Wood noticed that Dun the mammoth, who was standing ten steps away from them, was 
looking intently at Anasta and listening to what she was saying, as if he understood the meaning of the words and the sense of his great-granddaughter’s speech. “He must like 
the intonation of the little girl’s voice and the energy coming from her,” Wood thought. Noticing that there was almost no water left in the trough where the twigs for 
weaving the basket were soaking, Wood asked Anasta to fetch a little water from the nearby spring. But his ever-obedient and diligent great-granddaughter didn’t rush to 
fulfill Wood’s request. She just turned in the mammoth’s direction and quickly told him, “Dun, fetch a little water from the spring.” And then, as if nothing out of the 
ordinary had happened, she continued her animated story about the berries and the basket.</p><p>The mammoth slowly turned around and steadily took one step and then another in the 
direction of the spring. Then Anasta said one more phrase. “Get a move on, Dun.” And the huge mammoth began to run.</p><p>Wood understood that unlike the other mammoths, Dun wasn’t 
simply carrying out certain commands. Rather, he could understand human speech far better than the other animals – he understood the meaning of the words and, what’s more, he 
understood the meaning of whole sentences.</p><p>The mammoth brought a little water in his trunk and, at the little girl’s direction, emptied it into the trough with the twigs.</p><p>“Thank you,” Anasta said, praising the mammoth, and she added, “Don’t forget to water our flower garden this evening. But for now, go to the woods and have some lunch. You 
can see I’m busy.” The mammoth answered the little girl with a nod of his head and headed for the woods.</p><p>“What are the limits of the animal kingdom’s ability to serve man?” 
Wood thought. “To what extent can man direct it? Now, people thought up the wheel and everyone was so delighted by the invention and began looking for different ways of using 
it. But living creatures, who have already been thought up and are far more advanced than the wheel – we’ve stopped studying them entirely. Is our race doing the right thing? 
Where might man’s ignorance of the capabilities and life’s purpose of the varied nature around him lead?”</p><p>That’s what Wood was reflecting on, and these thoughts made his heart 
uneasy.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1010>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>10. Don't Surrender, Motherland! I'm with You!</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************

trunk out toward the little girl and lightly touched the little girl’s shoulder with its tip. She took hold of the tip of the trunk, pressed her cheek to it and tenderly 
stroked it. Then she gave the order, “Follow me!” and ran hopping off back in the direction of the family space they had left.</p><p>The mammoth hastily turned around and ran after 
Anasta. When Anasta grew tired, she gestured to the mammoth to stop and scrambled up his trunk and onto his head. When she’d made her way up onto Dan’s back, she saw the 
kitten there, too. He had long since grown into an adult cat, but had still retained his nickname of “Kitten.” He started rubbing against the little girl’s leg and purring, 
expressing his joy and devotion.</p><p>The three of them made their way to the abandoned family space by late evening. Anasta sent Dun off to pasture, went into her little clay 
house, made her way in the darkness to her sleeping spot with the aromatic hay, lay down on it and immediately fell asleep.</p><p>Anasta was up with the dawn. She ran out of her 
little home and, blinking and spreading her arms wide, she offered her body up to the tender, warm rays. After taking this sunbath, the little girl ran to the stream and, 
taking a running jump, went with a splash into the little creek with its clear water.</p><p>The cold spring water burned Anasta’s body, but she splashed and laughed in delight. 
Then, after making her way out of the water, hopping and spinning around on the shore, as if she had no idea where to go and how to use the unusual energy that had filled 
her, she ran up onto a small hill.</p><p>A cold wind was blowing. The little girl tied her shawl around her waist and threw its free end over her shoulder. She looked silently at 
the land where her family line had lived so very recently.</p><p>The family space, where once the sounds of the voices of a great many birds and the chirping and buzzing of insects 
had unceasingly been heard, was now keeping some kind of fateful silence. Here and there the grass shone white from the chill of the night. The trees and bushes in the 
gardens weren’t blooming. Their little leaves were curled, as if in despair.</p><p>And the family space, shrouded in the oppressive silence, with its withering but still living 
natural diversity, attended to the little girl with incomprehension. And all of a sudden, everything all around shuddered, when… A cry of desperate and confident joy pierced 
the oppressive silence like a warm ray of light:</p><p>“He-e-ey! He-e-e-ey!” Anasta shouted, in defiance of the oppressive silence. “Don’t surrender, Motherland! I am Anasta, 
Motherland. I am with you.”</p><p>She ran down from the hill and dashed to her flower bed, touching the tree trunks with her hands as she ran and stroking the little leaves of the 
bushes.</p><p>“He-e-ey!” she cried out once more, running around the trunk of a big, old apple tree with shriveled leaves.</p><p>The little girl’s thin, high and joyful little voice was 
conquering the silence that had been oppressing the family space. And suddenly another voice joined hers, a powerful, low bass – Dun the mammoth was running from the pasture 
at Anasta’s cry. Running and trumpeting for all he was worth as he went.</p><p>And next to the little girl you could also hear a loud, incessant “Meow, meow” – it was the cat with 
the nickname “Kitten,” meowing in support of Anasta.</p><p>Anasta stopped at the flower bed that she herself tended, the way all the children in the settlement each tended their own 
flower beds.</p><p>The grass on one edge of the flower bed had turned gray, and the flowers had dropped, and only one still unopened bud remained on the little girl’s favorite 
flower. It was drooping toward the ground as if it had thought the better of blooming. But the sight of the drooping bud didn’t make the little girl sad. She was looking at 
it and smiling. She wasn’t sad, because she was imagining her favorite flower not drooping, but abloom in all its beauty.</p><p>Squatting down before the flower that had been 
getting ready to wilt, she quietly and tenderly called out to it:</p><p>“Hey, little flower, I’m here. Wake up.”</p><p>Then she held her index finger in her mouth, then raised it, to 
determine from which side the cold wind was blowing on the flower. Having determined the direction of the flow of glacial air, she lay down on her side on that side of the 
flower, in an attempt to block the path of the cold air with her own body. Even so, the cold currents still enveloped the flower’s small body and stung its little leaves, 
preventing them from straightening up. Suddenly the cold streams of air stopped and Anasta felt the opposite – she felt warmth on her back. She turned – Dun the mammoth had 
flopped down on his side and shielded Anasta and her entire flower bed from the cold with with his own body.</p><p>“Good for you, Dun! You smart thing!” Anasta exclaimed.</p><p>Latching 
onto his fur, she scrambled up onto the mammoth’s back and, turning to face the wind that was blowing from the direction of the glacier, she joyfully and victoriously shouted 
out her “He-e-ey!” The cold wind blew even more strongly. Then, after thinking a bit, the little girl turned in the opposite direction and shouted out a summons and waved her 
arms, as if inviting someone invisible to come. The mammoth raised his trunk up high and trumpeted a summons, too. Kitten began meowing, calling.</p><p>The cold wind quieted down, 
but some time later it started up again, only now it was blowing from the other side, and it was caressing the flower and the mammoth and the little girl and the cat standing 
on his back with warm currents.</p><p>The singing of the few remaining birds greeted the life-giving streams of air.</p><p>For several days, Anasta fought against the cold wind blowing 
from the direction of the glacier; again and again, she would run to her flower as soon as the wind started up. And each time, the mammoth would lie down next to the flower 
bed, as had become his habit, blocking the cold’s path.</p><p>Then the day came when the rejuvenated flower bloomed. Running up to the mound of earth, Anasta got down on her knees 
before the flower and kissed the orangey-red petals, touching them lightly with her lips. Then she took two steps to the side and admired the beautiful miracle and the 
extraordinary, beautiful creation – her flower.</p><p>Since she couldn’t stay standing in one spot, due to the exuberant energy that had surged up from somewhere inside her, Anasta 
at first hopped up and down in place, and then her hops morphed into an unusual, improvised and rousing dance. Even Dun the mammoth was trying to dance along, shifting from 
one leg to another. Kitten was spinning around, now flopping down on his back, now jumping up again. And the living flower was waving its orangey-red petals at them in the 
warm breeze.</p><p>And then Anasta stopped. She’d caught sight of two youths standing on the mountain.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1011>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>11. 
The Brothers Opposite</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br><img src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/brothers-opposite-vk.com-kumar82.jpg></div></p><p> </p><p>Both youths were of the same height and athletic build. In outward appearance, 
they looked a great deal like each other, differing only in the color of their hair and eyes. One was Light-haired and Blue-eyed, the other Black-eyed and Dark-haired.</p><p>The 
youths stayed where they were for a while, as if giving Anasta the chance to get used to their unexpected appearance. Then, at a leisurely pace, they approached the little 
girl.</p><p>“Hello, little girl!” Dark-haired said, addressing her. “You need to act more quickly, little girl. You sensed intuitively that you will be able to stop the glacier, 
that you have within you powers capable of changing God’s program. Now, that’s impossible, of course. But you will continue seeking these powers within you. And I will learn 
more about Man than I currently know. I’m prepared to tell you about the world order and answer any question you might have, little girl. Only you need to act as fast as you 
can.”</p><p>Anasta had no time to answer: the second youth began to speak:</p><p>“Hello, Anasta. You’re pretty and sharp, you’re splendid, just like many other marvelous creations on the 
great planet Earth. My brother knows much about the world order, but you should, I think, listen to yourself above all others.”</p><p>Anasta finally managed to greet the youths: “A 
good day and good, light thoughts to you.”</p><p>“Hold on,” Dark-haired said, interrupting Anasta. “That’s just the way it always is. It even makes me sick to hear those idiotic, 
thoughtless memorized words. There are two of us here. I’m dark, so why do people wish me light thoughts?</p><p>“I’m dark, and my thoughts are dark and hostile. That’s the way I am, 
and that’s my life’s purpose within God’s program!” Dark-haired was growing more and more angry. “If I’m some kind of light little sniveling fool, a light thinker, then I 
won’t be me. Poof – and there won’t be anything left of me. You get it, little girl? All that will be left in front of you is one light little simpleton. There are two of us! 
You get it, little girl? And you shouldn’t only speak about what’s light. Take your thoughts back, if that’s what was behind your words, if your words weren’t just memorized 
parrot sounds.”</p><p>“If my greeting has offended you, then I will change it and will say to you a simple, ‘Hello,’” Anasta replied.</p><p>“Now, that’s more like it. ‘Cause otherwise, you 
and your light…”</p><p>“Who are you?” Anasta inquired. “What family line are you from? I’ve never seen you before.”</p><p>“Of course, you haven’t. No one has ever seen us. But our 
manifestations are present in all human doings, in every moment,” the dark youth told her quickly. “Yes, in each and every one. Now, of course, there are more of my 
manifestations – they are awesome. Almost all of humanity lives from disaster to disaster, dominated by my energies.”</p><p>“Stop, my dark and talented brother,” said the light-
haired one. “After all, we didn’t even introduce ourselves.” And, turning to the little girl, he went on: “Anastochka, try to understand what I say. Between the two of us, my 
brother and I make up the two complexes of Universal energies. The entire immense space of the Universe is filled with energy entities. When God created Man, He took an equal 
amount of energy from each of the entities, brought them into inner balance in some unknown way, and gave them to the person He had created. Out of everything, He created a 
person with inner balance.</p><p>“When this happened, we all understood that Man must emerge as the strongest entity in the Universe. That’s why he’s not called an entity, but Man. 
But where his strength lies, what his capabilities are and whether they are limited – that is unknown. And when it, this strength, will fully manifest – this has, up to the 
present day, been known to no one in the entire Universe. Not even to us, despite the fact that we and our separate energies are present everywhere. We are always invisible. 
We always fill up space. We’re present in the water, and in every living wild animal and every little worm. And the energies of the Universe – each and every one of them – 
exist within each person.”</p><p>“You say you’re invisible,” Anasta said, astonished, “but you know, I can see you!”</p><p>“Yes, you see us, because we solidified the air, solidified it so 
as to exhibit the kind of bodies you’re used to. The clouds up there in the sky, for example – you know they’re solidified air vapors, too. You get whimsical shapes when they 
solidify: sometimes you get ones that look like wild animals, sometimes ones that look like a human face or body. And in many ways the human body is made up of water that’s 
been solidified to different degrees. It must be the case that the Creator alone knows the meaning and ratios of the various solidifications of the human body. Our bodies 
resemble human bodies only on the outside. My dark-haired brother represents all the dark entities, while I represent all the light ones.”</p><p>“But why did you exhibit this 
solidification in the form of the human body?” Anasta asked.</p><p>“So you wouldn’t be frightened when you heard our voices, so you wouldn’t expend the energy of your thoughts on 
trying to guess where the sound was coming from,” Light-haired answered.</p><p>“But what did you want to talk with me for?”</p><p>“You set out in defiance of the elements, or, to be more 
precise, in opposition to a planetary disaster. You set out on your own, confident that you’d be able to prevent it. We are certain that this is impossible to do. God’s 
program includes provisions for a disaster, should mankind follow a ruinous path. That has happened, more than once. And we wouldn’t have paid any attention to your efforts. 
It’s just that all the Universal entities shuddered when the flower on your mound of earth bloomed. It bloomed, even though according to the Creator’s program, it should have 
died. But it bloomed.”</p><p>“The flower bloomed thanks to the mammoth who shielded it from the cold breeze.”</p><p>“The mammoth is but one link in the chain of events that you 
constructed.”</p><p>“I didn’t construct anything.”</p><p>“Your thought did the constructing, Anastochka.”</p><p>“So does that mean your particles are inside me, too?” Anasta asked thoughtfully. 
“But I can’t feel them at all.”</p><p>“A person doesn’t feel us, especially when he manages to balance our particles within him. When they are in balance, a third energy appears. 
And this third is found solely in the Universal entity that is Man. It appears when we are in complete balance and it, this new energy, is all-powerful. It’s capable of 
creating new worlds. No secrets exist for it. This kind of person becomes a master of the Universe, a creator, and no one can even imagine his creations. They can be 
magnificent and unfathomable.”</p><p>“Your particles are probably not at all balanced in me, since I can’t stop the glacier,” Anasta said with a sigh. “The flower bloomed, but 
everything around it in our family space is withering and dying.”</p><p>“Anastochka, you are on the path to unity. You can attain it in the next moment or in three millennia. It’s 
for this reason that the Universal energies will strive to help you, so that they can learn Man’s great secret and their own future fate as well.”</p><p>“What you said about the 
extraordinary power hidden in the unity of the opposites is so interesting. But if you know about this extraordinary power, why don’t the two of you just agree to unite?”</p><p>The 
two brothers exchanged glances and cast their gaze over Anasta’s family space. Then they began looking in different directions. They were slow to answer, as if at that moment 
they themselves were looking for the right words to explain it. The little girl waited patiently.</p><p>Finally Light-haired answered.</p><p> <div class=chapter id=1012>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>12. What is your Life's Program?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“That’s 
impossible. My brother and I have different tasks,” Light-haired said. “Everybody has his own program. And nonetheless, only in Man can we, by each carrying out our personal 
program, also work on the overall plan and become particles of the new energy that’s found only in Man.”</p><p>“But how in the world can you each work on something different, 
something opposite, and at the same time contribute to the overall good?” Anasta inquired incredulously.</p><p>“We can, by continually outpacing each other by just a little bit. 
When you start walking, Anastushka, one of your little legs shoots out ahead, leaving the other behind. Then the one that’s lagged behind suddenly shoots out ahead. It’s like 
the legs are competing against each other. And in the end, together, by complying with the body’s thoughts, they move it forward.”</p><p>Dark-haired entered the conversation: “Now 
that’s some example you gave. You even cracked me up,” he said, interrupting his brother. “If you’re going to imagine us as two little legs, then you’re a really short one, 
and I’m super long. I take a step, and the body goes right up over mountains, but you just loaf around, pretending to move. I’m leading mankind to a planetary disaster for 
the fifth time now, as part of carrying out my own program. And if the Creator’s thought regenerates it all over again, it doesn’t matter – Bam! I’ll hit it all over again 
with a planetary disaster, so it won’t get out of line.”</p><p>“Yes, you’re talented, my dear brother. You really have led the life of the whole planet to the brink of a global 
disaster. But your disasters don’t bring you any discoveries, any new knowledge, and they don’t add to your powers. But they do always give Man new knowledge. And mankind 
regenerates all over again.”</p><p>“But before they do, they perish in hellish agony, along with all their knowledge.”</p><p>“You and I, Brother, we don’t know the Creator’s program. 
Perhaps one day it will happen that mankind will prevent a disaster – an instant before it happens – and at that point an aspiration unknown to you and me will illuminate its 
thought.”</p><p>“I’m sick of your light little dreamiekinses, my light little snotty-nosed brother. You listen to me, little girl, not him,” the dark-haired youth said, addressing 
Anasta. “I, little girl, will show you all my power in a form you can understand. My light little one there got a thing or two right. Human thought really is a huge energy, 
equal to mine in size, and way bigger than his. Each person, if he makes use of this energy properly, really is capable of making the world different.</p><p>“But there’s another 
unseen energy-thought, too – collective thought. That’s when a great many of separate people’s thoughts come together into a unified whole. If all mankind’s thoughts came 
together into a unified whole and you got a mankind-wide thought – my brother and I would be like ants compared to it.</p><p>“But I’ve learned how to prevent collective thought from 
arising. I’m the one who tosses various philosophical lines of reasoning and concepts out to mankind. And what you end up with is one billion people collectively thinking one 
way, and another billion thinking a different way, and that way they repudiate the first group. I, little girl, am the incarnation of all the dark powers of the Universe, and 
if you join forces with me, we will become a force second to none. I have a secret plan. You’ll get what it’s all about, and you’ll help me.</p><p>“Together we’ll turn all people 
into our playthings. We’ll play with their minds. I’ll make you mankind’s mistress, and one day you will tell me…”</p><p>“I don’t like that plan,” Anasta replied, and added, “I will 
never take part in it, and I don’t think any other people would agree, either.”</p><p>“You won’t take part? You, little girl, just don’t know yet, what an amusing game it is – 
making people think what you want them to.</p><p>“And don’t be so quick to say that people won’t follow my program. The wheel has already been invented – it’s primitive, so far, but 
then people will put two wooden wheels together with a pole, and that’s in line with my plan, my ingenious program.”</p><p>“But what’s so bad about a wheel? When we had to haul food 
to the injured mammoth Dun, a little wheeled cart helped us do that.”</p><p>“It’s all good, little girl. Just great, even. This wheel will be perfected. A great many wheels will be 
made. And people will see that it’s difficult to roll a wheel over the natural terrain, across hillocks and pot holes, through tall grass. And then they’ll cover a huge 
portion of the earth over with a stone shell, so the wheels will be able to roll along it unobstructed.</p><p>“And, growing more and more numerous, they will roll along over the 
groaning earth, carrying some people atop them and ruthlessly crushing others beneath them.</p><p>“You, little girl – try to find an answer yourself: what can be more powerful than 
the power which can send people to their ruin? But you won’t be able to find an answer within you, so go ahead and acknowledge my greatness.”</p><p>Anasta pondered the question, but 
couldn’t find an answer within her. She looked once more at the light-haired youth. In response to the little girl’s silent question, Light-haired replied:</p><p>“Anastochka, my 
brother has painted a sad picture for you. That’s his task, and he’s carrying it out in good conscience. I can see the question in your eyes: do I have a program, too? I do, 
and I also want to appeal to you to take part in my program.”</p><p>“So what does your program want?”</p><p>“To try to comprehend the Creator’s great creation: Man. To understand the 
greatness of His future achievements.”</p><p>“But hasn’t everything on Earth already been created?” Anasta asked, astonished.</p><p>“The fact of the matter is, Anastochka… You see before 
you a beautiful blooming flower. Each plant or animal is perfected in and of itself, but at the same time they are all interconnected, too. It seems that the Creator has 
created a miraculous, harmonious and perfected earthly world. But that doesn’t mean that this world can’t be perfected even more.</p><p>“We can view the Creator’s creations as 
simply the rough material for a more perfected creation: for creating a beautiful and perfected way of life never before seen or imagined by anyone.”</p><p>“But who can be more 
perfect than perfection itself?” Anasta asked in amazement.</p><p>“Those who issue forth from it: the Great parent’s son and daughter. For example, you, Anastochka.”</p><p>“Me? But I can’t 
imagine how you could possibly alter what’s already been created. I, for example, have no desire whatsoever to alter the little flower that bloomed in my flower bed, even the 
tiniest bit. I even think that we shouldn’t alter it, not under any circumstances, so that we don’t spoil its perfection. And why alter Kitten? Or how could you perfect, say, 
Dun the mammoth? By altering his trunk, or his ears? By altering it how? And what for?”</p><p>“But see here, Anastochka, you altered Dun the mammoth.”</p><p>“No, I never altered him,” she 
objected in amazement.</p><p>“It’s true – you didn’t alter him on the outside, but your mammoth Dun carries out far more human instructions than all the other mammoths who have ever 
lived on Earth, and Dun’s understanding of what he’s instructed to do is qualitatively different. You’ll see that immediately if you compare him with your other mammoths, the 
ones that look similar.”</p><p>“Yes, now I get it. I think he’s smarter than all the other ones. It’s just that before, I somehow didn’t give it any thought.”</p><p>“There, you see? Not 
only the external form and build are significant. What’s inside and the life’s purpose are more important. And you were the very one who created and determined what’s inside 
of Dun, and a life’s purpose for him. And Dun the mammoth, who on the outside doesn’t look at all different from other mammoths created by the great Creator, is different 
nonetheless. Now he is a joint creation – the Creator’s and yours. And we don’t know who he belongs more to. After all, it isn’t only that Dun the mammoth can carry out a 
larger number of commands that are essential in every day human life. He’s grown more intelligent, loyal and responsive. Do you recall how one day you fell asleep on the dry 
grass beneath a tall, tall tree, and when you woke up, you saw Dun the mammoth standing above you, not moving a muscle? You got angry – there was some really unpleasant smell 
coming from him, as if he’d gotten smeared with some foul thing and had come on purpose to disturb your sleep with this unpleasant smell. You got up and set off walking 
toward your home across the wet grass, but before you did, you said to Dun the mammoth in a dissatisfied tone, ‘Dun, you’re forever straggling off from the herd. Now you’ve 
started coming here of your own accord, even when no one’s calling you. Go on off to your pasture, to your brothers.’</p><p>“You went away, walking barefoot through the wet grass, 
without looking back even once. Anastochka, do you remember that the grass was wet?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And do you know why Dun the mammoth smelled so unpleasant?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“When you fell 
asleep, a thunderstorm began. Not only people, but animals, too, know that lightning most often strikes tall trees. Dun saw you fall asleep, and when the thunderstorm began, 
he got all agitated and came over to you, leaving his herd. He didn’t wake you up. He just stood over you, shielding you from the rain. Some lightning hit the tree you were 
sleeping under. One branch caught fire and began to fall. It would have fallen on you, but Dun the mammoth managed to cast it aside with his trunk. Then a second branch 
caught fire, and Dun cast that one off, too, but not before the fire had scorched the fur on the mammoth’s head, and it began to smolder, giving off an unpleasant smell. The 
scorched spot was unbearably painful, but Dun stood above you without moving a muscle, while you slept. And when you left after rebuking him for being a pest, he couldn’t 
even bring himself to take offense, and he forgot about the pain. He was overjoyed that you hadn’t been harmed, and later, when tending to his burn, he thought of you with 
tenderness.”</p><p>Anasta jumped to her feet and ran to the mammoth, who was standing a short distance away. He nodded joyfully. Anasta took hold of the tip of his trunk, patted it 
with her hand, pressed her cheek to it then kissed it. The mammoth froze. He kept standing that way, motionlessly, his eyes scrunched up, even after the little girl had 
walked away from him and gone back to the light-haired youth.</p><p>“I get it,” Anasta said to Light-haired. “Dun the mammoth has been remodeled. Maybe it happened all on its own, 
or maybe I helped him in some way. He does differ from the mammoths who were just created by the Creator.</p><p>“Does that mean Man’s been given that right – the right to remodel?”</p><p>“Yes, he’s been given that,” Light-haired answered. “So now think about this: in accordance with which program?”</p><p>“In accordance with the good one.”</p><p>“So go ahead and define it. 
Choose. Create.”</p><p>“Do you mean that the One who created everything on Earth didn’t create any one program that Man has to live by?”</p><p>“I think that He presented Man with a great 
many options to choose from, but that He himself dreamt only of one thing.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Only Man can find an answer to that.”</p><p>“But where should we look for it?”</p><p>“Inside you. By 
mentally imagining, analyzing and comparing various options for arranging life on Earth.”</p><p>“Do you mean people live on Earth, but know nothing of the Creator’s program?”</p><p>“People 
have been given great knowledge about using biological resources for development, but people possess various types of freedom, including the freedom to replace biological 
resources with technocratic ones. It’s up to them to decide whether to use their inner resources deep down inside them – those, say, of a living tree that grows and senses 
biological rhythms and, by adjusting to them, regulates its own state depending on the surrounding conditions – or the exterior, superficial resources of a dead tree. When 
people step onto the technocratic path of development, they use the superficial resources – they fashion this or that implement out of wood and use it for fuel or for 
building material.</p><p>“For some reason, people always choose the technocratic path. But it inevitably leads them to disaster. That’s happened more than once. After all, all 
planetary disasters are created by people’s thoughts. Thoughts that are followed by actions.”</p><p>“But the glacier that forced my family line to leave its home – no people created 
that.”</p><p>“Your family line, Anastochka, has already set foot on the technocratic path. And in accordance with the program of life, the glacier will overtake it and bring it to 
ruin. But life will rise anew. A new hope for human intelligence will appear. If someone stops the glacier, and only a person can do that, your family line will live in a 
technocratic world. And sooner or later the technocratic path will all the same lead it to disaster. True, if a person finds a way to stop the glacier – meaning, a way to 
avert one disaster – then in all likelihood, he’ll be able to avert the one after it, too. A short while before the next one, he’ll be able to illuminate people’s souls with 
an understanding of where they went wrong in their choices, and avert the disaster. Then mankind will be able to choose a new path and gradually and carefully dismantle his 
lethal inventions. But illuminating the souls of people of the technocratic world is an uphill battle.</p><p>“During a technocratic period of life, people cease to be intelligent 
beings. It’s necessary to appeal not to their minds, but to their feelings and, through their feelings, to inform them about the essence of the Divine program, and in order 
to do this, one has to sense and comprehend it for oneself.”</p><p>“But haven’t you already comprehended it?”</p><p>“Not entirely. Really, I think it’s impossible to completely grasp it in 
the way that one can completely comprehend my brother’s programs. It’s impossible to completely comprehend it. Completion is cessation of motion. In addition, I see no limit 
to how much you can perfect, say, your mammoth.”</p><p>“What about other wild animals?”</p><p>“Others, too. You know full well, Anastochka, that all animal offspring adopt their parents’ 
habits and skills. That means that each new generation will be a bit more perfected than the previous one, and if Man correctly determines all wild animals’ life purposes, if 
each subsequent generation continues perfecting the animal world around it – a world that will free man from all every day concerns – then in the very same way, human thought 
will be freed up for more important achievements.”</p><p>“That probably is what can happen, if you’re speaking about wild animals. But now, I wouldn’t ever take it into my head to 
try to perfect the little flower – it’s very, very perfected.”</p><p>“I think so, too, Anastochka. Even so, your beautiful little flower is but the paint that the Creator has 
presented to his daughter for her future creations.”</p><p>“But why paint? After all, the little flower is a living thing.”</p><p>“Yes, certainly, it’s a living thing and self-contained, 
and at the same time it can be no more than a tiny particle of the living picture that is great in its beauty.</p><p>“Take a look at your flower bed. What looks most beautiful in it 
is your favorite flower. But if you plant two or three more of the very same flower in it, the way the flower bed looks will change. Then you can plant other pretty flowers, 
ones that don’t look like these, and the way the flower bed looks will change once again.</p><p>“Then you can perfect the living picture by arranging the various flowers in a 
different order. There’s no limit to the perfection. It is in accordance with the Creator’s program to move toward it.”</p><p>“Does that mean that Man was created in order to make 
everything around him lovelier and lovelier? In order to perfect the world the Creator gave him? Is that Man’s main life’s purpose?”</p><p>“To create glorious living pictures, to 
comprehend and perfect the animal world – of course, that is an important life’s purpose for Man. But I see the main one as something different.”</p><p>“As what?”</p><p>“As Man perfects 
the Divine world order, he himself will necessarily become more and more perfected, and there is no limit to be seen to this phenomenon. Great resources will open up before 
him.”</p><p>“But why will he be more perfected? I mean, no one’s going to be instructing Man while all this is going on.”</p><p>“You, Anastochka, created a lovely flower bed and your 
experience helped you understand how to do that. You’ll try to make your creation next year even better. And you’ll do so, using your previous experience and feelings. That 
means that by creating the first time, you gained experience, knowledge and sensations that enable you to create something more perfected. And that means that your creation 
itself is instructing you.</p><p>“Creation in divine, living nature perfects the creator.</p><p>“And there is no end in sight to the heights such great creation can reach– there is 
eternity.”</p><p>“I really want to live in a marvelous world like that, where everything can be perfected eternally, where the creator will perfect his creations and the creations 
will perfect their creator. I want my papa and mama, my brothers and Grandfather Wood and our entire family line to live in that world.” Anasta smiled, and her eyes shone. “I 
must stop the glacier. How do I do it? How?”</p><p>“Human thought is the most powerful energy of the Universe. There is no limit to its potential. It’s important to learn to use it 
properly. But how to do this, using what means – that is unknown. Only Man has the power to make this great discovery.”</p><p>“Most likely, my thought is still quite small and not 
powerful,” Anasta said sadly, sighing. “I want the glacier to stop, but it’s coming closer and closer, and it’s growing colder and colder every day. That means my thought is 
small.</p><p>“If Dun the mammoth knew how to think about the glacier… He has a big head, and that means the thought in it might be big and powerful.”</p><p>Anasta ran up to the mammoth 
and, slapping her palm against the trunk he extended to her in greeting, she said, excited:</p><p>“You’re so big, Dun, and you have a big head. That means it might contain a big 
thought. Think your thought, Dun. Stop the glacier. Because otherwise all you do is listen and listen. At the very least, take a walk over to the pasture, Dun – there’s less 
and less food for you all the time there.”</p><p>Dun the mammoth stroked the little girl’s cheek and hair with the tip of his trunk, slowly turned around and began walking off. The 
cat nicknamed Kitten took a running start, sprang onto the mammoth’s leg and, latching onto his fur, scrambled up onto his back.</p><p>“Anastochka, it’s time for you and your 
charges to flee this place,” the light-haired youth said, addressing the little girl. “There’s already ice on the other side of that mountain there. That isn’t even the main 
glacier yet, but even it can move the mountain that covers the valley, and carry away the gardens and homes where your family line lived. And it’s causing the temperature to 
fall with every day. The main glacier will press against this ice and the mountain will slowly begin moving. This will happen a few days from now.”</p><p>“I will not flee this 
place. I have to see it, this ice, and understand why it’s advancing onto our Land. I have to think up a way to stop the glacier. Tomorrow morning I’ll go up on that mountain 
and I’ll see it.”</p><p>Bowing to the little girl and taking his leave of her, the light-haired youth said, “I wish you auspicious and sharp thoughts, Anastochka.” And he addressed 
his brother, saying, “Let us go, Brother, and remove ourselves from the little girl’s sight. Let’s not bother her. Perhaps she’ll be able to understand and will learn how to 
control her thought.”</p><p>“Come on then, let’s go. Of the two of us, you’re the main hindrance. You got all carried away here, philosophizing and going on and on.”</p><p>“Oh, wait! 
Please wait!” Anasta suddenly said, starting. “Each of you told about his program. That means I must also have a program, but I’ve never ever thought about it. Could it be I 
don’t have one in me?”</p><p>“We’re getting out of your sight, little girl. You get busy thinking. Don’t slack off. You’ve hardly got any time at all left, only two sunrises,” said 
Dark-haired, without answering the question.</p><p>And the youths left.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1013>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>13. Who Controls our Thoughts? </h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div> </p><p>Anasta was left totally alone. Slowly, she set off walking along the wilted grass of the valley 
where her family line had so very recently lived, and in the absolute silence that had fallen, she tried to comprehend how she could control her own thought.</p><p>If thought was 
the strongest energy, the little girl reflected, then what could possibly control it, this strongest thing? If this energy-thought exists within me, then what within me could 
be stronger than it? And why did the most wise elders teach us everything at the gatherings, but say nothing about how you can control your thought? Perhaps they didn’t know 
anything about this either?</p><p>The strongest energy remains uncontrolled. First it heads off in one direction, then in another. Even though it’s inside me, all the same it’s also 
not mine, if I don’t control it in any way. And maybe someone will manage to lure it over to them and play with it, and since it’s inside me, then they’re playing some kind 
of game with me, too, but I won’t even know about it.</p><p>All the way up until dusk, Anasta made efforts to reflect on the power of thought. And when she lay down to sleep, she 
made an intense effort to think about it.</p><p>When she woke up in the morning, Anasta did not see Dun the mammoth next to her little home the way she usually did. He used to 
always be right there as soon as she woke up, but now he wasn’t there. Dun still hadn’t shown up by the time Anasta had bathed in the creek, either. She began calling him, 
shouting in the direction of the pasture, “Dun! Dun!” But, just as before, he didn’t show up. Kitten hadn’t been next to her that night, either, and he also didn’t show up in 
the morning.</p><p>Anasta realized they had left. A mammoth needs a lot of vegetation to eat, and there was less and less of it all the time. That meant Dun had left so he wouldn’t 
die a senseless death, from starvation. And Kitten had gone off with him, too. “But I won’t leave,” Anasta thought. Tossing a coverlet woven from grass bast around her little 
shoulders, she resolutely set off for the mountain beyond which the glacier was advancing on the world. Wending her way up the path toward the mountaintop, Anasta once again 
made an intense effort to comprehend how this strongest energy – human thought – worked. What did she need to do in order to stop the glacier?</p><p>When she’d reached the 
mountaintop, she stood on its peak, wrapping herself in her shawl in the wind. Harsh, bitterly cold air currents tousled her hair, now uncovering the star-shaped birthmark on 
her forehead, now covering it over again. But the little girl didn’t notice the cold air currents. She was taking in what was going on down below, on the far side of the 
mountain, whose foothills no longer sported any verdure. From horizon to horizon, as far as the eye could see, there lay ice.</p><p>Blocks of ice were heading for the mountain. They 
were huge, and this wasn’t even the main glacier, but merely the first ice cakes that the more powerful ones were pushing along. That meant the mountain didn’t stand a chance 
against the giant masses, Anasta was thinking.</p><p>One side of the mountain had already grown cold, and there was no vegetation on it, and the second one would grow cold as well. 
As if confirming her words, the sound of cracking ice was heard, and a stream of water mixed with ice chips rushed out from beneath the ice, and the ice blocks traveled along 
the slush, coming closer and closer to the mountain, plowing up the earth before them and pushing along the felled trees.</p><p>Anasta directed her gaze to the tallest block of ice 
and started at what she saw. There stood Dun the mammoth, his head pressed against this giant mountain of ice. Alongside the giant mass of ice, he no longer seemed so big.</p><p>Anasta instantly recalled how attentively Dun had listened to her words about the power of thought that is capable of a great deal. She recalled telling him that probably 
there must be big and powerful thoughts in his big head. And he had understood all of that in his own way. He’d figured that if he were to put his big head with its big 
thought up against the ice block, then he’d be able to stop it from moving.</p><p>Anasta raced from her spot and ran headlong along the path to the foothill of the mountain, to the 
spot where Dun the mammoth was standing.</p><p>The wind, with its biting snowflakes, tore off the little girl’s scarf in a violent gust, but she didn’t pick it up. She jumped 
forward onto a rock, stumbled and rolled down, head over heels. And then she got up once more and set off running.</p><p>When she’d gotten to Dun’s legs, she saw… A small depression 
had formed in the ice, beneath the mammoth’s head. The ice there had melted a tiny bit, and water was running down the mammoth’s trunk in thin streams.</p><p>The mammoth was 
trembling from the cold. And down below, at his feet, Anasta saw that Kitten was trembling from the cold. He, his head pressed against the ice like Dun, was attempting to 
hold back the glacier’s movement.</p><p>“He-e-ey,” Anasta shouted. “He-e-ey!”</p><p>But neither the mammoth nor the cat responded to her shout. The little girl scooped up Kitten, who was 
trembling from the cold, and, cuddling him, began rubbing his little body. When he’d gotten warmed up a little, Anasta made him scramble up on the mammoth’s back. Kitten 
tried with all his strength to do it, but he fell. He was only able to make it up on top on his second attempt.</p><p>Anasta stood up on the rock so she’d be as close as possible to 
the mammoth’s ear, and she whispered to him:</p><p>“Dun! My faithful Dun. You are very smart and loyal. You are kind. You know how to think – maybe not entirely correctly, but we’ll 
fix that. Thought isn’t just in the head – it’s everywhere. Dun, you should go to the other side of the mountain.” The mammoth stood there without moving. Only now and then a 
shudder would run through his body. And Anasta began whispering once more: “I am Anasta! Do you hear me, Dun? I am Anasta. I won’t leave here without you. Turn and look at 
me, Dun.”</p><p>Dun the mammoth slowly pulled his head back from the block and turned it to the little girl. The thick fur on his forehead was wet, and he had a hard time raising 
his eyelids and looking at the little girl. Then, he made an effort and raised his trunk and touched its tip to Anasta’s shoulder. His trunk was totally cold. Anasta took it 
in her hands began rubbing it and blowing on it, as if by doing so she could warm the mammoth’s huge body. And she did actually warm it, not only with the warmth of her 
breath, but with something warmer and more meaningful as well. And the mammoth obeyed and followed Anasta, who led him by his trunk, as if she were leading him by the hand. 
Barely putting one foot in front of the other, Dun ascended to the mountaintop. There the exhausted little girl sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree and, pointing to a 
slope that still remained green, ordered the mammoth to make his way down.</p><p>“Dun, go down there. Go to your pasture. You’ll rest up there and get your strength back. And you’ll 
find some food for yourself there, too.” And she added, sternly, “Go, Dun, go down there.”</p><p>The mammoth obeyed and began slowly making his way down along the path to the still 
green valley. When he’d taken ten or so steps, he turned to Anasta, extended his trunk upward and trumpeted out a summons, the way he’d done when Anasta had run through the 
valley, asking her Motherland not to give in to the glacier, when she had shouted out her “He-e-ey!” and conquered the silence.</p><p>And just like she’d done then, Anasta summoned 
her strength and shouted out, “He-e-ey!” and waved to Dun as a sendoff for him on his downhill path. And Dun the mammoth made his way slowly down off the mountain, carrying 
out his mistress’ order. But she…</p><p>After a brief rest, Anasta stood up atop the rock and once again cast her gaze over the giant ice masses that had filled the space before her 
as far as the eye could see, and quietly, but confidently, she uttered the words:</p><p>“I am a person! My thought is powerful. I am directing my thought against you, glacier. You 
must stop and crawl back where you came from. With my thought I command you to do so.”</p><p>Down below, the sound of a crack was heard once more, and the ice moved a tiny bit 
closer to the mountain. A gust of cold air hit the little girl in the chest, as if trying to knock her off her feet.</p><p>“Go back, ice! I command you! Back!” Once again a crack, 
and once again the glacier advanced toward the little girl.</p><p>Anasta said nothing for a short time, gazing at the advancing glacier, and suddenly she smiled.</p><p>“I get it. You are 
feeding on my thought, glacier. I get it. But now you will cease to exist.”</p><p>Anasta turned her back on the glacier, sat down on a tree trunk and began looking at her still 
green valley. But Anasta did not see flowers and grasses that were withering from the cold. Rather, she was imagining the meadows blooming in vibrant color, imagining that 
snow-white and pink flowers were coming out on the trees, that birds were singing and grasshoppers were chirring in the grass. Imagining Great-grandfather Wood returning to 
the valley and the entire family line returning along with him. And Anasta was running toward him barefoot through the grass. More and more quickly all the time…</p><p>Anasta’s 
thought was speeding up more and more. She had enough time! In the space of a moment, she tenderly stroked a billion blades of grass. And she was able to imagine each one 
separately, from its root up to its little stem. She was able to send a little ray of sun to each one. Give each one a little drop of rain to drink and caress it with a 
breeze.</p><p>Anasta fell asleep on the rocks near the trunk of a fallen tree. A cold wind blew against her back. But even as the little girl was falling asleep, her thought was at 
work and speeding up more and more.</p><p>Hurtling lightning bolts coming from her thought touched everything in the space. Creation awoke. And the new was born in the space, as if 
Anasta’s entire Motherland had risen from a deep sleep. The thought kept working, even when the little girl Anasta fell into a sleep that would last thousands of years.</p><p>Her 
thought – the great human energy – lingered above the valley, caressing the bugs and the blades of grass, Kitten and Dun the mammoth.</p><p>The ice blocks shuddered and cracked, but 
they could move forward any further, not even a millimeter. They were melting. Streams of melted ice skirted the valley and flowed into rivers and lakes.</p><p>The glacier was 
melting, powerless to overcome human thought, the strongest energy of the Universe.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1014>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>14. What will these People Come to?</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Torrents of water from the melting glacier formed a large river. Its raging 
current swept up rocks and fallen trees as it went. It washed off and carried away the fertile topsoil, along with the vegetation and everything living in it. But the family 
valley that people had been forced to abandon was left untouched by the fearsome stream.</p><p>The foliage on the trees in the valley yellowed and fell off, and there was no singing 
of birds to be heard. But some number of the plants continued fighting for their lives, adapting to the cooling that was unusual for these parts. And, amazingly enough, 
Anasta’s favorite flower still remained in her once very lovely flower bed.</p><p>The valley was shielded by the ridge of mountains, atop one of which the little girl Anasta had 
fallen into a sleep that would last thousands of years.</p><p>Two athletic youths, one light-haired and one dark-haired, stood at the foot of the mountain. They were looking at a 
huge block of granite that extended out over the ground. Drops of water were forcing their way along both sides.</p><p>The dark-haired youth spoke with joyful Schadenfreude:</p><p>“That’s 
what they get, these people who’ve lost their sense. Little by little, some time in the next two days, the water will gradually wash away the support around the rock, and it 
will collapse, opening up a path for the death-dealing torrent to make its way into the valley. The water will rush like a powerful waterfall, tearing off and carrying the 
mountain rocks away with it, and little by little it will erode the entire mountain and carry it away. Once the torrent that’s coming in on the right of the mountain has 
thrown this giant rock aside, it will rush into the crevice that forms, making it larger and larger, and it will change direction.”</p><p>“Yes, if this block collapses in the next 
two days, before the torrent reaches the sloping lands beyond the valley and floods it, thereby lessening the water pressure, then it will rush with all its strength into 
Anastochka’s family valley,” the light-haired youth agreed. And he added, “Now I regret having taken form in a human body. Right now we need an animal with a powerful body, 
to prop up this block.”</p><p>“Ha, ha, he regrets he’s not a powerful animal! Sure, you could have adopted its appearance, but then you would have had to resemble it, too. You 
wouldn’t have been able to speak like a human and realize that the block will soon be carried away by the torrent.</p><p>“Yep, what are you jabbering on and on about, with your 
‘family valley’ and your ‘Anastochka’… It’s all the same to her now. Her Soul is soaring in the immense Universe.”</p><p>“Soaring. Yes…” Light-haired said, thoughtfully and 
tenderly. “The thought has been carefully preserved in it, and the dream. Awareness, great knowledge. All the same, she really did manage to stop the glacier. The Daughter of 
God grasped the power of human thought through her feelings. She altered God’s plan a tiny bit.”</p><p>“Exactly – a tiny bit! And how much slobbery tenderness is there in your 
words? Just a tiny bit, I might add. A tiny bit. And you? ‘She grasped it through her feelings’ and ‘Daughter of God’…” Dark-haired said, mockingly mimicking him. Speaking 
with abandon, he went on. “The raging torrent will rush into the valley anyway. It’s rushing after the crowd of idiots who don’t even suspect that they themselves – and their 
thoughts and actions that drew them away from the natural and toward the artificial – are the cause of the disaster. For now, their aspirations are still in the beginning 
stages, but we know how destructive these aspirations are for them, and for the Earth and for the whole Universe. And so that they don’t suffer, and so that they don’t tear 
the surface of the Earth to bits, they will be destroyed – in accord with God’s program – at the very beginning stages of the disastrous aspiration. The raging torrent will 
overcome them. A huge, roaring tidal wave of water, rocks, fallen tree trunks and corpses of the formerly living will make its way unforgivingly toward them.</p><p>“At first, when 
they hear the rumbling behind them, they’ll feel something is wrong and pick up their pace. But the rumbling will grow, and off in the distance they’ll see a huge wall moving 
toward them, bringing death. For them it will signify the Flood. They will all be gripped by terror – their mammoth-elephants, their kittens, their children and their old 
folk. And their Souls will fly up into the Universe, retaining within them only the horrors.”</p><p>With a kind of venomous passion Dark-haired began using facial expressions and 
gestures to portray these people who had been gripped by terror. Mothers, pressing their infants to their breast, people who had knelt down with their hands stretched out to 
the heavens, feverishly praying for mercy. Others, running with their last ounce of strength and shouting. Dark-haired began running around in a circle, wailing, showing 
terror on his face. Then he stopped, glancing in the direction of the people who were leaving, and said:</p><p>“My pale-faced brother, do you get it? Do you get what kind of 
unavoidable destiny will overcome these people? And so, that little girlie, asleep on the mountain, didn’t change God’s program in any substantial way.”</p><p>“The way you’ve 
modeled the human future is not to my liking, Brother. We, Universal entities, can probably take some action. It’s not our business to remain indifferent. When we’re 
indifferent, then we do not exist.”</p><p>“What does the future care about your ‘to my liking’, ‘not to my liking’, if it’s unavoidable?” Dark-haired sneered.</p><p>Without waiting to hear 
his brother’s answer, he turned sharply and saw… His light-haired brother had gone to stand beneath the granite block and all on his own, with his shoulders and arms, propped 
it up. The stream of water flowing along the edges of the block became significantly smaller.</p><p>“Idiotic, senseless and irrational,” Dark-haired said after a brief pause. Then 
he was silent a bit longer, as if deliberating about something, and then he began shaming his brother with new-found strength, attempting to prove the senselessness of his 
actions: “There’s no one here, and thus, there’s no one to laugh at your total idiocy. Before you went to stand under that granite block, you didn’t even take the time to 
calculate how much it weighs. The water’s still oozing through, and the supports holding the granite up are eroding, and that means more and more weight will be pressing down 
on you. Do you understand that, you pale-faced idiot?”</p><p>“By force of my will, I will condense to the density of the granite, and I’ll be able to hold my ground. I only need 
hold out for two days. I’ll hold out!” said the light-haired athlete.</p><p>“Right! ‘I’ll hold out,’ ‘I’ll condense,’… Well, go on, then, condense away, to the density of the 
granite. But what’s your load-bearing surface area? Your load-bearing surface area is the size of the soles of your two feet. And along toward the middle of the second day, 
the whole burden will come to rest upon you, and you’ll sink into the ground like some kind of granite stake, shoving the smaller rubble off to the sides. As soon as you sink 
in up to your knees, the torrent of water will shove the block aside.”</p><p>“I’ll straighten my arms out. Then I’ll be able to hold out half a day more.”</p><p>“Yes, of course, you’ll 
hold out. Only not for half a day. You’ll hold out, maybe for an hour more, you clueless blockhead. Then there’ll be a landslide. For all of eternity, since the moment of 
creation, never once has God’s program experienced a glitch. And I am in agreement with it. Given that mankind is stepping onto an absurd path of development, it’s better to 
put them down at the beginning of their path. Maybe a new civilization on Earth will comprehend its life’s purpose and then we’ll comprehend. The Universe will see new deeds, 
not today’s primitivism. Numerous times, the earth has experienced disasters that have washed away the filth that Man accumulated.</p><p>“Who is it you want to save? Mankind, which 
with its very own hands will, in the future, create a living hell for itself and everything living on Earth? Do I need to remind you where the technocratic path will drag 
them off to in the future? Should I remind you? Why don’t you say something? Ah, excellent! You’re condensing and petrifying. Are you already having a hard time talking? 
Don’t talk, then. Excellent! Stand there like a stone idol and look. Look at the pictures of the future life of the people you’re trying to save. I’ve always admired them. 
There’s the most unenlightened folly, absurdity and vanity in them. But you don’t like looking at them, these pictures. Go on and look now, my pale-faced, petrifying, 
motionless one. Look! But no, first listen and hear what you don’t want to hear.</p><p>“If those who have left the valley aren’t destroyed, they’ll follow their technocratic path. 
They’ll multiply, and from one generation to the next, they’ll break, destroy and remold the great earthly harmony. And they’ll kill animals. Animals who are meant to serve 
them. They’ll construct a multitude of various soulless devices out of completely living material. They’ll start referring to their actions using the resonant words 
‘industrialization,’ ‘scientific and technical progress,’ and they’ll invest these words with the implication of intelligent development.</p><p>“Well, and what kind of development? 
Do they possess rationality? Are they developing in a rational way? Like crazy folk, they will destroy unsurpassed creations and call their own barbaric actions ‘progress.’ 
They are ill! A virus has taken up residence in their minds. And the epidemic will smite all of mankind. This virus is more terrible than the complete annihilation of 
everything on earth. It threatens the entire Universe. It is called… Have you already guess what word I’m going to utter now? More than once you’ve beseeched me not to repeat 
it and have turned away from me and hurried to walk off, away from me, but now you won’t turn away, you won’t walk off. What will strike this whole human civilization is… 
anti-rationality.</p><p>“Struck by this anti-rationality, mankind will enter into the virus’ dimension. It will begin performing deeds unsurpassed in their idiocy and villainy, 
cloaking them in the words ‘progress,’ ‘advanced,’ ‘moral,’ ‘lovely,’ ‘rational,’ and ‘spiritual’ when they speak to each other. Now that’s some kind of development, right?</p><p>“No, I can’t get by without a visual here! Now, take a look.”</p><p>The dark-haired youth traced a square in the air with his hand, and a hologram immediately appeared inside it.</p><p>The 
hologram showed a twelve-story building being built. Two cranes were raising building materials up to the already complete stories. People in orange hardhats and blue 
coveralls who were busy doing the finishing work on the dwellings could be seen through the window openings.</p><p>The dark-haired youth commented:</p><p>“This incomprehensible thing here 
with a great number of cells – they’re going to call that a ‘home.’ Anti-rationality is turning people into anti-people. They have distorted the concept and the meaning 
behind the words ‘my home.’</p><p>“They’ve replaced the home – a living space formed by a person’s thought, and reflecting his thought capacity – with an artificial, stone cell. And 
they’ve called it a ‘home,’ as some kind of travesty of Rationality. The Universe is not in need of their limited thought. It is becoming a breeding ground for anti-
rationality and develops and strengthens its might. And this breeding ground is growing larger and larger.”</p><p>The hologram stretched out from horizon to horizon, showing the 
building of a multitude of little boxes with artificial, stone cells. Some of them were collapsing, but the people in the orange hardhats were erecting new, even taller stone 
structures with a multitude of cells in their place.</p><p>Dark-haired continued:</p><p>“To gain the right to live in these cells, they will have to perform deeds that aren’t proper for a 
rational being – Man! Children of God! Goddesses! Take a look, my pale-faced brother, take a look at these deeds.”</p><p>The dark-haired youth waved his hand once more, and a square 
with a hologram appeared once again. This time it showed a huge grocery store. A great many people were gathering all manner of items to purchase, placing them into metal 
baskets and walking up to one of the cash registers arranged in a row, to pay for the goods they’d chosen.</p><p>“These are the beings from the stone cells. Every day they engage in 
various deeds that are worthless in terms of rationality, and they call their deeds ‘work.’ For their work they receive slips of paper that they call ‘money.’ Here you see 
them exchanging the money they’ve received for food.</p><p>“In the beginning, God created everything so that all a rational person had to do was stretch out his hand and take the 
Divine creation that was to his liking and enjoy consuming it, thereby increasing the energy inside him and satisfying his body. But these beings have altered their way of 
life so much that there’s none of God’s food around them. The food they acquire in exchange for the slips of paper does not possess Divine energy. The beings who have created 
this way of life cannot be called rational. Their way of life is the result of anti-rationality.”</p><p>The picture in the square changed, and now it was showing a close-up of a 
female cashier. One after another, people would come up to her cash register and lay out this or that kind of packages, boxes, cans and bottles on a little table in front of 
the woman. Smiling, the woman would say, “Hello,” to each of them. She’d take the packages, pass them over some kind of little pane of glass, after which numerals 
representing the product’s price would light up on the cash register. The cashier would take some money from the person and say to him, smiling again, “Thank you for your 
purchase. Come visit us again.”</p><p>And now there was a close-up in the square, showing the woman’s face at the moment when she turned away from the people who were standing in 
line and bent down to the floor to pick up a bag that had fallen. She turned away from the people standing before her for only a few seconds, and some kind of sad and doomed 
expression appeared on her face. Her eyelids began to close a bit, betraying an incredible weariness. The woman picked the bag up with one hand and pressed the other to her 
side, wincing in pain. All of this lasted just a very short time. When she turned back to the people, there was a smile on her face once more, and once more she said to each 
one, “Hello. Thank you for your purchase. Come visit us again.”</p><p>The dark-haired youth commented:</p><p>“You see, my brother? Before you is a being you call a goddess. She sits behind 
a register made up of a multitude of little screws and circuits, and she herself is less perfected than those little screws. The register has no soul and no rationality. It 
just acts in accord with its prescribed program. Now this being sits behind it twelve hours a day, tapping away at its keys and saying thank you to every person. What’s this 
being thanking each person who comes up for? For nothing – it is simply a robot. It should have rationality, but it sits and taps away at the keys of some register for twelve 
hours at a time. It will do that for half of its life, so that it can finally end up in a stone cell.</p><p>“Rationality wouldn’t have allowed something like that to take place, so 
that means that the anti-rationality virus is at work in her, that this woman is not a person, but an anti-person, and that she is located in the dimension of anti-
rationality. Her internal organs have been petrified, she does not receive normal food, and the blood in her veins is solidifying and stagnating because she has to sit for 
twelve hours at a time. She looks older than her years. Look! This is the way she should look at her age, if she were in the dimension of Rationality, if she were a person. 
Now I’ll show her in the natural dimension at this same time. Look!”</p><p>A new hologram in the square showed a slender, blond beauty running along the side of a brook toward a 
naked little boy, her son. The beauty ran up to him, scooped him up in her arms and spun around, bursting into happy laughter.</p><p>The two women, living in different dimensions 
bore little resemblance to each other.</p><p>The supermarket cashier sitting at the register appeared in the square once more.</p><p>“This is just one little isolated instance,” Dark-
haired said. “Would you say it’s totally uncharacteristic of all mankind? Take a look.”</p><p>Next he spread his arms out, and the picture in the square spread out from horizon to 

horizon, and a picture appeared: hundreds of thousands of people were sitting behind various registers in tightly packed rows, tapping away at the keys. They were varied, 
these people. Very young girls and elderly women, and there were some men, too. Then a picture appeared in space – hundreds of thousands of hands were tapping away 
incessantly at the registers’ keys. In the corner of the boundless screen the sun appeared, then the moon replaced it, then the sun appeared again, replacing a half moon. The 
daytime and nighttime luminaries measured off the days and months and years, like a clock. But the people who had filled the entire space from horizon to horizon, kept on 
tapping away at the keys of their registers, repeating, as if they were robots, “Hello, thank you for your purchase. Come visit us again.”</p><p>“Look, my brother. Take a look. Now 
it will get even more interesting. Take a look at mankind’s future.”</p><p>A hologram appeared in space, showing a close up of a person running with a sword in his hands, his face 
distorted by rage. It was replaced by a picture of a person lying on the ground in the mud, spraying machine gun fire. Then three people appeared who were shooting a cannon. 
And the entire space suddenly filled up with a multitude of people. They were shown as very tiny, so that more of them would fit into the space. With swords, pitchforks, 
scythes, machine guns and cannons, the people were cutting each other down and shooting at each other. They were strangling each other with their hands and kicking them with 
their feet. From up above, flying machines were dropping objects down onto the ground that was teeming with a mass of people. Upon reaching the ground, the objects would 
explode, sending up clumps of mud and the remains of human bodies.</p><p>“Did rational beings create this mess, my brother? And they’re anti-rational because they’ve taken into 
their heads to justify this, too. They’ll call this mess ‘war.’ They’ll give various decorations to those who excel in this slaughter, and the ones who receive these medals 
will proudly wear them on their chest. They’ll learn to pass laws that justify this slaughter that will go on for centuries without ceasing.”</p><p>Dark-haired waved his hands once 
more, and a hologram appeared in the space once more, divided into a great many squares. Each square showed the interior of various halls where people were sitting and 
listening to people speaking from rostrums.</p><p>“They have different names for this: a Congress, Parliament, Duma, or a House, but they’re all essentially the same thing.</p><p>“Do you 
see the people sitting their, my brother? You can still see, so take a look. The people sitting before you are writing laws for various peoples and, if you lump them all 
together, for all mankind. They’ve been writing them for millennia, but there are no perfected laws – nor can there be. Do you get that, my brother? Of course, you get it!”</p><p>Dark-haired roared with laughter. His spiteful laughter filled the valley, and its echo bounced off the ridge of mountain. He stopped laughing and, turning to the pictures 
with the people sitting in them, shouted, as if they could hear and understand him:</p><p>“You’ll never be able to write perfected laws because you don’t know the most important 
thing. You don’t know the life’s purpose of each separate man and of mankind as a whole. This life’s purpose – the Universal life’s purpose – has been expressed in just four 
words. It is the foundation of all laws. It and only it, can string all the Earth’s laws onto itself, like beads onto a thread, or repulse them. But you don’t know what it is 
– you’ve forgotten it.</p><p>“Do you get it, my brother? They’ve forgotten the most important thing, and now they’re in the dimension of anti-rationality. They’ve forgotten that 
their life’s purpose has been laid out in four words. What words are those? Do you want me to utter them, my brother? You do! Of course you do, very much. You’re always 
uttering them, in the hope that they’ll hear you and understand. You utter them, but they don’t hear. They don’t hear because they’re located in the dimension of anti-
rationality, and if I utter them, if you and I utter them together, they’ll hear. They’ll start to take action, and they’ll become people. But I won’t utter them.</p><p>“Let them 
deliberate until the next worldwide disaster, which will be unprecedented in scale and strength. It will approach inexorably, and they will be powerless to use their laws to 
stop it from approaching. These beings know of the approaching disaster. They even know why it will occur, and they can’t manage to change their way of life. They can’t 
manage at all. If you look at them, they still resemble people, but only on the outside. They themselves – just think about it, my brother – for centuries, they themselves 
have been inventing various mechanical substitutes for human capabilities. Just look what they’re turning into.”</p><p>A hologram appeared in space. The right side showed the 
handsome, well-proportioned body of a youth, clad only in a loincloth, while the left side showed a girl in a short little grass skirt. Between them was a circle filled with 
a great many small, multicolored circles.</p><p>“In the circle I’m showing the capabilities with which each man was endowed inherently. They were capable of much…”</p><p>Night replaced day 
in the hologram. The young man glanced up at the heavens and said, “Today in the heavens above me, nine billion, eighty two stars can be seen.” “My love,” the girl said, 
replying to the youth, “right now in the heavens above you, nine billion eighty three stars can be seen. There’s one you didn’t notice. It’s not at all bright. I will wait 
for you on it. We will create a space of love on it, and it will begin to shine with a bright blue light. For the time being, our star is barely noticeable.”</p><p>“Yes, they were 
capable of much,” Dark-haired commented. “Their initial capabilities enabled them to create everything you can imagine. And even things you can’t. But once they start 
inventing mechanical, non-rational capability substitutes, they’ll begin losing their God-given talents.” Calculating devices appeared one after another and then disappeared, 
and as each of the instruments appeared, several of the little circles decreased in size, some of them actually turning into black dots. “They used to be capable of counting 
all the stars by glancing at the sky for just an instant, but they’ll get to the point in their inventions that they’ll be calculating ‘two plus two’ on calculators.</p><p>“They’ll 
invent the telephone and will begin losing the ability to communicate over distance and imagine their loved ones’ whereabouts.</p><p>“In the end, they’ll begin implanting artificial 
devices into their bodies,” Dark-haired went on, “and they themselves will turn more and more into a primitive, soulless device. It will be impossible to call them ‘people.’ 
Their rationality is stuffed down somewhere deep inside. Anti-rationality dominates them. It is simultaneously around them and within them. Take a look, my brother – now 
you’ll see my final little picture.”</p><p>Dark-haired waved his hand, and on the screen, in the steaming air, hovering in the air, was a folded-out map of the Earth – that part of 
it where people lived very densely in the cities. And in each city, the stout tentacles of some monstrously large being were wending their way between the large 
concentrations of people, weaving in and out and shuddering. They were great in number. They encircled the cities and were also located inside them. Some kind of foul-
smelling, dark-colored gas was being emitted from the great number of pores on each tentacle. But the people weren’t shrinking back from these terrifying emissions – they 
were breathing them. The people were building their homes close to the tentacles. From time to time, first in one spot and then in another, the reeking tentacles would burst, 
seemingly due to great pressure, and the people would rush to patch and smooth out these blow-outs, so as to restore the monstrous octopus’ vital functions.</p><p>“My brother, do 
you see the tentacles of the monstrous octopus? Perhaps you want me to show you the body of the monster that has covered the world with its tentacles? Naturally, you don’t 
even want to think and speak about this. But I’ll tell you right where this death-dealing body is located. I’ll tell you where the tentacles are coming from. They’re coming 
from the brains of these beings who used to be considered rational people. The monster’s body is inside their brains – that’s where they’re all coming from. And they are 
proud of their death-dealing progeny – they cherish it. They call the monstrous tentacles ‘roads’ and ‘highways.’” Dark-haired roared with laughter. “There you have it – the 
future of mankind! And you want to save to save those who are heading for the dimension of anti-rationality? You want to save them for that fate?” Dark-haired asked, turning 
to his brother who was holding the block of granite back, keeping it from falling.</p><p>It wasn’t just little drops of water that were seeping around the block of granite any more 
– now the water was flowing around it in thin streams. The body of the light-haired youth supporting the block of granite was petrifying ever more intensely. Even his facial 
muscles had hardened, and he could neither speak nor blink. Only his blue eyes, still alive, were looking at the pictures of mankind’s future.</p><p>The dark-haired youth stuck his 
palm beneath a stream of the water that was running off and said, his voice full of venom:</p><p>“There’s precious little time left before the flood. Maybe I’d have time to say 
three or four more phrases to you, my brother, but I’m not going to say anything. Most likely you can’t hear me any more.”</p><p>The dark-haired youth spread his arms out to the 
sides then bent his elbows, amusing himself with his athletic muscles, then shook his head, tossing his black locks of hair back. He spent a bit more time observing the 
streams of water flowing around the block of granite his brother was propping up, watching them grow stronger. Then he said:</p><p>“It’s time for me to be going. It’s time. Now what 
has been preordained to come to pass shall come to pass. But… it shall not come to pass.”</p><p>The dark-haired athlete strode up to the bock of granite and, taking his place 
alongside his light-haired brother, propped up the block of granite with his own shoulders and arms.</p><p>The muscles of the athletic body tensed, and the veins stood out, but the 
dark-haired athlete slowly straightened out his slightly bent knees and raised the granite a bit. The water stopped seeping around the edges of the block – only a few drops 
were still rolling off it.</p><p>The Universal opposites united in one for a short time, having changed God’s program. God’s program… Perhaps by uniting, they had opened up new 
possibilities for the program?</p><p>After a short time, the raging, shattering torrent reached the plains, and the danger that Anasta’s family valley would be flooded passed – and 
along with it, the danger that the people who had left the valley would perish.</p><p>The light-haired youth’s petrification began to gradually pass, a smile came to his face, and 
he regained his ability to speak.</p><p>“Thank you, Brother,” Light-haired said, albeit it still with difficulty.</p><p>“Only I don’t need any of your ‘thank yous.’ This disaster that was 
predestined for people, it’s passed. Now they’ll go even further along in their absurd worldview. They’ll stubbornly construct the anti-world. There will be more of them, and 
there will be a new disaster, on a bigger scale.”</p><p>“There won’t be one, Brother. Maybe it’ll happen just an instant before any disaster happens, but the Soul particles, and 
feelings and knowledge that the little girl Anasta dissolved in the space will awaken within people’s hearts. And a great many women and men will stop the unprecedented 
disaster with their thoughts. And people living in the dimension of anti-rationality will suddenly see the light. They’ll begin to build a new world on Earth, never before 
seen by anyone.</p><p>“They, the ones who have simultaneously experienced both anti-rationality and Rationality, will unite what is opposite within themselves, in harmony. And they 
will bring to life the Divine impulse of His dream in matter and spirit. Not simply will they bring it to life. To it they will add their dream's perfection."</p><p>Anastasia fell 
silent. And I was silent, too, as I tried to make sense of what had been said and seen. Only after an hour or two did I ask her a question.</p><p><div class=chapter id=1015>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>15. Coming Face to Face with our Primeval Image</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“Anastasia, everything you showed me and told me about the dark-haired and light-haired youths and about the little girl Anasta – did all of that exist in reality, or only in 
your imagination?”</p><p>“You can choose your own answer to that question yourself, Vladimir.”</p><p>“What do you mean, I can choose it myself? You’re the only one who can say for certain 
whether it actually happened or whether you imagined it.”</p><p>“Tell me, Vladimir, did any new information appear to you from my story?”</p><p>“I sure did. Of course, I did. Information 
and images… I’ll say!”</p><p>“So that means the information exists?”</p><p>“Yes, it exists. I need to analyze it, make sense of it. And I have questions.”</p><p>“If information appeared, then it 
follows that its source also exists.”</p><p>“Of course. There has to be a source.”</p><p>“Information is an image. An image is information. If someone decides he wants to erase information 
within you, he’ll try to prove to you that the image doesn’t exist in reality. And as soon as you agree with the image’s lack of reality, then you yourself erase the 
information you’ve taken in from the image.”</p><p>“Well, but if this or that image was created by a person, then who’s the information coming from in that case?”</p><p>“From the image.”</p><p>“Why from the image, if some specific person created it?”</p><p>“If a child was born to you, Vladimir, a child who imparted new information to all people – including to you, too – 
then who is the source of the new information?”</p><p>“The child, of course. But an image – now, an image isn’t a child who has a material body. An image can be non-material, too.”</p><p>“So, does that mean the difference lies only in that in the first case you can see a material body, but in the second you can’t?”</p><p>“Maybe that’s not quite it. It’s just that 
when there’s a body, it looks more familiar somehow, more credible.”</p><p>“A body you can see bears no definitive evidence. And what’s more, it can lead you astray.”</p><p>“Now that’s 
true. It sure can! There’s even an article in the criminal code called ‘fraud.’ That’s when a criminal – who has a body – deceives someone for his own personal gain. I think 
I’ve got everything, Anastasia. If information appears, and what’s more, if it comes from an image, then all of that exists – you can’t deny it – and we need to analyze the 
information we’ve received. But when we get caught up in thinking about it – ‘does it exist or doesn’t it exist’ – then we’re wasting time and depriving ourselves of the 
information we’ve gained.”</p><p>“Yes, you’ve understood correctly, Vladimir.”</p><p>“There’s just one thing I don’t get. If every person can think up an image, and the image begins to 
exist, then how much information do we have to sift through in order to come up with what’s genuine?”</p><p>“Not much at all. Certainly, every person can think up an image, but 
people will not accept every image with their whole heart and soul, not at all.”</p><p>“Well, yes, of course. Not every image. Really, thank you, Anastasia. It’s interesting what 
you have to say about the image. Tell me something else about the image. What’s your opinion – what is it?”</p><p>“Man himself is, in fact, an image that has taken material form, 
and since he is a materialized image, man himself can use his thought to create and can materialize images. This is where his Universal power, a power unsurpassed by no one 
and no thing, lies.</p><p>“If this or that person doesn't recognize the capabilities within him that have been given him by the Creator, then that person himself blocks his lofty 
power and falls under the influence of other images and materializes their thoughts, until finally he destroys himself, his family, his family line, his state and the whole 
planet.</p><p>“The artificial, technocratic world was also created by Man using the energy of an image suggested to Man by his antipodes. The technocratic world is fragile and 
transitory. Even the most advanced car, building or any other object of the artificial world disintegrates with each second and within but a few years turns to dust or, worse 
still, into waste products harmful for Man.</p><p>“Man himself, by living in the artificial world, becomes fragile and transitory as well. For it is hard for a person who spends 
each minute looking at a multitude of disintegrating objects that lack autogenic capability, to imagine eternal life, create the image of his own eternity and materialize 
it.</p><p>“The natural world that is visible to us has existed not for billions of years, but for significantly longer, for at the beginning it already existed within an as yet 
non-materialized image. The scientists who determined the Earth’s age calculated not the date of its birth, but merely the date of its materialization, as one of the stages 
of its life.</p><p>“The natural world possesses the capability for autogenesis, and this capability renders it eternal. The Creator, who created eternity, is himself the very same. 
He is Alpha and Omega, and Alpha once more.</p><p>“A great many people might say or think, ‘What was there before the birth of the Creator and of His extraordinary, multitudinous 
energies?’ At one time nothing existed. Nothing! But recall what the Creator said about ‘nothing’ to His son: ‘Out of nothing will arise the beautiful new birth of you and of 
the aspiration reflecting your soul and dream. My Son, you are infinite, eternal. Within you lie your creating dreams.’</p><p>“But if out of ‘nothing’ arises something, this means 
that ‘nothing,’ too, takes part in the birth.</p><p>“By giving birth – out of ‘nothing’, in part – the Creator completed the circle and presented to Man the image of eternity.</p><p>“The 
knowledge, understanding and perception of the energy of the image within him enable Man to not die, but rather to drift off into an ambrosial sleep. Upon awakening, he 
incarnates in the spot, time and image necessary to him and created by him before his sleep.</p><p>“Gaining knowledge of the science of imagery leads to understanding the entire 
universe created by the Creator, and to the creation of new and beautiful worlds.</p><p>“Lack of knowledge and understanding of the science of imagery leads unavoidably to 
unskillful interaction with the perfected, natural world, and to the creation of an artificial, primitive, unnatural world.</p><p>“Lack of knowledge of the science of imagery turns 
entire states and peoples into puppets, into chess pieces in the hands of those who are acquainted with this great gift.”</p><p>“But Anastasia, after all, images can be positive and 
negative. How are we supposed to figure out which of them bears useful information and which is misinforming us, perhaps for personal gain?”</p><p>“Through your own self, Vladimir, 
and through your own image you will discern the value of any information.”</p><p>“You mean every person has an image?”</p><p>“Why of course, Vladimir. Every person has his own image. Each 
differs strikingly from the others.</p><p>“Were every person to preserve his primeval image, then tell me, Vladimir, how would the world now look?”</p><p>“Primeval? That means every person 
has – or used to have – a primeval image? What was it like?”</p><p>“Divine! Such is the way our parent – the Creator – did create it in his inspired impulse.”</p><p>“It – our primeval 
image – was it God, or what?”</p><p>“It was the son of God, and so it remains.”</p><p>“But where’s this primeval image of man gotten to? We can see images of drunks and drug addicts on the 
streets. And images of prostitutes along the roads. And various images make fools of themselves on TV. Where can we get a glimpse of man’s primeval image?”</p><p>“Within ourselves. 
Imagine it yourself. Go out to meet it. And joyfully will it rush toward you. Joyful will the path be. Gradually coming nearer and nearer to each other, you will one day 
encounter each other. You will unite! Safeguard your primeval image. Do not give it over to others for their own delight.”</p><p>“But how can I imagine it? There’s all sorts of 
information raining down on us about how man’s imperfect.</p><p>“First they say he’s an eternal slave, then that he’s like a lab rat. One of my friends told me a while back that he 
read in some book somewhere that they said something like some alien beings created people and are now feeding on their energy and are training them to be imbeciles.”</p><p>“Should 
you wish to be an imbecile, Vladimir, then go ahead and believe them.</p><p>“Should you believe you’re a slave, you will give birth to a slave within you.</p><p>“Should you believe that 
someone is feeding on your energy against your very will, you will waste away and really will give over your own energy.</p><p>“Everything exists that you yourself believe to 
exist.</p><p>“From the very moment of birth, they try to belittle the significance of Man – the son of God. But take note, Vladimir, behind this there always stands someone striving 
to elevate himself. He is, in actual fact, not elevated when compared to Man, and is unable to elevate himself. And only one path is left to him – to belittle the elevated 
one and prevent him from growing.”</p><p>“Yes, Anastasia, you’re exactly right here. I somehow can’t recall even a single book or movie where man is presented as the strongest being 
in the Universe. It’s always the aliens that emerge as the strongest, and if the people are strong, too, then it’s always connected to some otherworldly powers. Now I 
understand what serious and ongoing indoctrination man is being subjected to, and of course, it’s no accident. There’s somebody who needs this very much.</p><p>“If Man really were 
weak and didn’t possess some kind of mysterious and unknown power, then why be afraid of him? Why take such great pains to prove the opposite?</p><p>“Anastasia, you’re the only one 
who sees man as the son of God and the strongest being in the Universe. But that means that a great many other images will come out in opposition to your explanation of what 
man’s image is. They have methods that have been developed over the course of millennia.</p><p>“They’ve already created a great many images of powerless people.</p><p>“Plus many various 
teachings that belittle man. The press the world over is working for them, and the screenwriters and directors, too, and there a lot of them, really a lot. Looks like you’re 
on your own, Anastasia. But all the same you’re placing your hopes on something. Where are you placing them? Where, Anastasia?”</p><p>“On my very own primeval image. And on your 
primeval image, Vladimir. On the primeval nature of those images of the people building homesteads. Those who will in the future set off to meet their true image.”</p><p>“Anastasia, 
and they also say you don’t exist at all. And about me, they say I’m not the person I seem to be, not the way I appear in the books. Now I see that by doing what they’re 
doing, they’re trying to erase the information coming from your image, erase it in people. And they’re succeeding in part. There are readers, even among those who are 
building family homesteads, who say, hey, let’s not mention Anastasia’s name. Let’s not talk about the books and let’s not call our family homesteads family homesteads, given 
that someone has convinced the authorities that these names are bad. They even offer them various concessions for doing that.”</p><p>“And you, Vladimir? How do you feel about 
suggestions of that sort?”</p><p>“To tell the truth, Anastasia, even I had the thought that, given that these words are irritating to some people, maybe it would be better not to 
utter them. You know, so things would move along more quickly. Now I get that the process might move along on the surface, but it won’t be in quite the direction man needs. 
Now I get it: they don’t want us to utter the words ‘Anastasia’, ‘family homesteads’ and ‘ringing cedars of Russia’ because strong images and information immediately come up 
once we do. They want to deprive people of them. Am I understanding things correctly?”</p><p>“Of course, Vladimir, behind each word there really does stand an image, and 
information. It is sometimes the case, that behind just one word there stands such a huge volume of information that it would be impossible for even a hundred volumes to 
reflect its image, to substitute for it.”</p><p>“Well, you know, there are words that awaken different images in people. For example, the word ‘war.’ Some people might see a 
liberating war behind this word, and others an invasive one.”</p><p>“But nonetheless, when this word is uttered, in people’s imaginations there immediately arise a great many 
pictures of battles, of warring countries, of weaponry and many other things. And even if the pictures are a bit different, this is of no consequence: they are great in 
number, and similar, but there is but one word.”</p><p>“‘Family homestead’ – can there be a great many different images behind these words, too?”</p><p>“‘Family homestead’ is a word-
combination backed by the most powerful of images, images capable of settling a person in a Divine dwelling land10. Judge for yourself, Vladimir: the first three letters of 
this word-combination form the word “rod”11. “Rod” means the people who come into life one after another, and the first of these came from God. Each person born today takes 
his place at the head of this great chain. It is within his power to settle his “rod” in one dwelling land or another. In a stone cell or in the beautiful space of his family 
homestead. Or – he can break the family chain altogether. It is within his power to nourish his family with Divine creation or with food that doesn’t bear the energy of the 
Soul.”</p><p>“What does food have to do with anything here, Anastasia, if my family’s ancestors are long dead?”</p><p>“Tiny parts of all your ancestors live on within you, Vladimir. Both 
your body and your spirit come from them.”</p><p>“Well, sure, they come from them. But… But that means that each person born anew bears a colossal responsibility for the fate of the 
entire family line.”</p><p>“Yes, each one bears it, Vladimir, and each one is given the power to decide his own fate and the fate of his family line.”</p><p>“I agree that we’re given that 
power. But the great majority of people don’t really think about their family line, and maybe their ancestors didn’t think about it, either. So does that mean the family line 
that stretches from the wellspring people12, from God himself, has disintegrated, fallen to pieces, that it no longer exists?”</p><p>“Family homestead – please, Vladimir, think 
about it. Family homestead – two words. One word-combination. As soon as a person utters it, then the person – who perhaps hasn’t yet even fully realized his aspiration – 
except subconsciously – has given voice to it: ‘I gather together my entire family line and settle it here.’”</p><p> <div class=chapter id=1016>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>16. The Gatherer of one's Family Line</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“A person who has established his 
family homestead can gather together within it the souls of people from his family line, and they will be grateful to him for this great deed. Like guardian angels, they will 
protect and guard the family homestead and the person who created it. Nothing in the Universe disappears without a trace; it only passes from one state into another. When a 
person dies and his mortal body is given over to the land, then trees and grass and flowers grow up out of it. It passes from one state into another. But then, into what 
state does the main energetic complex – the human Soul – pass?</p><p>“At first, it lingers, hovering at the place where the person’s body is located, and in some religions, people 
understand this and don’t immediately commit the person’s body to the earth. And when the person’s body does join into an embrace with the earth, when the person is buried in 
a cemetery, then the Soul hovers above the spot where the body has been buried. The relatives spend some period of time near the grave. The Soul, deprived of its body – and 
so, of hearing and sight – cannot see or hear, but it can feel when people are speaking of it, or thinking of it. If they are saying good things, the Soul feels good, but if 
they are saying bad things, the Soul feels bad.</p><p>“Then the people leave the cemetery. For a certain period of time, the Soul remains above the mound of earth where its body is 
buried, but it no longer feels anything, only emptiness. Modern people, caught up in the everyday bustle of life, quickly forget their deceased relatives. In modern people’s 
apartments, often nothing at all serves as a reminder of the deceased relatives. After a year or five or ten, basically no one remembers them any more, and the souls of the 
deceased end up in a complete void. And we are speaking here about the recently deceased, but you know, there are also those relatives who lived a hundred, or a thousand or a 
million years ago, and they all find themselves in complete oblivion.</p><p>“A person who creates a family homestead can gather together his entire family line. To do this, he needs 
to call to mind his relative and imagine him or her, and then the Soul will give a little start. It will sense it’s being thought of, and no matter in which corner of the 
Universe it might be located, it will shoot off along this thought-ray to the place from which it is emanating.</p><p>“A person isn’t able to remember all his relatives and 
continually think about them and recall them, but he can plant a small grove of trees, preferably family trees13, that live a long time. These include oaks and cedars. As he 
plants them, he should definitely contribute his own family thought, saying to himself: ‘I am planting this grove or alley in memory of the members of my family line. I am 
creating a family homestead, and may all the members of my family line who have lived in the past and who will live in the future gather together on it.’</p><p>“As he plants each 
individual tree, it’s essential that he recall the name of one or another relative who has recently passed, and to imagine each of them and say a kind word about them.</p><p>“A 
person isn’t able to recall each of his family members every minute and every hour, but the trees, which have received this information, will preserve it within themselves 
every moment. The Souls of the relatives of your family line will sense this. And they’ll live in your homestead in the trees, the blades of grass and the flowers. The rays 
emanating from the trees are much weaker than those coming from people, but they are more constant. The Souls will sense this, and at first the Soul of the closest relative 
you’ve recalled will come to this spot, and after it comes, others will also gradually be drawn to this spot, too.</p><p>“In nine years, there will grow up a grove of trees that 
were planted by the person, and these will be extraordinary trees. They will possess colossal, beneficial energy. No one will be able to sense this energy’s benefits – no one 
except the gatherer of the family line himself and his close relatives.</p><p>“Imagine, Vladimir, what an extraordinary and kind thing it is that man will accomplish! He, like unto 
the Creator, will gather together anew his family line that had scattered through time.”</p><p>“But Anastasia, you said that the Souls are an energetic complex and that when people 
die, some of them disintegrate into particles and give their energy to various bugs and plants and animals.”</p><p>“Yes, I did say that, Vladimir. This happens when, during its life 
on earth, this energetic complex – the human Soul – is in disharmony with the surrounding environment to such an extent that it represents a danger to earthly existence. The 
Souls of the deceased preserve the complete complex when the imbalance has not yet reached a critical point. The more harmonious ones are the first to incarnate into earthly 
bodies. Unfortunately, there are fewer and fewer of them all the time within the Universal space, and the program is now choosing from the best of a bad lot.”</p><p>“But what if all 
the Souls of my family line have disintegrated into particles? Then will none of them come to the family grove I plant?”</p><p>“Since you exist, Vladimir, that means that your 
family chain has not been broken, either.”</p><p>“But what happens when a person is buried on the family homestead?”</p><p>“When a person’s body is buried on the homestead he himself 
established, his Soul does not fly off into the Universal darkness. It remains on the family homestead – after all, it is there that the person planted trees and communed 
with the land. The Soul, which cannot see or hear anything, but can feel, will sense the warmth that the plants give it, and besides that, the people – this person’s 
descendants – will recall him more often as they come into contact with what he created.”</p><p>“Anastasia, I know of one instance when the little old mother of some people I know 
came to their homestead to visit them. She was a little over eighty years old. She’d just come to visit for a few days. She’d come to visit her daughter, just to see what in 
the world she and her husband had cooked up. Then she asked them to let her stay forever. And she stayed. She’d spend a long time sitting on a little bench. Sometimes she’d 
walk through the homestead’s little forest, and one day she said to her daughter and son-in-law, ‘When I die, please don’t take me off to the cemetery. Bury me here.’ And she 
pointed out the spot she herself had picked out. When this elderly woman died, the daughter and son-in-law carried out her request. What will happen to this elderly woman’s 
Soul, if she didn’t manage to plant anything on this homestead?”</p><p>“Her Soul will remain on the family homestead, even if all she did was sit on a little bench. She herself 
decided she wanted to be buried there. That means she was thinking about that before she died, and her relatives will visit the spot where she was laid to rest more often 
than they would go to a cemetery, and they will think of her more often.</p><p>“You must not bury a person on a family homestead against his will, even if he has done something 
there. If that happens, it is essential to ask the person’s forgiveness, to go to the spot where he is buried and mentally explain to him why that was done, and ask for his 
help.”</p><p>“Yes, Anastasia, it’s an interesting situation. But way back when, did people know about this? Did they understand it?”</p><p>“Of course they knew, Vladimir. Even in the not 
so distant past many people had family crypts. You know about that. But in earlier periods of human existence, cemeteries didn’t exist at all. They came into existence when 
people appeared who had no family land at all: artisans in cities, domestics, various servants, and soldiers for hire. When they died, they needed to be buried, and so they’d 
carry their bodies off and toss them without their family members into the latrine pits where they’d throw sick animals. Or they’d bury them in common graves. A bit later on, 
when the cities grew larger and many various families lived in them, including well-to-do ones, then cemeteries began to appear. Well-to-do people would buy up small plots of 
land where they would bury their deceased relatives, and then other people would do the same nearby. As a result, cemeteries began to be divided up into – to put it in modern 
language – into upper class, middle class, and ordinary ones, for servants.”</p><p>“Those kinds of cemeteries still exist today: if you want to get into Vagankovo Cemetery in 
Moscow, you’ll need to bring a lot of money and effort to bear to get a good plot, and the plots are assigned by a special burial committee.”</p><p> <div class=chapter id=1017>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>17. Four Words from the Universal Law</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“Anastasia, 
what about those four words from the Universal law, the words Dark-haired referred to, the ones that define the life’s purpose of each individual man and of all mankind as a 
whole – do you know what they are?”</p><p>“Yes, Vladimir, I know these four words, those that define the common task facing mankind.”</p><p>“Can you utter them for me now?”</p><p>“I can.”</p><p>“Then 
utter them.”</p><p>Anastasia rose to her feet and, painstakingly speaking each word, said:</p><p>“PERFECT THE DWELLING LAND.”</p><p>“And that’s it?” I said, disappointed.</p><p>“Yes, that’s it.”</p><p>“To be 
perfectly honest, I thought they’d be some unusual, magic words.”</p><p>“These are unusual, magic words from the Universal law. These are the most important words of all the Divine 
programs. With their help, it is possible to determine the degree to which both an individual person and mankind as a whole are necessary for the Universe. With their help it 
is possible to determine the usefulness or uselessness of the earthly laws conceived by people.</p><p>“Perfect the dwelling land means perfect yourself.</p><p>“All that exists within the 
Universe and on Earth represents through itself a united dwelling land, inseparably interconnected, and with man in the center.</p><p>“Perfect the dwelling land means give birth to 
and raise children who are more perfected than you yourself. Each generation should be more perfected than the previous. For this to come about, the generation that comes 
before should present the following generation with a more perfected dwelling land.</p><p>“In perfecting the dwelling land, man perfects his own thought. The perfected dwelling land 
quickens and refines man’s thought.</p><p>“In perfecting the dwelling land, man comes to know immortality.</p><p>“In perfecting the dwelling land, man turns the Earth into the most 
perfected planet of the Universe.</p><p>“Earthly perfection permits and helps man to perfect other planets of the Universe.</p><p>“Universal perfection permits and helps man to create new 
worlds.</p><p>“‘Where is the edge of the Universe? What will I do when I come to it? When I have filled everything with myself, when I create that which I have thought?’ a man of 
the wellspring people asks God. And replied to His son: “My son, The Universe is thought. A dream was born of the thought, and it is partially visible as matter. When you 
come to the edge of everything, a new beginning and continuation shall your thought discover. Out of nothing will arise the new, beautiful birth of you, and of the 
aspiration, reflecting in itself your Soul and your dream. My son, you are endless, you are eternal, your creating dreams are within you.”</p><p>Anastasia fell silent. Astounded by 
the unusual intonations and by the meaning of the words she’d uttered, I kept on looking at her. And with complete clarity, I suddenly realized: she isn’t simply a taiga 
hermit living in the Siberian taiga. Not simply an extraordinarily beautiful woman.</p><p>Anastasia is a person from another dimension, a dimension where human Intelligence 
triumphs. She senses and sees this dimension of intelligence. She is worthy of it. Of a dimension in which a perfected, happy creator-man makes the planet Earth the most 
beautiful planet in the Universe. And the planets of the whole Universe, delighted by his earthly creations, call to him to contemplate them, too. To touch their surface ever 
so lightly, even with just their hand and, through a smile, give them a future. And how unbearably painful it must be for her to look at today’s earthly bacchanal.</p><p>But she 
gave birth to two children, and wasn’t put off by the danger that the anti-rationality that rules today would swallow up the children. That means she’s convinced that 
everything will change on its own – or that she’ll change it herself.</p><p>“Anastasia, given your world view, isn’t it painful for you to look at today’s reality?”</p><p>“Very painful, 
Vladimir,” Anastasia whispered.</p><p>“Then how do you bear such pain?”</p><p>“By creating pictures of a beautiful future, admiring them and delighting in them. The joy of beholding them 
vanquishes the pain. And what’s more, there is even more benefit from such beholding: the way you imagine the future to be, is the way it will come to pass.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1018>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>18. The Dimension of Anti-Rationality</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div> </p><p>“Anastasia, can it really be that modern mankind actually does live in the dimension of anti-rationality that the dark-haired youth mentioned? And 
what exactly is anti-rationality? How can we see this in real life?”</p><p>“Thought or information appears, and we need to assess its reality only through ourselves.”</p><p>“But how can we 
assess it, by what means? If a person is living in the anti-rational dimension, then he’ll think in the categories of anti-rationality.”</p><p>“Yes, that is so. But rationality all 
the same remains within a person, although in a significantly smaller degree.</p><p>“And if you mentally appeal to it, it is activated, and then you can use it to help you identify 
anti-rational manifestations. For now, we will speak no more on this topic, Vladimir. For now, go take a stroll here around the glade, around the taiga and reflect a bit. 
Here, in this spot, Rationality and anti-rationality are in balance. But in you they are not, and for that reason, help your rationality out – activate it from time to 
time.”</p><p>“How do I activate it?”</p><p>“Just mentally say within you: ‘Rationality.’ Or better yet, ‘Raaatio-naaal–iii-ty.’”</p><p>I was left alone and tried to reflect from a position of 
Rationality. And these are the conclusions I began to draw.</p><p>************************ The Artificial World ************************</p><p>Today’s community of people lives in an 
artificial world, not a natural one.</p><p>It created it and slavishly serves it.</p><p>We have created an artificial world and live artificial lives within in.</p><p>The real, natural world is 
to be found along the side of the asphalt roadways along which modern mankind is rushing headlong toward an abyss.</p><p>Artificial concepts have been implanted into the collective 
consciousness of modern people.</p><p>Our scientists and “educated” researchers have, in their great wisdom, started to call modern medicine – which has existed for only two hundred 
years – traditional, while calling folk medicine – whose history is calculated in the hundreds of thousands of years – non-traditional. At the same time as they’ve begun 
referring to healers – and here I’m talking about real healers, who are well versed in the properties of medicinal plants – as charlatans. The result is that modern man ends 
up having to treat many diseases – ones that people just a hundred years ago easily cured themselves of, at no cost, using herbs from their very own garden – using expensive 
pharmaceuticals, on the advice of their doctor. Perhaps there should be two paths in medicine. We need to teach folk medicine in school and train specialists in medical 
schools. Eighty percent of ailments can be cured using folk medicine, and this will significantly lower the burden on today’s medical facilities, which will make it possible 
to substantially improve the quality of medical service. But to do this we have to think in categories of Rationality.</p><p>************************ Artificial Plumbing Systems 
************************</p><p>Mankind has buried millions of kilometers of metal pipes that they call plumbing systems in the ground. Colossal effort has been expended to 
manufacture these pipes and lay them in trenches. They require continual servicing and major overhauls, which come at the cost of people’s hard labor. Meanwhile, the water 
that comes out of the faucets in our apartments ends up being unfit to drink. And besides that, we have a natural plumbing system in the natural world – by which I mean not 
just rivers, but groundwater aquifers as well. Living, healing water capable of filling millions of wells flow through the Earth’s veins there. The natural plumbing system 
requires no repairs. But what’s more, it’s capable of purifying polluted surface water and of saturating a vital product with minerals and other necessary substances. But the 
city person’s modern way of life has deprived him of the opportunity to utilize the natural plumbing system that was designed and constructed by the Creator.</p><p>The question 
arises: did man choose this way of life on his own, or under the influence of certain forces? In order to answer this question, let’s take a look at one more case. We’d be 
hard pressed to call it anything other than the mental illness of a society. What steps must the average family in Europe, America or Russia take in order to acquire their 
own apartment or home?</p><p>************************ The Anti-Rationality Mortgage ************************</p><p>For example, they’re advised to take out a mortgage. Or, more precisely, 
they’re advised to take out a loan from a bank for a period of twenty or thirty years, acquire a modest residence with the bank’s money and then, every month over the course 
of twenty years, pay the money back to the bank, with interest. If the family isn’t able to pay the money back, the apartment will be taken away. A young family has to spend 
twenty years living in fear of losing their residence and – as a rule – work at a job they don’t like, just so they can get paid more. Grovel at their boss’s feet out of fear 
of losing their job. But perhaps there’s no alternative to this kind of disconcerting situation? But there is! And that’s not all – the alternative actually shows that 
obstacles that stand in the way of young people acquiring housing have been artificially implanted into their young heads. These obstacles are virtual, and intrinsic only to 
virtual reality. I’ll give you a totally typical, real life example.</p><p>A young man named Andrei lived in the city of Vladimir, and on the outside, he didn’t look much different 
from his peers. He went to cafes and discos; he smoked and used alcohol. When he read about family homesteads, he began dreaming of his own land and home.</p><p>He didn’t have the 
funds to buy a plot of land and build a house, and his parents weren’t in a position to offer him financial help. In 2001, a hectare14 of land on a deserted spot overgrown 
with tall grasses near the village of Konyaevo, thirty kilometers from the city of Vladimir, cost thirty thousand rubles15. Nearly fifty families from among my readers have 
acquired their own hectares in this deserted spot and begun putting up structures. People mostly in their middle years, who possessed some financial reserves. Andrei also 
took a liking to this spot on the bank of a forest lake, and there was still some free land left there. Driven by his dream of having his own homestead, he stopped 
frequenting the youth club scene and, by working hard, was able to save up thirty thousand rubes in the space of only six months and acquire a hectare of land in the deserted 
spot. But where could he get the money to build a home? At that time in the city of Vladimir, a square meter of housing cost twenty thousand rubles, and thus, to build a home 
only fifty square meters in size, he’d need an additional million rubles. Andrei wasn’t about to take out a loan from a bank, just so he’d then have to spend twenty years 
paying it back with interest. At the age of twenty-three, the young man went to the store, bought a good axe, and in the course of a year, all on his own, put up a wooden 
home on his plot. That’s making a long story short. Here’s some more detail. First, Andrei got a job in a company where there were master craftsmen who knew how to frame a 
log house. From them he learned how to work with wood, while simultaneously earning the money to buy the logs for his future home. On this young man’s plot, a garden is now 
growing, a well has been dug, there’s a pond, and there’s a wooden home, and people who are new arrivals to the settlement put themselves on the waiting list for him to build 
them log homes. Now Andrei is an acclaimed and respected master craftsman.</p><p>You could say that through his own actions, Andrei saved a million rubles. Or that he earned them. I 
think that’s not even important. He gained immeasurably more than a million – he gained confidence in his own abilities, and a home built with his very own hands.</p><p>I think 
Andrei will manage to find a worthy girl who will enter this home and bear him a son and daughter, and the children will tell their grandchildren who it was who built the 
home with his very own hands, who put in the garden, who established their small motherland.</p><p>Andrei’s story isn’t the only one of its kind. In that same settlement, there are 
other families who have built their homes with their own hands.</p><p>I remember how my father and grandfather also put up their own wooden home, and the neighbors next to them, my 
parents’ peers, did the same thing. More than half a century has passed, but people still live in these houses, just as they did back then.</p><p>And this is where questions come 
up. How could it happen, that for half a century, society has been developing new building techniques, new materials, machinery and devices which would seem to be more 
advanced, but in the end…</p><p>The average family has to work hard for twenty to thirty years to get a dwelling that it used to be able to provide itself with in the course of a 
year or two. For many families, the housing question has become insoluble, and the government has had to take it up.</p><p>Did the given situation come about by chance, or did 
someone artificially construct it? That, however, isn’t important. The important thing is that the situation is absolutely anti-rational, but society, caught up in its 
everyday bustle, has turned out to be incapable of reflecting and analyzing. It’s gotten used to the situation and can’t imagine anything different. Society has gotten used 
to anti-rationality. And is ceasing to be rational.</p><p>************************ Why Does Love Go Away? ************************</p><p>Man’s modern way of life has given birth to a great 
many problems that we are strictly forbidden to discuss, and since they don’t get discussed, they don’t get solved, either.</p><p>Billions of domestic conflicts take place all over 
the world, and they can get to the point where spouses fight with and murder each other. In so-called civilized countries, up to eighty percent of young people who enter into 
marriage divorce soon afterward. This process is preceded by negative emotions and stress of long standing, and children are made unhappy.</p><p>Over the course of millennia, 
millions of localized wars have been going on practically all over the world between people who have attempted to establish a loving union. It isn’t only both sides in these 
battles that take the cruelest of beatings, but their children, too.</p><p>This kind of situation has been presented to modern mankind as a given. It’s natural, they tell us – love 
comes and goes. But as it turns out, this kind of situation is characteristic only for people of the artificial world. It is not consistent with man’s true nature.</p><p>For the 
first time ever, the taiga hermit has shown that young people’s initial attraction for each other is not love – it is but the urge to give birth to the great feeling which 
arises when three components are united.</p><p>She identified these components and showed us three ancient rites that help real love be born. I have included them in previous books. 
I had to use the word ‘rite’ because Russian lacks a more precise definition that expresses these rational acts by young people who feel attracted to each other, and their 
parents.</p><p>But the given topic, like many others, turned out to be forbidden for the mass media. And that’s not all – they began, using plausible pretexts, to make efforts to 
slander the source. It got to the point that on a show called “The Mysterious Anastasia” on Russian Central Television’s Channel One, certain individuals began collectively 
declaring that people were going crazy from reading my books with the statements of the taiga hermit. Ludicrous! They don’t go crazy from reading porn magazines or bloody 
thrillers or watching movies about violence, but they do from reading philosophical statements about love and man’s way of life? This position makes it clear that there are 
forces in modern society that program social disasters. They target people and act through them, making use of their ignorance about what’s really going on.</p><p>And we can 
understand these people. Imagine what would happen if a person who’s read the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” book series starts asserting that by using three ancient rites, 
modern newlyweds can, during their marriage ceremony, in the space of thirty minutes and in plain view of all their relatives, create a family homestead on a deserted spot, 
along with a garden that will contain around a hundred plantings necessary for the family’s sustenance. That they can erect a home with all the necessary farmyard structures, 
along with devoted animals that seem to have been settled in them as if by magic. Modern people who haven’t read the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” book series might consider a 
person who asserts this fact crazy or gullible. But allow me to reveal a bit about this mechanism, the mechanism with whose help the given “miracles” really do take occur.</p><p>According to ancient rules or rites – you can call them what you want – a pair of young people who feel drawn to each other go out to the outskirts of the settlement, find 
themselves a plot of land no less than a hectare in size and build a small hut there. Together, they create a detailed and thorough design for their future homestead. For all 
intents and purposes, they are also creating a space where the energy of love can be found. In their design, they indicate not only the spots where their future home and 
farmyard structures will be located, but also where absolutely all the plantings will go.</p><p>Doing everything to create the design can keep them busy for anywhere from three 
months up to a year. Once the design is finished, they go around to all their relatives – on both the side of the bride and the groom – and invite them to participate in the 
rite of marriage. And each time they’re at the home of this or that relative, they say, for example, “Ah, what a beautiful apple tree you have there.” These words serve as a 
hint to the invited guest about what he should bring with him to the rite of marriage. In this particular case, a slip of the apple tree that the future newlyweds liked. To 
someone else they’re inviting they might say, for example, “What a feisty little coat you have there.” That means that the guest doesn’t need to think about what gift to 
bring the young couple – he’ll give them a colt. And so on.</p><p>During the rite of marriage, the newlyweds will tell their relatives and friends – as if they were taking some kind 
of great exam of life in their presence –all about the design they’ve created for their homestead, indicating in detail where everything should be located. Once they’ve 
finished the telling, they will give a signal, and the relatives and friends who have gathered together will set out their living gifts in precisely the spots indicated by 
the wedded couple. The newlyweds, all aquiver, will observe as their closet relatives and friends engage in the great joint action. Then the now-married young couple, having 
experienced great inspiration and emotional elevation, will be led away, each to his parents’ home, where they will spend two nights. In the space of this time, the relatives 
on the side of the bride and groom will move previously readied structures to the spot, piece by piece. At dawn on the second day, he and she will hurry to their newly 
created family homestead, to their first meeting as husband and wife. It is impossible to describe what will pass between them in their new home, full of nothing but positive 
emotions and an inspired, never before experienced, energy of love for each other and for their newly created space of love.</p><p>What would have happened if the wellspring people 
had told such newlyweds that there will come a time when marriage will be carried out in an entirely different way? That two young people will come to some building, sign 
their names in some ledger and ride around in someone else’s car that’s been decorated with ribbons, all around a city that doesn’t and never will belong to them. After that, 
along with their invited guests, they will take their seats at a table in some restaurant and eat food that wasn’t prepared by their hands or by their relatives’ hands, and 
drink vodka, and that the then tipsy guests and relatives will shout “bitter-bitter” to them, demanding that they kiss each other in front of everyone. And that’s it. Next 
comes the so-called marriage bed and the lack of any pleasant after-effects from what has transpired. And what’s more, any space that the energy of love can fill is totally 
lacking.</p><p>“Such a thing couldn’t happen! It could never happen!” the wellspring people newlyweds will say. “Man is a rational being, not a crazed animal who would destroy love 
like that, love that is just an embryo and hasn’t yet grown strong.”</p><p>So, who is it who’s really going crazy? Judge for yourselves, esteemed readers.</p><p>To answer the question of 
why love goes away, we can say that real, full-fledged love simply doesn’t come to the majority of modern newlyweds, because there’s no appropriate space for it.</p><p>What is love? 
It is a feeling, a great energy, that is capable of inspiring a person to create and that increases his spiritual powers and capabilities. It is a rational energy – it fills 
the space where two people in love are present and creates a unified whole for them, a space of love. Take a look at what happens nowadays. The newlyweds go to the marriage 
bureau to formalize their marriage. The marriage bureau facility isn’t their space, but simple a temporary spot where they’re spending some time, and what’s more, divorce 
proceedings take place in this very same facility. And the rational energy of love is unable to fill a space like that.</p><p>Riding around in a car, often someone else’s, also 
isn’t fitting for the energy of love. And it can’t fill a modern apartment, either. Because after all, the energy of love can’t caress soulless, dying objects, and in a 
modern apartment, even in a very new one, everything is aging and disintegrating with each instant. Nothing is coming to life in it, and the energy of love can’t make its 
peace with that kind of disintegration. When it’s present in that kind of situation, it can’t give its blessing.</p><p>What’s needed for the energy of love is a living space that’s 
been established by people – in the given case, by actual people who feel drawn to each other. It can’t be any other way. The proof of this is the great number of secular 
divorce proceedings throughout the world.</p><p>The question of why love goes away deserves to be studied from all angles, and I intend to devote my next book to this, a book in 
which I will tell of the ancient land where people knew the secret of ever-lasting love. Today’s approach to love is truly anti-rational.</p><p>************************ Governing 
the Government ************************</p><p>There are various methods one can use to influence people – we’re not excluding the government here, either. And the most potent among 
them is the image. People grow accustomed to absurd conditions and images and accept them as givens. There’s an image that tells us that the government, including the State 
Duma, too, where laws are developed and enacted, must definitely be located in the center of a big city. We’ve gotten accustomed to it being this way. But does this make 
sense?</p><p>Where did the prophets receive their revelations? And where did the wise men do their reflecting? Whence did they bring us the Divine laws?</p><p>Moses. He received the tables 
with the “ten commandments” after going into seclusion on Mount Sinai. Christ. He went off into the desert for forty days. Buddha. He spent several years deep in the forest. 
Mohammad. He spent months in seclusion in the cave of Hira on the mountain Jabal al-Nour.</p><p>Philosophers and scholars – Confucius, Lao-Tzu, Kant and Nietzsche and many others – 
have also spent years living in seclusion.</p><p>But where is our State Duma’s building located? Where do they write our laws, these wise men chosen by the people? Do you recall?</p><p>Our 
State Duma’s building is located at the intersection of busy highways – could we possibly create more absurd working conditions for our national chose ones?</p><p>What do we have 
here – a roadside Duma?!</p><p>************************ What Causes Empires to Die Out ************************</p><p>I can cite a great many historical examples of images influencing 
human society and inducing planetary disasters. But for the contemporary person, particularly one living in Russia, the most obvious example will be the situation connected 
to the demise of Tsarist Russia and, later on, the fall of the USSR.</p><p>“From a spark a flame will burst forth,” said the leader of the worldwide proletariat, V.I. Lenin, 
speaking of the Bolshevik newspaper “Spark,” in which the Tsarist regime was smeared. All according to plan, a negative image of Tsarist rule took root, and a new, beautiful 
image was created, an image of Soviet rule. Tsarism was toppled. A new empire – the USSR – arose and began developing, an empire possessing a huge army and equipped with 
nuclear weapons.</p><p>But only seventy years later, the great empire of the USSR collapsed into several separate states, ones not always inclined to be friendly to each other. It 
was the politicians who had signed the agreement concerning the division, as well as the economic and political situation, that political scientists identified as the 
culprits in the collapse.</p><p>When we take a closer look, we can see all of this, too, as simply the result of the action of images. Let’s recall Solzhenitsyn’s gifted books about 
the GULAG and the works of other masters of the pen who smeared the USSR. Other writers at the same time were creating an image of the prospering Western states where, unlike 
in the USSR, store shelves were groaning beneath an abundance of all possible products and happy and free people were riding around in fancy cars. And at the same time as 
they were speaking of the merits of Western civilization, they remained silent about the problems existing there.</p><p>Russia’s future is also defined using images that are taking 
root in the minds and souls of the people living in the country. Unfortunately, this is a whole pleiad of images that are leading toward the annihilation of the state. The 
cult of violence and the cult of money are forming the image of destruction in thousands of movies in theaters and on television. “Catching up to the West.” That’s what many 
of our politicians are propagandizing. No economic or military achievements and no calls to be patriots in our motherland are capable of opposing these images.</p><p>The only thing 
that can oppose this image is a different image, an image of creation, an image capable of inspiring millions of people. And Anastasia has created it as a counterweight to 
the armadas of destructive images. Hundreds of thousands of people have taken up the image of a beautiful, future country and have contributed their own ideas to it and have 
begun making it a reality – they’ve begun building family homesteads. This grass roots initiative was in line with the government’s plans. Many well-known politicians, 
government figures, well-known academics, cultural figures and religious leaders have made positive statements about those who are building family homesteads. I’m not going 
to bring in their statements here, but anyone who wishes to do so can learn about them on the site Anastasia.ru.</p><p>Now, of course, these statements have inspired people, but 
they are nominally off-the-record, although they’re also infinitely bold. After all, these rational words have resounded within the landscape of anti-rationality and 
penetrated it.</p><p>Some of the taiga hermit’s assertions might seem fantastical, and that’s the way they seemed to me, too, when I first started spending time with her. Now, 
fifteen years after my first meeting with her, there’s much I’ve had to rethink. It’s we, contemporary society, who live in a dwelling land that is fantastically unnatural 
for living a rational life. Anastasia speaks about rational reality. She is establishing it, methodically, and she will establish it. I will try to help her, and hundreds of 
thousands of people are already helping.</p><p>And here’s what else is interesting. In electronic and print media, literature and the movies, there are practically no positive 
heroes who commune with the earth in a rational fashion. Call to mind the way of life and dwelling land of any main characters. For the most part, they’re shown in 
apartments, offices, restaurants, casinos, on the streets of big cities and in places like that. And if they do show a person who communes with the earth in a conscious way – 
and this happens extremely rarely – then this person is presented as immature, as an imbecile. Human society is methodically and persistently being indoctrinated about the 
kind of dwelling land where he should pass his life. Did this situation come about by chance? I think, and I am even convinced, that it did not come about by chance. It is 
leading us toward a disaster – a personal, social and planetary disaster.</p><p>When I was talking with Anastasia later on, after I’d done some thinking on my own, I said, with 
certainty:</p><p>“I am absolutely convinced that contemporary mankind is living in the dimension of anti-rationality. It thinks in the categories of anti-rationality, because it has 
no clear plans for how to construct a harmonious future. All it does is state the obvious – the fact that it is coming to an end – and speak about that.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1019>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>19. The Year 2012</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>These 
days, the date of December 22, 2012 is being widely and actively discussed, both in esoteric circles and among scholars, and on the Internet. Many people believe that the 
world will come to an end on that day.</p><p>Why are people talking specifically about this date? It’s because this date is connected to a gloomy, apocalyptic prediction by the 
enigmatic ancient Mayans, according to whose calendar – and, by the way, experts admit that the Mayan calendar is much more precise than the Gregorian calendar we now use – 
on this day, on December 22, 2012, the current cycle of the so-called long count, the Era of the Fifth Sun, or the Epoch of the Jaguar, will come to an end. According to 
legend, the conclusion of Epoch of the Jaguar will be followed by years of death and destruction that will continue until the epoch of the renewal of mankind begins.</p><p>Scholars 
recently ascertained that the date indicated in the Mayan calendar is significant astronomically. On this day an event will occur that takes place only once every 25,800 
years: the Sun will come into alignment with the mystical energetic center of the Galaxy, and modern civilization will, for the first time, live through this rare 
astronomical phenomenon. Or it won’t live through it.</p><p>It has been suggested that during the second millennium B.C.E., the Mayan forbears, whose monuments we encounter in 
Central America, came down from the mountains where they’d been living into the tropical forests and plains of the Yucatan. It is precisely on the plains that the Mayan 
civilization achieved its greatest flowering, in the first millennium B.C.E. The Mayans knew how to write in hieroglyphs, and their math and medicine were at a very high 
level. They built stone cities and unbelievable ceremonial structures, such as the Great Palace at Palenque, and – here’s the main thing – they had a deep knowledge of 
astronomy.</p><p>Up to the present day, no complete explanation has been found for the fact that the Mayan cities began to fall into disrepair long before the Europeans arrived.</p><p>At 
the heart of the Mayan civilization’s astrology lies the Count of Days. The basis for generally accepted astrology (of Ancient Sumer and Babylon) is the arrangement of the 
planets around the zodiac circle. The Mayans also knew the zodiac constellations, but their Zodiac had 13 constellations, not 12. They included the constellation Serpentarius 
(which the Mayans called the Bat,) through which the Sun passes for only a few days.</p><p>Now about the enigmatic calendar. The current cycle of time, which comes to an end in the 
year 2012, is measured starting from a very ancient date: the 13th of August in the year 3114 B.C.E. And this is rather strange, because, as I’ve already noted, the culture 
of the Mayans themselves is a minimum of a thousand years younger than that. Experts who study Mayan culture have not been able to reach consensus about how their famous 
calendar came into being. It’s been suggested that the Mayans acquired the calendar – along with their written language – from the Olmecs, whose culture has a more ancient 
history. And actually, archaeologists have made finds on the territory of the ancient Olmecs’ settlement at La Venta that confirm a certain continuity or interconnection 
between those cultures. But what’s more interesting is something else.</p><p>When scholars took a look at comparative chronology, then it became clear that certain momentous events 
from the past of human civilization fully coincide with the beginning of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar, the 3114th year B.C.E.. Thus, it is roughly at this time 
that the mysterious megalithic structure of Stonehenge begins to be constructed. Written language appears in Mesopotamia. In Egypt, following the unification of the Upper and 
lower Kingdoms and the founding of the fortress of the White Wall (Memphis in Greek,) ruling dynasties are formed. In America they begin cultivating maize. One gets the 
impression that precisely at that time, a global cultural revolution took place across the whole planet and that people acquired new knowledge, under the influence of certain 
external forces. According to one of the theories, priests, shamans and holy men of that time came into contact with some repository of secret knowledge during their 
meditations.</p><p>Of course, the predictions of the Mayan culture, the well-known prophesies and official sources that speak of a planetary disaster are worthy of attention. Even 
so, it’s each thinking person alive today who can make the most important and reliable reckoning about the future.</p><p>Let’s try to analyze in what direction changes in the 
ecological situation in Russia are tending.</p><p>Let’s take the time span of just the last fifty years. The majority of the country’s population began living in big and middle-
sized cities. People in the big cities have ended up without good quality drinking water. As if that weren’t enough, people have started having to pay for their most life-
sustaining product. Fifty years ago, a situation like this would have seemed simply fantastical to society. Today society has gotten used to it. And it shouldn’t have done 
so. Water is a requirement for everything, and if society agrees to the ever greater pollution of water, then it does not have the right to exist. It isn’t someone up on high 
who’s sentencing man to this, but man himself.</p><p>************************ "I'm Cancelling the Predicted Hell on Earth" ************************</p><p>This phrase was uttered by the 
taiga hermit Anastasia. I think it’s useful for the majority of people living on Earth to utter similar words and to perform acts that correspond to these words. Today this 
is a matter of life and death.</p><p>Many people living on the planet Earth are taking note of the negative results of global warming. Scientists are spreading the word about 
changes in the Earth’s geomagnetic field and about the flooding of entire continents in the not-so-distant future. Such large-scale disasters have begun occurring right 
before our contemporaries’ very eyes, like the one in Indonesia, where more than two hundred thousand people perished, and in the USA, where New Orleans, a city with a 
population of a million, was flooded. Scientists are also spreading the word about impending changes in the Sun’s activity.</p><p>Questions about the ecological safety of the Earth 
have arisen so keenly that they were included in the UN agenda in 2007, at England’s initiative. At the beginning of 2008, they were considered by Russia’s Security Council.</p><p>For the first time, assertions by those forecasting a global disaster began to dovetail with the way contemporary scientists and the leadership of many states viewed this 
topic.</p><p>The priests of the Mayan civilization also spoke about how a global disaster would occur, and that it would take place in 2012.</p><p>Many people have heard about this to one 
degree or another, but even so, public conversations about the 2012 disaster touch on only a small portion of what is spoken about in talks behind closed doors.</p><p>It’s only by 
hearsay that we can guess that the Japanese government is taking steps to resettle its population. According to the forecasts, England will be one of the first to be flooded 
and, evidently, that’s why it was the one to initiate the inclusion of ecological questions in the agenda for the meeting of the UN Security Council.</p><p>It’s possible that the 
governments of various countries are acting correctly by not publicizing the current situation widely and in detail. Why sow panic in the people? But on the other hand, the 
majority of a population might perish because they’re out of the loop, and if that’s the case, then only the informed elite would be able to save themselves, taking one or 
two hundred slaves each along with them.</p><p>Scientists are making predictions about which countries will be swallowed up by the elements, the way Atlantis was, and which ones 
won’t be subject to flooding. In Russia, for example, the coastal regions will be flooded, and Siberia will end up being the best place to live.</p><p>Following global warming on 
the Earth, an ice age will ensue.</p><p>But what difference does it even make what kind of global disaster comes about, if society is in no condition to withstand the disastrous 
phenomena we already have today, such as the fumes that contaminate the air in the cities, the electromagnetic radiation that penetrates our dwellings, and many others?</p><p>Is 
there an alternative to mankind’s sad future? Of course, there is. But all in good time.</p><p>And so, at world forums, they’ve come to a clear conclusion: it’s possible that a 
disaster will occur in coming years. And so here’s where an interesting question arises: are leaders, the wealthy, and science capable of taking some kind of measures to 
avert it? Representatives of global science have been unable to answer this question. The governments of various countries, in an effort to affect the situation in some way, 
developed the so-called Kyoto Protocol, according to which all countries would be required to reduce harmful emissions into the atmosphere. Thus far, the protocol has 
remained unratified by many countries.</p><p>What might happen in the future does, of course, cause us worry, but shouldn’t the disastrous situation that’s already playing out today 
– the situation masquerading as the triumph of civilization – cause us even greater worry?</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1020>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>20. The Man-eating Octopus</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>The picture that Anastasia or the dark-haired youth showed, in which people build 
their homes along the stinking tentacles of a man-eating monster is not fiction at all, but the truest reality. A reality to which people have grown so accustomed that they 
accept it as a given.</p><p>And the monster exists still and is growing in size. It is our roads and what moves along them. Information about this is available to everyone.</p><p>We know, 
for example, that the length of the world’s major paved highways exceeds 12 million kilometers, which is, for purposes of comparison, three hundred times the length of the 
Earth’s equator, which extends for approximately forty thousand kilometers. The length of air traffic routes approaches 6 million kilometers, railway tracks are 1.5 million 
kilometers long, major pipelines stretch for roughly 1.1 million kilometers, and interior waterways – for more than six hundred thousand kilometers. The length of sea lanes 
equals many millions of kilometers. If we turn to the problem of pollution of the atmosphere by various means of transportation, then automobiles’ share would make up 85 
percent! And you know, the problem here isn’t limited to harmful gases. We shouldn’t forget about such unfavorable ecological factors as noise and vibration. So, 80 decibels 
– which is about the noise level on a busy city street – already has the potential to harm one’s hearing. And the development of various means of transportation and the 
laying down of highways doesn’t promote psychological health, either. And here, too, these factors directly or indirectly affect not only drivers and passengers, but also the 
many people who are outside the means of transportation and communications lines. Crammed roads, sitting for many hours in traffic jams, the fact that sometimes it’s 
impossible even to simply cross the road – all of this sharply heightens nervousness, leads to chronic stress and increased aggression and sometimes drives people to acts 
they not only never would have committed, but couldn’t even imagine themselves capable of committing, had they been in some other place.</p><p>Yearly surveys of the condition of the 
natural environment in the various regions of our country eloquently express the acute nature of the problem of the ecological safety of all Russian big cities without 
exception. And experts unanimously recognize “the intensifying process of the automobilization of society” as the fundamental reason that the regions’ level of ecological 
safety has decreased. Even now, medical personnel are already testifying that “ecological stress” caused by the automotive and transportation system costs the average 
resident of a large city in Russia 4 to 5 years of his life. Here we’re talking about people and a person, after all, can not only perceive a problem, but articulate it, too. 
But what about the Earth, for example? Although the Earth can also articulate a problem, too, in its own way. It’s just that amidst the noise and clatter and fumes of ours 
lives, are we still capable of hearing the Earth’s voice?</p><p>What specifically is it about the automotive and transportation system that is killing the Earth? First of all, you 
need actual earth when you’re building transportation lines, just as you need water and air. In the USA, for example, there’s a statistic that the amount of land that 
highways, railways and airports occupy equals 101,000 square kilometers, while cities occupy 109,000 square kilometers. In Russia, the length of roads is greater than half a 
million kilometers.</p><p>Well, roads are built on the land – what’s the problem? The problem is that when roads, pipelines and airports are built and used, the soil is destroyed: 
you get landslides and sink holes, and erosion advances. And then you get gullies that run along the ruts in dirt roads and grow wider, which exacerbates the situation even 
more.</p><p>The further you go, the more happens: a large expanse of land alongside highways, railways and the oil and gas pipelines that come out onto the surface is polluted with 
a combination of lead, sulfur, petroleum products and other substances. Experts rank as most dangerous the strip of land that extends 200 meters outward along both sides runs 
of the busiest highways. This is the reason it is expressly prohibited to grow agricultural products, collect mushrooms and berries, and graze livestock – especially milk-
producers – along the sides of roads. (There are known cases of children being poisoned by the milk of cows that have grazed around roads.) Near roads, the layer of air near 
the ground, up to a meter above the surface, is also devastatingly polluted with dust consisting of particles of asphalt, rubber and metal. You’ll find lead in it, along with 
other substances that possess carcinogenic and mutagenic functions. Those who are fond of taking a stroll or jogging along the roadside should give this some thought, and one 
should be particularly mindful of this when taking walks with little children – after all, when they’re in a stroller or are walking, they’re passing right through this 
hazardous zone.</p><p>And here’s something else I’d like to add. Please note that the greatest number of harmful roadways is concentrated not in the desert or in Antarctica, but in 
places with the greatest concentrations of people. And huge cities and metropolitan areas take pride in their killer multi-lane ring highways.</p><p>When putting their budgets 
together, all governments include major financing for constructing and repairing highways. What else could they do? After all, if there were no roads, the residents of 
metropolitan areas might be left without food and medication. Roads are the blood vessels that provide a person living in a metropolitan area with everything he needs.</p><p>Stop! 
What we’ve got here is some kind of gibberish. It truly is rampant anti-rationality. The blood vessels which – it would seem – we can’t do without, are in truth delivering to 
us a slow death.</p><p>Ah, what spiritual, well-educated and intelligent people we want to seem to be! But if we leave monsters like this to the new generation, that means we are 
handing our very own children over to it to be ripped to pieces. Who does that make us in that case?</p><p>And there seems to be no way out of the current, absurd situation. But it 
only seems that way. There is a way out. And it lies in the way we live – both the individual person and society as whole.</p><p>The exhaust gases from millions of cars, the 
smokestacks of giant and small companies and other sources that belch out harmful pollutants are but an effect, and not the cause that gave birth to them. The cause lies in 
the anti-rational, technocratic way of life.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1021>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>21. Heading of a Planetary Disaster </h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div> </p><p>Now, many people – starting with the UN and the governments of many countries and ending with 
ordinary people – are saying that we are on the brink of a planetary disaster.</p><p>There’s also talk about how human acts are the cause of the disaster.</p><p>It goes without saying that 
simply stating the fact that a calamity is approaching does nothing to head it off. We need concrete, efficacious measures that are capable of changing the situation for the 
better. But does an efficacious method for finding our way out of a crisis situation exist in nature? Yes, it does! Its “code names” are “family homestead,” “the ringing 
cedars of Russia” and “Anastasia.” These words and the images, information and philosophy that stand behind them are capable not only of leading the country out of crisis in 
very short order, but also of initiating a new phase of harmonious development in society.</p><p>So that we can understand how this might come to pass, let’s first enumerate some of 
today’s problems.</p><p>Ecology. There is not enough good quality air, pure water and healthy food in the cities.</p><p>Transportation. Traffic jams many kilometers long have become 
customary in large cities. Because of poor roads in Russia, up to thirty thousand people die in traffic accidents each year.</p><p>Corruption. There is much talk, including on the 
highest levels, about the scale of this phenomenon. A bureaucrat who embezzles from the treasury, a bribe-taker and a bribe-giver are no less dangerous than enemy saboteurs.</p><p>Unemployment. The most dangerous consequence of unemployment is depression. When this illness overcomes one person, he turns into a living corpse. If it overcomes a segment 
of society, then the state is in danger of dying out.</p><p>Drunkenness and Drug Addiction. We’ve been fighting these afflictions for a long time now, and unsuccessfully.</p><p>The Housing 
Problem. Despite all the efforts that have been brought to bear to resolve it, the situation is only getting worse.</p><p>And now, let’s imagine the following scenario:</p><p>Fifty percent 
of the population of Russia, America and Canada decides to live a healthy way of life and build a family homestead for their family on a plot of land not less than one 
hectare in size.</p><p>The governments lay the necessary legislative foundation and grant these families the necessary amount of land so they can create settlements of family 
homesteads.</p><p>On the previously abandoned lands of former collective farms, state farms and farmlands, the people who have received land begin building on an unprecedented 
scale. They build residential homes and the necessary farmyard structures. Those who lack sufficient means do the building using their own family’s labor. Those who have the 
means to do so hire construction crews.</p><p>But what’s most important is that these people, each of them on their own hectare, are planting gardens and putting in vegetable 
gardens.</p><p>Previously abandoned lands in the Far East, in Siberia and in the Central Region of Russia turn into blooming oases.</p><p>In a state that has such oases, the food problem 
is entirely solved, since families who have changed their way of life not only entirely provide for themselves with first class produce, but are also able to feed the 
population of large and smaller cities.</p><p>The threat of a collapse of the transportation system in big cities disappears. Since the quantity of cars falls by half, the air 
improves significantly. The housing problem is completely solved, since the housing that has been freed up is granted to all who need it. Unemployment entirely disappears, 
and the government need not worry about what will happen when unprofitable businesses shut down.</p><p>Social tension in society falls sharply. Stratification into poor and rich no 
longer elicits rage and envy in most people. People have found more important priorities than how much money one has.</p><p>Consciously communing with the land opens up such 
possibilities and horizons for man that the technocratic mind can’t imagine them, not even in science fiction films. For this reason, I believe that all of us, all together, 
need to try to fathom what lies at the heart of the secret of this communing.</p><p>Changing the way a significant portion of the population lives will eliminate the possibility of 
an ecological disaster on a planetary scale.</p><p>Some might say that what we have here is a very rosy and fantastical picture of the future. How can a significant portion of the 
population suddenly experience the inspired desire to begin living a healthy way of life? To build family homesteads by acquiring some land that’s overgrown with tall weeds, 
and pay for it themselves to boot? And all thanks to some code names and phrases. That’s not realistic. That’s a fairy tale.</p><p>I’ll tell you right off, there’s no problem where 
this question is concerned. The words and phrases are efficacious. Tens of people are showing us this in practice. In Russia there are already more than fifteen hundred 
settlements of family homesteads that have been set up by readers of the books in the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series. There are the same kind of settlements in Ukraine, 
Belarus and Kazakhstan.</p><p>But what is fantastical, from the point of view of Rationality, is that government agencies have not aided these people enough and have, in some cases, 
opposed this beautiful aspiration.</p><p>A chorus of voices on the international and regional levels is calling for measures to be taken to head off a planetary disaster. But the 
only people who are really taking actions aimed at heading off social and ecological disruptions are the people who are building family homesteads.</p><p>More than a year ago an 
idea was born: for each person who has founded a family homestead and who is planning to found one to declare his intentions and aspirations. The first time I read a draft of 
a declaration like this out loud was at a gathering in one of the settlements. The idea was picked up, and since then, the text has undergone a great many changes and 
additions. I’m offering it here with the most significant additions.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1022>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>22. Family Homestead 
Declaration</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Declaration of My Family Homestead</p><p>(Draft)</p><p>I, a citizen of the Russian Federation, have 
familiarized myself with the philosophy of a way of life that has been set forth in fictional form in the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” book series. The idea of creating a 
family homestead has inspired me to take action.</p><p>I have acquired a plot of land in a deserted spot out in the country, one hectare in size, with the goal of establishing a 
more perfected dwelling land for my family and my descendants, and in memory of our ancestors.</p><p>I gave the given spot the name “Family Homestead.” On the land I acquired I have 
laid out a garden, dug a pond where fish will breed, and established several families of bees. I cultivate berries and vegetables.</p><p>I plan to fertilize the land using solely 
natural and native means of fertilization.</p><p>I believe that it will be a positive development if a large number of families who have the skills and desire to work the land, and 
who establish their daily lives on family homesteads located around large and small cities, are able to provide urban populations with a large quantity of ecologically pure 
vegetable produce and improve ecological conditions in the provinces.</p><p>I consider it unacceptable that tens of millions of hectares of land in our country are not cultivated 
and are overgrown with tall weeds, at the same time as we purchase 60% of our food products from foreign countries, and that in addition, these products are also often of low 
quality and are harmful to humans, especially children.</p><p>I believe that this situation not only threatens the safety of food in our country, but also destroys the populaces 
living within its territories.</p><p>I believe that under such conditions, it’s counterproductive to accuse the government or anyone else of having made this or that mistake. Our 
entire society has made mistakes, and not only our country’s society. As a result, the societies of many countries stand on the brink of social disruptions. In the current 
situation, it’s essential for each person to think about what concrete steps he personally can take in the very near future to bring about positive changes.</p><p>The example of 
countries that have placed their bets on farm economy shows the ineffectiveness and even destructive nature of this choice. Farmers who focus on earning a profit from growing 
agricultural products enter into a competitive battle with each other. In order to prevail, they must use pesticides and herbicides and raise harmful genetically modified 
crops, and by doing this, they endanger the lives of people of entire states.</p><p>On the family homestead, a family lives and grows produce to meet its own needs and the needs of 
its relatives who live in the cities. Thus, a family living on a family homestead has a fundamentally different relationship with the land. The surplus produce from the 
homesteads will differ from all other produce that appears on the shelves of city stores in its beneficial nature.</p><p>The intensifying worldwide economic crisis creates the 
threat of social disorder in many countries. If we’re to come out of this crisis, we must have a fundamentally new philosophy of a family way of life, one that people will 
understand. And such a philosophy has been set forth in the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” book series. I have accepted its fundamental concepts and they have inspired me to take 
the actions laid out above.</p><p>More than a hundred families – families in which children are being born and raised in a more perfected ecological setting – have each acquired one 
hectare of land and are already building their own family homesteads alongside my own family homestead. Practice has shown that they’re doing so not because of some infusion 
of capital, but because of this philosophy.</p><p>I’m aware that thanks to this philosophy, tens of thousands of families in various regions of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are 
already building their family homesteads. Millions of families are planning to do so as soon as a more favorable legislative basis for this is established. Many families are 
planning to become small business owners and produce agricultural products.</p><p>I fully support efforts by the Government and President of the Russian Federation to create 
favorable conditions for building small houses outside the cities, and to also make lands designated for agricultural use available for the construction of small houses, and 
to allocate each family a plot of land. I believe that each plot should be not less than one hectare in size, since on a smaller plot it’s impossible to establish a 
comparably perfected and self-sustaining ecosystem and small-scale agriculture.</p><p>If families are not allocated a large enough plot of land, the settlements around the cities 
will turn into consumers instead of producers, which will only exacerbate the food, ecological and social situation in the country. I consider it essential for us to urgently 
ask the Government and President of the Russian Federation to speed up their work in this direction and adopt the necessary law regarding family homesteads.</p><p>I appeal to the 
President and Congress of the United States of America, to the UN, and to the heads of all states who have a vested interest in the flowering of the peoples living in them, 
and recommend that they examine and embrace the idea that creating family homesteads is the most effective plan for enabling countries to come out of the global economic 
crisis, avert the approaching ecological catastrophe, and avoid a food crisis.</p><p>A significant portion of the peoples of Russia see the “Family Homestead” plan as a national 
idea. May it become an international national idea – and may our countries compete with each other to make the beautiful future a reality.</p><p>If the governments of various 
countries sincerely understand this idea, publicize it and support it, then the depression that is advancing on us can be stopped. An inspired, constructive international 
process will begin.</p><p>The actions of thousands of Russian families have already proven the positive influence of the “Family Homestead” plan. More than fifteen hundred Russian 
families, who have already begun building their own family homesteads have signed declarations like this one. We continue to collect signatures.</p><p>I wish all like-minded people 
success and inspiration as they creatively build a beautiful environment where their families can live – in various countries, and in the world as a whole!</p><p>Signature of the 
founder(s) of the family homestead</p><p>With the passage of time, this document, which has already taken on a life of its own, began to give rise in me to an ever-growing feeling 
of significance. I was getting the feeling that it’s not a passport, a diploma or any awards that constitute a person’s most important documents, but precisely this kind of 
declaration. Returning in my mind to this document again and again, I kept trying to understand why I was having these feelings. The text and language might vary, but they 
aren’t what’s most important here. What’s important is the essence.</p><p>I read the declaration to Anastasia, told her about my feelings, and asked:</p><p>“What do you think Anastasia, 
why do these feelings arise, and not only in me? I’ve spoken with many people, and they also experience the feeling that the declaration is very significant, but no one can 
explain why that happens. Why is it?”</p><p>“You see, Vladimir, the feeling that this document is significant immediately arose in me, also. But like you and these others, what 
about it makes me feel that way – I am unable to explain that immediately. Perhaps we need to ponder it a bit together?”</p><p>“Perhaps, but I’ve already pondered it a great deal. 
The feeling that it’s significant remains, but I still haven’t understood why that is.”</p><p>Suddenly Anastasia drew herself up somehow and began to shine. She began speaking, 
pronouncing each syllable distinctly, just the way she always did when she was trying to emphasize something significant:</p><p>“Vladimir, I think I am beginning to understand where 
its great significance lies. Look! When the Creator was creating the earthly world, before the great Creation, He first gave voice to his intention. He imparted it to all the 
entities of the Universe, and when they asked, ‘What is it you so fervently desire?’ he replied, ‘Co-creation and joy for all who behold it.’”</p><p>“But can it really be so 
important to impart your intentions to everyone?”</p><p>“Of course. It is very important. For, imparting it to all means, above all, imparting it to yourself, as well. It means 
comprehending what is taking place, and believing in yourself.</p><p>“Besides, having declared your intentions in words, you are already materializing them. By imparting them to 
all, you call upon them to join you in co-creation.”</p><p>“Why do I need to call upon everybody? I mean, somebody might laugh at me, or oppose me, or be indifferent.”</p><p>“Derision, 
opposition and indifference will be participants in the co-creation from the other side. They are needed to fill out this creation, within which you will bring everything 
into balance.”</p><p>“I’m feeling an excitement inside, Anastasia. Where’s that coming from?”</p><p>“Vladimir, I, too, feel excited. This document has appeared as a herald of a new era on 
Earth. The aspirations of the people who stand behind it are holding within them a great realization. For thousands of years people lived without determining their own lives. 
What were they striving for, and why? What should the new generations carry forth? Should they bear in mind where those paths went wrong? Which paths? Amidst the bustle of 
life, women gave birth children, but they offered no goals in life to those they bore. Their children knew not, what they were to carry forward. And they would die, the 
earthly civilizations, having lived out their empty lives. Only pottery shards remained of them, and arrowheads. The children would heed others’ opinions of their parents.</p><p>“And what your grandfather wanted of life, Vladimir – he did not impart this to your father and mother in words. Nor did they impart that to you in words. You are their 
continuation. Tell me, what kind of continuation did they want in life?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I can only imagine.”</p><p>“You can imagine whatever you might like. But you know for sure 
that they did not impart it, their life’s aspiration.”</p><p>“Of course they didn’t. Nor do all the other people I know.”</p><p>“For the first time in perhaps billions of year, as if 
awakening at dawn, a man has said, ‘I have an aspiration. I will begin my creation, and my generations will live in a promised land around them16. And they will perfect the 
promised land around them. Of course, they will be more perfected than I. But I will begin it all! And a little part of me will live on in my descendants.’</p><p>“You can cite many 
examples of how that which we do not impart in words dies along with the physical body.</p><p>“A man was thinking about how he might improve for his descendants the land where he 
lived, and he planted a cedar tree on his plot. Before long, the man died. Twenty-nine years passed, and the tree grew into a beautiful, spreading cedar, fifteen meters tall. 
Within but a year it would have borne marvelous, healing fruit, but people – the children of the man who had planted it – cut it down. They thought, why do we need this tree 
here? It casts a shadow over part of our plot, and its shade is keeping the tomatoes and cucumbers from growing in their beds. And they cut down the spreading cedar, and they 
cut it down precisely because the man had not given voice to his intentions.</p><p>“Genghis Khan conquered nearly half the world and brought Russia, India, China and Palestine 
together beneath his rule, so that there would be no war. He built roads, lowered taxes, and honored the traditions and cultures of various peoples, but he himself lived not 
in the palaces he had seized, but in a yurt. He sought to bring wise men from all over the world to him. Together with these wise men, he talked about how they could go about 
making people happy, and how to help everyone come to know eternity and immortality of peoples. Of all conquerors of the Earth, his empire endured the longest. He knew 
something. He attained and displayed it, but the empire collapsed all the same. And Genghis Khan has come down to us through the ages as just a conqueror. Who from among 
those alive today is able to say what his true intentions were? He didn’t give voice to them.”</p><p>“Well, perhaps they were just destroyed or are preserved in scrolls somewhere 
now.”</p><p>“Intentions should be preserved not only in scrolls, but in the hearts of the people. Genghis Khan wasn’t able to give voice to them so that they would be passed from 
generation to generation through the ages.”</p><p>“Those are striking examples. It’s amazing – why, for millions of years didn’t people attach any particular importance to the need 
to give voice to their lives? Now I’m thinking the same thing, that this document presages a new era. Tell me, Anastasia, how will you give voice to your aspirations – both 
before people and yourself?”</p><p>“Why, all of my aspirations are already laid out in your books, Vladimir. If I were to add anything else specific, I’d say, ‘I will gather 
together the best sounds from the whole Universe and will embed them into combinations of letters and into musical notes.’ I will ask today’s poets, you, Vladimir, and the 
bards to give voice to them. A great many people will sense them with their souls. Let people express them in a language they understand, let them model the dawn of the earth 
and its beautiful flowering. And when the melodies of man’s worthy land embrace the entire Earth, then I, amongst our kind neighbors, will help our grandchildren create their 
homesteads, and all the while, I will not forget my own family space.</p><p>“But what should I say to myself, and how should I voice my own declaration before people?”</p><p>“Each person 
needs to consider that on his own.”</p><p>“Yes. Of course. Each person on his own. Even this draft I already have resonates with me. I’ll think on my own about what I can add to it 
to make it my own.</p><p>“I’ll ask all the readers to consider it, too.</p><p>“This document is essential. It’s an important missive from the founders of a family homestead to the future 
generations of their family line. It’s a directive that comes from the people and goes to those at all levels of power, a communication with them. It will be a good thing if 
each family keeps a beautifully designed document like this, like a kind of relic, alongside the family book17 of the family homestead’s founders or those who intend to found 
one.</p><p>“A person will read it with awe and gratitude in his family homestead’s beautiful garden even a hundred years later, and he’ll read it and recall the founder. And another 
person, a hundred years later, a person who has lost his way in life’s whirlwind will suddenly come across it as he’s looking through his parents’ old things and will read 
about their unfulfilled intentions. And the person will have a burning desire to make them a reality.</p><p>“And I think it would also be useful to send this kind of document to 
each member of local governments personally, and to the UN.</p><p>“Similarly, I consider it essential to establish a yearly scientific and practical conference called ‘Family 
Homesteads of the Future.’ under the auspices of the UN.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1023>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>23. My Lonely Little Hectare </h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ 
</br></div> </p><p>Anastasia has one trait that is, in my opinion, a bit aggravating. She possesses a colossal volume 
of information and is happy to answer many questions, but there are some she categorically refuses to answer. Sometimes this categorical nature of hers annoys me, and 
sometimes it simply enrages me. But even when she sees my annoyance and rage, she nonetheless maintains her position.</p><p>For example, she categorically refuses to make a sample 
layout for a family homestead and its landscaping. “If I were to do that, I’d be meddling in your creation, Vladimir, putting the brakes on your thought’s motion. I would be 
the one birthing the design, not you. It would be as if it were not your own child,” she says, and then she brings in various other arguments, as well.</p><p>But a serious and 
insoluble situation had come up for me that was precisely concerned with establishing a homestead. I spent a long time thinking about how to convince Anastasia to either help 
me or to say that the problem was insoluble so that I wouldn’t spend my time and have nothing to show for it.</p><p>I made another attempt to win Anastasia over and convince her to 
sacrifice her principles. I picked a suitable time – it was a sunny day and the taiga was fragrant. Anastasia was sitting beneath a cedar tree, weaving her golden hair into a 
braid. I was walking back and forth near her, mentally selecting some weighty arguments. She was the first to speak. Smiling, she asked affectionately:</p><p>“Have some complicated 
thoughts gotten you all stirred up, Vladimir? You’re right here beside me, yet at the same time, in your thoughts, you’re far from these parts.”</p><p>I took a seat next to 
Anastasia and began to speak, trying to be as convincing as possible.</p><p>“You see, Anastasia, a certain situation has come up, and I can’t possible deal with it without your 
help.”</p><p>“What situation, Vladimir?”</p><p>“Seven years ago, not far from the city of Vladimir, when I was having a look at the surrounding countryside, I drove onto a field in my jeep 
and got stuck. The vehicle was stuck up to its underside and the only way to pull it out was to use a tractor. While I was waiting for the tractor driver, I looked around at 
the abandoned field, overgrown with tall weeds. It was a rather pretty spot there. The field was surrounded by a mixed forest, and a stream flowed in front of the forest, and 
not far off, you could glimpse a big lake. And I thought, it would be a good thing if a settlement of family homesteads were to spring up here. People would build pretty 
homes, dig flower beds, put in gardens and build some normal roads.</p><p>“And I could hardly believe it – that’s exactly what happened: a year later, on that very spot. People – 
readers of the ‘Ringing Cedars of Russia’ book series – began acquiring land so they could build family homesteads. The organizers suggested I take a hectare, too, and – I 
don’t even why, myself – I agreed. Maybe right then I felt like supporting them. But I hardly did anything at all with my hectare, and sometimes I’d totally forget about it. 
I only called twice and asked people to sow some mustard on the land, to improve the soil. The lands there are not very fertile – there’s layer of fertile soil about fifteen 
to twenty centimeters thick, and below that there’s about thirty centimeters of sand, and below that, nothing but clay.</p><p>“I totally forgot about my hectare. I have an apartment 
and a country house not far from town. You know of it, Anastasia. And I have a place to live in Siberia, too.</p><p>“But then, five years later, I happened to come to the spot where 
my jeep had gotten stuck. Even as I was driving up, I was astounded by what I saw. Can you imagine, Anastasia? Miracles do happen! Along both sides of the big lake, in the 
spot where there used to be a deserted space, there were homes. All different kinds. Big ones, solid ones and totally tiny ones. Driveways paved with gravel led from the main 
road to the homes. People had divided up the abandoned fields surrounding the lake into plots and were building up their family homesteads.</p><p>“I recalled how I’d dreamed there, 
by my stuck jeep, about family homesteads on just one field. But here, I could hardly believe it – people were settling all the fields surrounding the lake. A little island 
of the new and happy Russia was being born on this deserted space, overgrown with tall weeds.”</p><p>“That means your dream was powerful, Vladimir, and correct. They embraced it. 
And now you’ve seen the way it’s materializing, developing.”</p><p>“I should have been more careful what I wished for, five years ago, by my jeep. If I’d known how everything would 
turn out, then I’d have nipped that dream in the bud. I failed to take one thing into account, Anastasia.</p><p>“Now I’ll tell you everything in order. And this is where I 
desperately need your help.”</p><p>“Go on, then, Vladimir, and tell me everything in order.”</p><p>“Five years later, I was riding along a gravel road in that very same jeep with one of 
the local settlers. One spot caught my eye, and I stopped the jeep by a hectare that was overgrown with tall weeks. To the left of it, on another hectare, was a construction 
trailer, and next to it – a beautiful home with a roof had been put up. It didn’t have any glass in the windows as of yet, but from all appearances you could see that people 
were making their family homestead livable. And to the right of the abandoned hectare was a beautiful, wooden home, too, as well as farmyard structures, and a bathhouse, and 
they’d dug a pond. It was as if this home on the right took great pride in its flower beds and, of course, in the people that had made it beautiful. And then I said to my 
travelling companion, ‘I get the impression that these hectares of land have their own fates, and that their fates are ties with the people’s.’</p><p>“‘I think so, too,’ my 
travelling companion replied. ‘Probably, each person has his own hectare of land somewhere on Earth, but he doesn’t know anything about it, or has forgotten about it.’</p><p>“I went 
on talking. ‘When huge fields are abandoned, individual hectares don’t feel so insulted, because they’re all in the same situation, like homeless children. But this is a 
different case. It’s insulting. The hectares to the right and the left are being set up, but this one, between the two of them, looks like an abandoned child.’</p><p>“My companion 
said nothing and even looked down somehow, as if he felt awkward, both for the hectare overgrown with tall weeds, and for the person who’d abandoned it.</p><p>“And I asked, ‘Whose 
hectare is this?’ ‘It’s yours, Vladimir Nikolaevich,’ my travelling companion replied, without raising his eyes.</p><p>“‘Mine?...’</p><p>“‘Yes. Well, we all got together and made a 
driveway onto it. We laid a pipe in the ditch and covered it over with stone. We put in posts to mark the driveway, and we planted little fir trees on both sides. But nothing 
more – each person looks after his own land.’</p><p>“I got out of the car. On my hectare, which is almost an exact square, a hundred meters by a hundred, and which abuts the forest, 
only tall weeds were growing. It didn’t just seem abandoned and lonely, like a homeless child. No, it was far worse off than a homeless child. Even a homeless child can go 
off somewhere, find himself some friends among his peers and somehow get himself set up. My hectare couldn’t do that.</p><p>“I set off along the perimeter of the plot and suddenly 
saw two beautiful little flowers amongst the tall weeds. It was autumn. September. But they were blooming. You couldn’t see them from the road because the weeds were taller. 
‘Wow,’ I thought, ‘My hectare is striving to be beautiful, too. Who knows how the flower seeds got here, but my hectare grew them and is reaching out to me through these 
little flowers, the way a child reaches out with his arms, and it’s asking me to do something.’</p><p>“And some irresistible desire arose in me, the desire to set up this plot of 
land, no matter what, so that it would be no worse than other people’s plots, and maybe even better. I don’t know why that kind of desire arose. I wasn’t thinking of this 
plot of land as a family homestead for my family. I just wanted to make everything on it right and beautiful. And I didn’t just want to – suddenly some irresistible idea 
arose to make it the best of all of them. Maybe later on it will draw my granddaughters to it. When it becomes the best in the world.</p><p>“I’ve returned to my hectare many times 
in my mind. I’ve sketched out the layout of various outbuildings on paper and made a list of the plants that should grow on it. I had to finish my work on the book and take 
care of a great number of other day-to-day affairs, but this hectare continually stirred up my thoughts in a pleasant way and even led my thoughts away from unpleasant 
problems. It’s amazing, but it’s actually thanks to it that I’ve been able to overcome a whole series of day-to-day difficulties and psychological problems. You know, there 
really is something mysterious in man’s bond with the land. Some living link stands behind this bond. And the desire to make my land beautiful and well-tended has grown 
stronger and stronger.”</p><p>“A good desire has arisen within you, Vladimir, even passionate, I’m sensing. It will also be of help to you.”</p><p>“‘It’ who?”</p><p>“Your hectare. You yourself 
say that it stirs up your thoughts and leads them away from unpleasant problems.”</p><p>“There are very big challenges connected to that hectare, Anastasia. It’s kind of like a 
child with a congenital physical defect.”</p><p>“What kind of defect?”</p><p>“Nothing will grow on those lands except weeds. Vegetables won’t grow. And the people in those parts don’t have 
normal gardens. There’s a village nearby, it’s two hundred years old, but the village residents don’t have normal gardens, either. Those lands there have a very thin fertile 
layer, and then right below it, nothing but clay. In the spring the water sits on the surface for a long time, and in the summer, too, if you get a rainy summer. Most plants’ 
roots can’t penetrate the clay. If you were to dig a deep hole in the clay, fill it with fertile earth brought in from somewhere, even then the tree might die. Water will 
collect in the clay pit in the rainy season, the clay will retain it, and the roots will rot.”</p><p>“Vladimir, I do not think that the situation is so very hopeless as you’ve 
painted it. Tell me, how do the people feel about what is happening? Maybe they’re disheartened?”</p><p>“No, they’re not disheartened. The majority of them, they sense that this is 
their family land, for centuries to come. Some of them, even their parents come to visit, live there for a bit and then ask to be buried not in a cemetery, but on the family 
homestead. Everything’s fine, but the fact that the land can’t bear fruit in a normal way is very upsetting to me. I even regretted having dreamt of a settlement springing up 
on this spot. Now it’s like I feel guilty.”</p><p>“What steps will you take now, Vladimir, in regard to your own hectare?”</p><p>“I don’t intend to abandon it. I think there must be some 
way out.”</p><p>“I also think so. You must search for it and find it.”</p><p>“I’ve searched for it, but I haven’t found it. So, I’m asking you to please help.”</p><p>“What task are you posing, 
Vladimir? Lay it out, in detail.”</p><p>I was overjoyed that Anastasia had asked about the specifics of the task, and I decided to formulate it in the most complicated way possible. 
Otherwise, I thought, it wouldn’t be interesting for her. I began to explain:</p><p>“Anastasia, I’m asking you, I ask from the bottom of my heart, please arrange it so that apple 
trees and plum and pear trees, and cherries and sour cherries can grow on my hectare, and on other people’s, too. So grapes can ripen! And good flowers and various shrubs. 
And also arrange it so that all of this can be done at minimal expense. Something an average person can afford, not an oligarch who can put in millions of dollars.”</p><p>“Is that 
all, Vladimir?”</p><p>“No, Anastasia, that’s not all. I ask you, please. I ask you from the bottom of my heart. Arrange it so that all of this comes to pass in no longer than three 
years.”</p><p>“Four or five years would be better.”</p><p>“No, in three.”</p><p>“You’ve set a fine task for yourself, Vladimir. I will genuinely rejoice when you solve it.”</p><p>I actually got worked 
up to a fever pitch by that answer. I jumped to my feet, but restrained myself and didn’t say anything rude. I tried to calm down – as much as that was possible – and 
explain:</p><p>“Anastasia, after all, I’m not just asking on my own behalf. Please understand. There are three hundred families there on that spot. Three hundred. They’re building 
family homesteads. They’ve understood what you’ve said, they’ve felt it deeply. It’s become their dream! But they’re setting up their homesteads on land that is totally, 
totally low in productivity. It’s even listed that way in the books. These people wouldn’t be able to get any other kind of land. Before, back before Perestroika, these lands 
belonged to a State farm. At that time, the State worked to improve those lands – with a drainage system, by sinking pipes into the ground to drain off the water, but even 
so, aside from grain, nothing would grow on them.</p><p>“And now all those improvements are no longer in existence, the equipment has all been stolen, and there’s practically 
nothing that can be done. And would it even be worth doing, since it didn’t help? How can we improve the productivity of the soil on my hectare now?</p><p>“And besides that, I can’t 
fully imagine the layout of my entire plot. I really want to make everything beautifully and quickly. I need to catch up to the people who are five years ahead of me. And so 
here I’m asking you to help, to do this layout for me and choose the plantings.”</p><p>“Yes, certainly, Vladimir, the layout is very important. The layout – it is creation done with 
the help of the thought of the future, and then the materialization takes place. But if you farm out the layout to me, then what of yours will be materialized on that plot of 
land?”</p><p>“I’m telling you – I’m also planning it myself, but I’m afraid of making a mistake. So, in practice I came up against something that would seem to be such a simple 
matter, like a living fence, and it turns out that it’s not a simple matter at all. You can work on improving it forever, but you need just as much knowledge as a space ship 
designer. You have to know what plant blooms at what time, what kind of soil it needs, how tall it will get over the summer, what kind of flowers it has and how they’ll go 
with the other plants’ flowers, and a whole lot more. I made a plan to build something out of cob, but the experts say it the rain will wash it away. Can you imagine – I’ll 
be building something and will hire workers, and then I’ll be a laughing stock.”</p><p>“Even if you do make a mistake, Vladimir, then it will be your mistake, and it will 
materialize. For this reason, you need to do the layout yourself. Certainly, you can consult with someone, but in this case, the final decision must always rest with you. In 
the spring, Vladimir, it is all right for you to plant only annuals, and when they grow up, mow them down and enrich the soil. And do the very same the following year.”</p><p>“I 
can’t wait. I want to do things fast. Otherwise I’ll lose more than a whole ‘nother year.”</p><p>“Perhaps you shouldn’t rush? It’s better to do everything on a sound footing. What’s 
more, if you set yourself the condition of creating everything anew all in one year, then you will be extremely limited in your choice of plantings, and in the autumn, when 
all the annuals dry up and your living fence is left without any plantings, it might disenchant you. Now, if you do everything properly, then you will receive more positive 
emotions. Although certainly, it is also possible to do everything using a fast track approach.”</p><p>Anastasia grew thoughtful for a moment, and it seemed to me that she was 
considering the fast track approach, but here is what we ended up with.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1024>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>24. The Obstacle of Lack of 
Faith</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“What you are asking for, Vladimir, can be done. I sense that it can be done, but you do not 
want to seek the solution yourself. Rather than spending your energy on the search, you are expending it on convincing me to find a solution.</p><p>“You have placed an obstacle 
before you, consisting of lack of faith in your own powers, and, as you try to convince me, you are fortifying this obstacle more and more. Beyond it, Vladimir, beyond your 
obstacle of lack of faith in your own powers, there are beautiful gardens blooming and glorious flowers growing, and amongst them are living happy people. Yet you cannot see 
all of this. The obstacle you have constructed keeps you from doing so.</p><p>“If I find the solution, then it will grow more fortified still. What’s more, the solution might turn 
out to be very, very simple, and that would be an affront to you. You will think, why ever couldn’t I guess that myself? You will decide it is clear that you are not 
competent.</p><p>“You have turned to me, perhaps thinking me a sorceress who is capable of bringing to bear powers unknown to man to solve your problem, but I am no sorceress at 
all. Through my feelings, I am able to take in from the Universe information about everything that has been, about everything that the Universe knows, but every person is 
also capable of taking in the very same information, if he does not erect the obstacle of lack of faith in his own powers. If he is physically healthy and if he thinks in an 
undistorted way.</p><p>“The information of the Universe resembles that which a supercomputer can contain within it. A person who possesses a computer taps several keys and receives 
the information he needs. Now imagine, Vladimir, that instead of tapping several keys, you ask me to do that. A person is in continual need of information, and if he does not 
himself know how to tap these keys himself, then he will always need to have alongside him someone who does know how.”</p><p>“Well, I know how to get information using a computer. I 
don’t know how to get it from the Universe.”</p><p>“It’s simple, very simple: seek the solution of your problem yourself. Believe that you, precisely you, will find the correct 
solution. The most correct one.”</p><p>“Well, I’ve been thinking bout this, thinking about it for a whole year, and there’s no answer.”</p><p>“And I am telling you: the answer cannot make 
its way through the obstacle you have constructed, and your fervent appeal to me only confirms this. I will not solve your problem for you.”</p><p>Anastasia’s decisive refusal to 
help me outraged me.</p><p>“Well, of course, you won’t. You’re firm in your convictions. No arguments can make you act otherwise,” I said, with bitter irony. “I repeat, again: there 
are three hundred families there, and God forbid the same situation arises for people building family homesteads in other places that has arisen here, but there are three 
hundred…”</p><p>“Vladimir, perhaps God actually gave rise to this situation. Imagine: if there had been fertile soil there right from the start, then these people would not have 
received these spots. Perhaps God himself arranged everything this way, and those in power deemed these lands unsuitable for growing gardens. This situation made it possible 
for three hundred families to acquire this land and begin building family homesteads. Perhaps someone is even having at laugh at their expense and figuring that their 
heavenly oases won’t succeed, but the information will push its way through to one of them in the form of a tiny spark, and these spots will be lit up by billions of flowers 
on fruit trees and in the grasses.”</p><p>“Maybe it will push its way through, that tiny spark, but look, we want to live today, now, and with a beautiful vision of the future, not 
with hopelessness.”</p><p>All of a sudden I sensed a pleasant warmth behind my back and turned around. My son Volodya18 was standing next to me. Our eyes met, and the unusual warmth 
grew stronger.</p><p>My son’s face looked like Anastasia’s and maybe a little bit like mine when I was young. His height was nearly equal to mine. His still youthful build was 
distinguished by its good proportions and unusual athleticism – one expressed through ideal balance, rather than artificially pumped up muscles.</p><p>My son’s gaze… it resembled 
Anastasia’s affectionate gaze, and in this gaze there was also… You see, in his gaze you could detect an inexplicable confidence. An inexplicable and somehow calm confidence. 
It’s as if he has no idea that any difficulties even exist in life, or as if he can’t imagine any situations that man can’t overcome.</p><p>Volodya bowed to me and then began 
speaking, addressing Anastasia:</p><p>“Mama, I heard what you were speaking of here. Mama, please allow me to address you and express my opinion.” He bowed deferentially to 
Anastasia and silently awaited her reply.</p><p>This was the first time I had seen or felt the kind of deference and love he had for Anastasia. He probably couldn’t begin a 
conversation without her permission.</p><p>Anastasia looked at our son attentively, in no hurry to answer. There was no severity in her gaze, but rather tenderness and respect.</p><p>“Strange,” I thought. “Why is she taking so long to answer this simplest request of his? The speed of her thought is great – in the space of such a long pause she would be 
able to calculate a multitude of variations of the way events could play out. But here, there’s nothing to calculate.”</p><p>Anastasia finally replied:</p><p>“Do speak, my dear son. Papa 
and I will listen to you attentively.”</p><p>“Mama, I feel it would be good and correct for you to help Papa. I feel it’s important for him to solve this problem. And if you help 
him, the obstacle of lack of faith in his own powers and his own intelligence will not grow more fortified, but rather, smaller. It will even crumble – partially, perhaps, 
but it will still crumble.” And Volodya fell silent.</p><p>Once again, Anastasia did not answer right away. For some time she looked at our son affectionately, smiling, and then she 
said:</p><p>“Well, of course you are right, my dear son – in the given situation, it really is necessary to help Papa. Volodya, you go ahead. Please help Papa. The two of you will 
find a solution, along with other people. It will be best if you begin searching for it right away, right here, and I will not hinder you.”</p><p>Anastasia turned and began slowly 
moving away from us. After taking a few steps, she turned around and added:</p><p>“You are faced with co-creating a very interesting and useful deed – demonstrably and significantly 
perfecting the dwelling land.”</p><p>My son and I stood before each other. I asked him:</p><p>“Tell me, Volodya, can you use all the information there is in the Universe, the way Mama can? 
Many thinkers speak of it. Stanislav Lem, a very famous writer, he said the Universe is like a supercomputer. We can’t get along without it. Do you have any success in 
utilizing it?”</p><p>“Not in utilizing it as fast as Mama does.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because Mama is a purebred.”</p><p>“What does that mean, ‘a purebred’?” I asked in surprise.</p><p>“That means the 
wellspring peoples’ breed has been preserved in her.”</p><p>“And why hasn’t it been preserved in you? Oh, I get it…” And I thought to myself, “It’s because I’m not a purebred. 
That’s probably the way Anastasia explained it to him. But then why the heck did she agree to have a child with a non-purebred? She couldn’t find anyone else? Is that what it 
means?”</p><p>My son looked at me attentively. It’s possible he understood what I was thinking about, and he said:</p><p>“Mama loves you very much, Papa. Come along with me. I’ll show you 
two things.”</p><p>“Let’s go,” I said, agreeing, and set off following my son.</p><p>When we got to the entrance to the dug-out where I’d spent the night with Anastasia when we first met, 
Volodya moved aside a stone, thereby opening up a way into a longish little cave, or den. He stuck his hand inside and, as if taking something out of a safe, pulled out an 
empty cognac bottle and a stick.</p><p>I recognized it: this was the bottle from which I’d drunk the cognac when we first met, when we stopped for a rest. “Wow,” I thought. “She 
kept the bottle.”</p><p>“But what’s that stick?” I asked Volodya.</p><p>“This is the stick you wanted to hit Mama with, when, before I was born, she wouldn’t agree to give me to you to 
raise.”</p><p>“She could have not saved the stick,” I said sheepishly.</p><p>“Mama says that when you were holding this stick, a great deal of energy was surging through you, and now it’s 
very dear to her.”</p><p>“But what does she do with them, with these things? At the very least, she might collect water in the bottle.”</p><p>“Mama doesn’t collect water in it. She often 
comes to this spot, moves aside the stone, takes the bottle and the stick in her hand, looks at them, smiling, and says some words. She’s made it so that you’ll live forever, 
Papa. From time to time you’ll go to sleep for a moment and awaken in a new body.”</p><p>I was stunned. “But how can you create such a thing with words?”</p><p>“You can create a great deal 
with words, Papa, and especially when these words are uttered by Mama. Oh, and when she repeats them so often, besides.”</p><p>“What words are these, Volodya?” I asked my son 
softly.</p><p>And my son began, as if reciting poetry, to recite the words Anastasia would often utter at this spot:</p><p>“My love, you and I have before us all eternity. Life always 
comes into its own. A little ray of sun will shine in the springtime, the Soul will don a new body, but the mortal body, too, has reason to meekly embrace the earth – fresh 
flowers and grass will rise in the springtime from our bodies. And should you, retaining your lack of faith, scatter to the winds as specks of dust in the vast Universe, then 
I, my love, will put you back together again from the specks of dust wandering adrift for eons on end.”</p><p>“Volodya, I also heard Anastasia say these words one day. I thought it 
was just some pretty phrase she was uttering. I had no idea they had a literal meaning.”</p><p>“Yes, Papa, they have a literal meaning.”</p><p>“Well, how do you like that,” I said, drawing 
out the words. “Many thanks to Anastasia for eternity.”</p><p>“Papa, say thank you to Mama when you see her. Say it to her with belief in her words, and she will be very happy.”</p><p>“I’ll tell her.”</p><p>“We need to solve your problem, Papa, the problem that’s now our shared problem. Let’s go to the lake. We’ll sketch out a layout of the hectare you’re talking 
about in the sand, and we’ll think about how to set it up. We’ll think very powerfully and we’ll think until the correct solution comes to us.”</p><p>I walked behind my son and 
thought, “Well, but how? How can it come to us, this solution? There’s no answer to be found, not in the literature and not on the Internet. I’d searched for it everywhere, 
but hadn’t found it. I’d consulted with experts on agricultural methods, and they hadn’t given me any valuable advice. But he, Volodya, had clearly not read anything on this 
question. He didn’t have Anastasia’s capabilities. He didn’t know how to utilize information from the entire Universe. Then what could he use to help him find something 
there? But there he was, walking along, as if he was capable of solving the problem. We need to do something that will be more effective than meaningless expectations or 
searching.” And I decided I’d talk with my son.</p><p>“Stop, Volodya. Let’s have a seat on that tree there. I need to have a serious chat with you.”</p><p>“All right, Papa, let’s have a 
seat. I’ll listen to you attentively.”</p><p>We sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree. My son laid his hands on his knees and looked at me attentively with Anastasia’s gaze, but I 
didn’t know how to start off this not very pleasant conversation with him. Not very pleasant, but necessary.</p><p>“Now I’m going to say some things that may be not very pleasant 
for you, Volodya, but I need to say them.”</p><p>“Go ahead and say them, Papa. I can endure unpleasant things. I won’t be offended.”</p><p>“Volodya, you need to understand that Anastasia 
directed you to help me so that I’d stop pestering her with my questions. You won’t be able to offer any help whatsoever, not to me, and not to those people who are setting 
up their homesteads. You don’t have Mama’s capabilities, you don’t know your way around agricultural methods, and clearly, you don’t know what ‘landscape design’ is. Am I 
right?”</p><p>“Papa, I think that landscape design is when a person is planning to create a space that’s beautiful.”</p><p>“That’s more or less it, but in order to make it beautiful, 
people who have a knack for this also spend five years or more studying, sharing information and looking at various illustrations. But have you seen even one well-designed 
homestead?”</p><p>“When Mama and I went to the village, I saw the way, on the land around their houses, people…”</p><p>“All you’ve seen is village gardens that have no design at all.”</p><p>“Yes, 
Papa, gardens. But I’ve imagined how I would make my own homestead. I’ve reflected on that often and imagined it.”</p><p>“Just imaginings alone aren’t enough. You need serious and 
comprehensive knowledge that you don’t have. And so, it follows that you have no basis for thinking. As for me, well, I’ve been thinking for a lot more than a year. And not 
just thinking – I’ve been consulting with experts, too. It’s all no use. And we won’t be able to get this business off the ground now simply with our thinking. But you really 
can help. I’ve hatched a plan. You should help me convince Anastasia to join in with us on solving this problem. If we give it all we’ve got, she’ll give in.”</p><p>“But Papa, Mama 
already made a decision. And her decision is help. I cannot allow myself to try to convince Mama to reverse her decision.”</p><p>“I see! He can’t allow himself!” I cried. “So, when 
Mama tells you to help, you obey her without thinking. But when your father asks, then right away it’s ‘I won’t.’ So that’s how you’re being raised! No respect for your 
elders! For your father!”</p><p>“I have great respect for you, Papa,” Volodya objected calmly. “I will carry out your request and help you.”</p><p>“Now, that’s more like it. Now, let’s 
take a bit of a walk somewhere until evening, then we’ll go to Anastasia as if we’re really upset. She won’t be able to stand it and will start helping us.”</p><p>“Papa, when I said 
I would help, I mean that I’d work with you to solve the problem of how to make the soil more productive, and make a mock-up of the landscaping for the whole homestead.”</p><p>“Ah, 
so that’s how it is! You mean, you’ll help me solve it. Do you even get… Come on, you’ll get it…” And I set off walking toward the shore at a fast clip.</p><p>I used a twig to 
sketch out a plan in the sand of the hectare abutting the forest. Volodya used various grasses and sticks, which he stuck into the sand on one side, to represent the forest 
that abuts the side of the plot opposite the road. I had sketched the layout of the plot just so Volodya could realize in practical terms of how useless his attempts were. 
But then it happened that I myself got caught up in searching for all possible options.</p><p>We spent two days thinking about this problem of how to arrange it so that gardens 
would grow up and various vegetables would mature on not very fertile land. We went over and over it in our minds and discussed a great many options, but we weren’t finding a 
solution to the problem. And we weren’t finding a solution, because one of the conditions was to do everything with minimal resources. If not for that condition, then with 
enough money we could bring in fertile dirt on dump trucks, but we would need a minimum of fifty loads of dirt. Each load costs seventeen thousand rubles. It follows that 
we’d need eight hundred-fifty thousand rubles.</p><p>The majority of the three hundred families couldn’t afford that. What’s more, in the spring, water close to the surface might 
wash out the fertile layer and carry it away as it ran off to the flat lands.</p><p>In order to distract ourselves from what at that point seemed like the hopeless problem of 
improving the soil’s productivity, Volodya and I began designing the landscaping for the area. Or, more precisely, we attempted to arrange various structures so that they’d 
complement each other and the surrounding area.</p><p>I explained to Volodya:</p><p>“First of all we need to build the outhouse and the bath house, then the shed, the home, the garage, the 
root cellar and the greenhouse. We have to arrange all of this somehow so it will be both pretty and convenient.”</p><p>We constructed a mock-up of the home out of sand and placed 
it at the center of the plot. The bath house and outhouse were next to the home, and the shed on the backside of the home. We created the greenhouse out of sand, too. We laid 
a little white stick atop the oblong mound so it would look like glass or plastic sheeting.</p><p>Clearly, this greenhouse wouldn’t fit in anywhere. We built it first to the right 
of the home and then to the left, but even so, it stuck out of the overall grouping like a sore thumb. And really, I didn’t like this so-called grouping itself, and, to all 
appearances, neither did Volodya. Gazing thoughtfully at the rough design, he said:</p><p>“We’ve made some kind of mistake.”</p><p>“And not just one,” I added. “Looks like there’s a lot of 
them.”</p><p>“But even so, I think it’s one. There must be some kind of right approach, some principle, some view, or some other kind of thing that will solve all the problems at 
once.”</p><p>“And what kind of new approach could that possibly be? I’ve laid everything out the way most people in the country do. This layout has been worked out over the 
centuries. It’s all we’ve got. People just can’t have been mistaken for centuries, not knowing some principle that might not even exist at all.”</p><p>“It does exist. I sense that.” 
Volodya was silent for a bit and then added, “Or, perhaps it will exist. We have to think, Papa, and we’ll find it.”</p><p>“And where the heck will we find it, if neither you nor I 
is in contact with this Universal data base?”</p><p>“We’ll look for it within ourselves.”</p><p>“Well, maybe you’ll find it within you, but I’ll be sixty years old soon, and I probably 
won’t have enough time.”</p><p>“We’ll have enough time, Papa. We’ll definitely have enough time. I’ll try very, very hard. I’ll find it. We’ll find it.”</p><p>I had strained my thoughts to 
such a great extent, that even during the night, when I’d fallen asleep on the fragrant grasses in the dug-out, I kept going over and over all possible options in my dreams. 
In my dreams, the fruit trees and flowers grew quickly, right before my very eyes, but then they just as quickly wilted and fell without giving any fruit.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1025>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>25. A Duel of Wizards</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>By 
the middle of the second day, we were considering this option: what if we didn’t drive ourselves crazy worrying about soil productivity and didn’t draw the spring waters off 
the plot, but rather, blocked the streams from draining off and chose plants that love water? This option proved somewhat sparse, and it lacked a good garden. At this point 
Anastasia came up, leading our daughter by the hand.</p><p>Little Nastenka probably figured that Volodya and I were playing some kind of game. She quickly sat down with us and began 
attentively looking over the mock-up. We’d already dug out a pit on it to represent the pond. On the edge there was a mountain of sand that represented the clay, since there 
was a lot of clay in the soil on the plot.</p><p>So as not to sit there like a lump, I began running a stick around the perimeter of the hectare, deepening the boundary line. Then I 
threw away the stick and began simply looking at the sand mock-up.</p><p>On all fours, Nastenka crawled right up to the mock-up, sat down at the edge, thoughtfully rubbed her little 
nose for some reason and suddenly… Her chubby little hand started raking the sand onto the boundary line and forming a little hill. She did this slowly and carefully. When 
she got to the middle of one of the sides of the hectare, Volodya, too, began making an oblong little hill on his side. And without knowing why myself, I also began raking 
the sand up onto the line with both hands.</p><p>What we ended up with was a hectare framed on four sides with an earthen mound. Silently, we looked at what we’d created. Each of 
us, me included, was probably trying to understand what this might mean.</p><p>Anastasia’s voice rang out behind my back. “Ah! I’ve got it! How great! You’ve found a very unusual 
solution! Now, now I will attempt to understand, to guess your intention more precisely. There! I’ve got it! You decided to take the already existing fertile soil on the 
hectare and spread a nearly meter-high mound of fertile soil along the perimeter of the hectare. And to use a portion of the fertile layer as well as sand. Great! You’ve 
increased the thickness of the fertile layer.</p><p>“Around the perimeter of the entire plot, you decided to make two little walls of cob, four meters apart. There will be a lot of 
clay from digging the pond, and you can use it to construct these little walls. In this way, your mound will end up being inside a clay trench. Into this trench you will 
throw branches and rotting foliage from the forest, and then you will even out the earth on top of them. You will have a long, four-hundred-meter compost trench in which the 
elevated earth will be above the regular level of the whole plot. The clay walls will prevent the fertile layer from sliding off when the spring rains fall.</p><p>“The elevated 
earth will warm up more quickly in the spring, and this will enable you to set out many plants two weeks earlier than usual. This means that you have correctly understood, 
that it makes less sense to make compost by digging a hole in earth where water stands on the surface for a long time, since the pit will fill with water, water which, in 
soil with much clay in it, will have nowhere to go, and if you plant fruit trees in it, their roots can rot.</p><p>“On this mound, already the first year, you will be able to plant 
corn and sunflowers, and along the external sides – flowers. By autumn, already in the very first year, the hectare will be framed not simply by a mound, but by a mound on 
which a two-meter high green fence will grow. Closer on to autumn you will cover it over, spread earth over it again, and by the next spring, this mound will grow more 
fertile still. When the earth firms up, you will be able to set out on it fruit trees, vegetables and flowers. Over time, the clay walls might settle, due to moisture, but 
even so, the settled clay will still retain the fertile layer, and the plants’ roots will keep it from sliding off.</p><p>“And those half-meter cob squares you will have built next 
to the pond – what are they for? Oh, don’t tell me! I’ve got it. You will fill them with fertile soil you’ve brought from the forest, and you’ll plant fruit trees in them, 
and around the trees – vegetables and flowers.</p><p>“It’s great, what a simple and original solution you’ve found. You decided to raise the fertile layer in the necessary spots, 
increasing it to half a meter. The roots will be warm and comfortable in a little hill like that. And after that, the trees that grow will themselves do what’s needed. Each 
autumn the trees will cast off their foliage, and it will all rot, increasing the fertile layer.</p><p>“It’s great. It’s as if you pushed a button and turned on a self-nurturing 
biological organism.”</p><p>I understood that Anastasia was laying out the solution she had found, but making it seem as if we had found it and all she was doing was figuring it 
out. This situation did not humiliate me in the least. I was thrilled with the solution she’d found. It was simple and beautiful and wouldn’t require large expenditures.</p><p>But 
Volodya was not at all thrilled. He was staring fixedly at the mock-up of the homestead without lifting his head. My heart even felt like it would break when I understood 
what might be going on in his soul at that moment. He felt awkward before me for having assured me that he could find a solution. And probably before himself as well, for not 
carrying out the task Anastasia had given him.</p><p>My son and I had grown closer over as we’d working on the design together over that day and a half, and I didn’t get offended at 
all any more at his stubbornness. I saw how Volodya was trying, sorting through all possible options for improving the soil’s productivity. And now I felt sorry for him, and 
I even stopped listening to Anastasia. Really, you can’t go and humiliate a child like that! It wasn’t enough that the night before, I’d kept telling him, trying to prove he 
wouldn’t be able to come up with anything – now Anastasia, too, with her ensuing criticism, had totally reduced our efforts to rubble. She shouldn’t act that way. Or… It 
seemed to me that Anastasia was teasing our son on purpose, forcing him to rack his brains and speed up his thought.</p><p>“And so what does this square in the middle of your design 
represent?” Anastasia asked.</p><p>“It’s the home,” I replied. “Volodya and I decided to situate the home right in the middle of the homestead. There are various farmyard structures 
around it. We’ve laid a road from the gates to the home, and flowers will be growing along the edges of the road.”</p><p>I was convinced that Anastasia would begin praising such a 
decision, which is why I said “Volodya and I,” although it had been my idea to situate the home in the middle of the homestead. I wanted to support my son in at least some 
way, but I’d ended up doing the opposite.</p><p>“Now, where is the entrance into your home?” Anastasia asked.</p><p>“On the driveway side, of course. You drive right straight up to the 
entrance, leave your car in the parking area right in front of it and go up to the veranda. There’ll be a table there. We can drink tea with friends and admire the flowers.”</p><p>“As well as the driveway,” Anastasia added, her voice a bit needling.</p><p>“As well as the driveway,” I replied, “if the driveway is done in a pretty stone.”</p><p>“And what is situated 
behind the home?”</p><p>“Behind the home are the pond, the garden, and a vegetable garden of some kind.”</p><p>“That means your garden has ended up in the back yard. You’re drinking tea on 
the veranda with your friends, admiring the flowers, and everything that’s situated in the back yard is deprived of your attention. Vladimir, you know very well that all 
animals and plants need human attention. Without it, they are unable to fully fulfill their life’s purpose.</p><p>“Plants can give a person the energies he needs, assuming they know 
precisely which energies he needs in the first place. But how will they learn about this if you limit your interaction with them? Vladimir, do you know what the purpose is of 
interacting with the plant world?”</p><p>“I do,” I replied, trying to hide my disappointment that – as it turned out – I hadn’t been terribly successful in placing the home. Half 
the hectare, including the garden, really had ended up in the back yard.</p><p>“And something else I don’t understand,” Anastasia continued, “is why you didn’t remove that huge hill 
on the bank of the pond. It weighs down the space.”</p><p>After hearing these words, Volodya couldn’t restrain himself any more. He stood up, bowed slightly to Anastasia as he’d 
done before, and said:</p><p>“Mama, please permit me to clarify this for you.”</p><p>“Please, dear son, clarify it.”</p><p>They were standing opposite each other, son and mother. But for some 
reason, I got the impression that they were two great wizards of the Universe standing opposite each other. Now they were going to enter into a duel. A duel of intelligence 
and man’s capabilities. My God, how beautiful Anastasia was! How enigmatic and extraordinary in her capabilities and thought was this woman who had become the person closest 
to me. One life, and even two, would not suffice for me to reach her level. And our son, whose facial features somewhat resembled Anastasia’s, was also handsome and 
statuesque, but a bit foolhardy or excessively self-confident. Why was he entering into the showdown? And in my presence, to boot. He himself has said that Anastasia’s 
capacities exceed his own. Probably, he’s proud and decisive, but a bit foolhardy. Even so, I was rooting for Volodya with all my heart – I wanted him to emerge victorious in 
this competition, whatever form it might take. And it began.</p><p>“This isn’t just a hill, Mama,” Volodya said.</p><p>“Then what in the world is it?” Anastasia inquired with a smile, her 
voice a bit needling.</p><p>“Well, how should I put it…”</p><p>Slowly, drawing out the words, clearly trying to think up some rational explanation for the hill, Volodya suddenly said:</p><p>“It’s 
the bath house, Mama.”</p><p>I even started, so surprisingly absurd was my son’s announcement, but, without knowing why myself, I affirmed this, with a kind of gravitas:</p><p>“Yes, it’s a 
normal contemporary bath house, a structure you really need on a homestead. If you don’t have a bath house, then where the heck are you going to wash and have a steam bath?” 
I tried to draw out the time every way I could, to give Volodya some way to get himself out of this fix and think of something. He would have been better off saying this 
mountain would be for skiing during the winter. He definitely was foolhardy. “And you can sleep in the bath house, too, before the home is ready,” I went on, continuing my 
line of reasoning. But now I didn’t know what to say next, and I fell silent.</p><p>“Strange. I see no resemblance between the mountain of clay and a bath house, and somehow, I see 
no entrance at all into this bath house,” Anastasia noted.</p><p>Well, that’s it, I figured – my son really put his foot in it with this bath house, and he’s lost. No more battle of 
the wizards. However, Volodya went on:</p><p>“This is just a mock-up, Mama. The hill that represents the clay – we’ve made it out of sand, and the sand slides off, and it’s 
difficult to show the entrance.” Just as before, Volodya spoke slowly, and clearly he was thinking about something very strenuously as he did so. And suddenly it was as if 
his face lit up, and he kept on talking, but precisely and confidently now: “When we do it out of clay, then right here, on the pond side, we’ll form a small entrance into an 
oval chamber with a cupola. The chamber’s diameter will be two or three meters. The height will be two meters and thirty centimeters. The walls of the structure might be as 
thick as a meter. There are ducts in the walls to let out the smoke and hot air, and they all come together in one big duct that you can then close off with a plug.</p><p>“There can 
be stones along the edges inside the oval chamber, and in the middle is where the fire will be lit.</p><p>“The interior walls of the space will heat up. You’ll be able to admire the 
fire from the pond side, and if you don’t want to admire it, you can cover the entrance over with a door. When the walls heat up and the fire goes out, a person can go inside 
the chamber. His body will be warmed from all sides, from below and from above. The clay will emit a very healthy and beneficial warmth for the person.”</p><p>“Yes, of course, that 
is a very healthy emission,” Anastasia said, now thoughtfully, “especially if you were to place a vessel there containing an infusion of medicinal herbs. Information about 
such a bath house did not exist in the Universe, and you could not have received it. This means you have added this information to the Universe, and now you…”</p><p>I looked at the 
little mountain of earth in the mock-up and imagined this bath house, and around it – flower beds, roses, and the bank of a beautiful pond. And even just from imagining it, 
some kind of most beneficial warmth really was spreading through my body. I intuitively understood that Volodya had thought up something that hadn’t previously existed. That 
made me extraordinarily joyful, as if my body and Soul were both rejoicing.</p><p>I began thinking once again about the overall homestead project, about how awesome and beautiful 
Anastasia was, both in body and mind. Naturally, she isn’t indifferent to this project and perhaps she deserved more credit than anyone for solving the problem of how to 
improve the soil productivity, a problem that we’d previously considered hopeless. Wow, what a thing to think of – raising a regular compost pit just above ground level and 
turning it into a living fence. That meant she’d agreed to help after all, her principles notwithstanding. To help in some discreet way. I walked up to Anastasia and softly 
whispered:</p><p>“You’re the one who thought all of this up. You found the solution. Thank you, Anastasia.”</p><p>“We thought it up together, Vladimir,” Anastasia said, also in a whisper, 
“and perhaps those three hundred families you spoke of deserve the most credit.”</p><p>“But they weren’t here while we were thinking.”</p><p>“Perhaps they weren’t here, but they were 
there, on their hectares, also contemplating the best steps to take. And just imagine, Vladimir, what if they didn’t exist at all? Would you have thrown the whole family into 
a tizzy? Would you really have racked your brains so and demanded with such agitation that we find a solution? If they did not exist, you might not have given this question 
the slightest of thoughts. Perhaps they, these three hundred families are the main figures behind this project.”</p><p>“Yes, I agree. We created it all together, and I thank you 
even more for that ‘together’, Anastasia.” And then I added, “And thank you, too, for the eternity you’ve given me. I was at the spot where you hid the empty bottle.”</p><p>Anastasia added, with slightly downcast eyes:</p><p>“And the stick.”</p><p>“And the stick,” I confirmed, and started laughing.</p><p>Anastasia also started laughing, a rolling, light-hearted 
laughter, and even little Nastenka began hopping around near the mock-up, swinging her little hands and laughing. Only Volodya, indifferent to what was going on, was still 
looking intently and thoughtfully at the mock-up.</p><p>And I suddenly felt unbearably sorry for my son. Despite the fact that he’d managed to think up the extraordinary bath house, 
he – naturally, of course – still considered that he hadn’t managed the task Anastasia had set for him.</p><p>And he probably felt uncomfortable before me, too, for not listening to 
me, for arguing that we’d get along without Anastasia. He really had tried, but … I wanted to support him somehow, cheer him up. But how could I do that? I didn’t know.</p><p>Volodya was looking at the mock-up intently, most likely trying to come up with something else of his own in it. He didn’t understand that we’d already come up with what was 
most important.</p><p>Late in the evening, before going to sleep, I asked Anastasia:</p><p>“But where do Volodya and Nastenka sleep?”</p><p>“In various spots,” Anastasia replied. “Nastenka will 
sleep with me sometimes. Why are you inquiring about this, Vladimir?”</p><p>“Oh, no reason. I just wanted to talk with Volodya about something.”</p><p>“Then call him.”</p><p>“How do I call him? 
Do I shout, or what?”</p><p>“Just call him. He’ll hear.”</p><p>I called him. And a short time later, I saw our son coming in my direction. As before, he was intent as could be. When 
Volodya got closer to me, I asked him:</p><p>“Volodya, when did you come up with the mountain of clay being a bath house, and why didn’t you tell me about that earlier?”</p><p>“I decided 
to say that when Mama began criticizing our design and the clay mountain in our design. I decided to call it a bath house because you, Papa, told me, ‘First of all we need to 
build the outhouse and the bath house on the plot.’ The mountain was a bit too large to be an outhouse, and I decided to call it a bath house.”</p><p>“But then you began talking 
about how it would be arranged and used. Did you think that up on the fly, just like that, or maybe you’re able to use the Universal information after all, like Mama?”</p><p>“I 
can’t do it the way Mama does, Papa, but it’s possible that there’s some benefit in that, too. What I’m unable to receive information about – I try to quickly think that up 
on my own, and sometimes that works.”</p><p>“I’ll say! It works like a charm! You’re a real inventor. I can’t get your invention out of my mind. I’ve even decided to make up a 
working model when I get back. I’ll buy a clay pitcher, put a hole in its base and cover its mouth with a cover of some sort with a hole for a pipe. I’ll light a candle 
inside it and leave it for an hour or two – instead of a fire – so we can see how it’ll heat up. Only a pitcher’s walls are thin, so we won’t have a perfectly accurate 
model.”</p><p>“Papa, apply a layer of clay around the pitcher, and the model will be more accurate.”</p><p>“Perfect, I’ll apply a layer of clay. Now, Volodya, please forgive me, well, you 
know, for being so hot-headed and saying that you have nothing to think with. Don’t be angry with me.”</p><p>“I’ve never gotten angry at you, Papa,” he answered calmly.</p><p>“And I’m not 
angry at Mama. And of course you got it, that she was only pretending that we’d thought up that earthen mound along the hectare’s perimeter – actually, she and Nastenka gave 
us a hint.”</p><p>“Yes, Papa, I got all that.”</p><p>“But it’s not important, who thought it up. What’s important is that the problem with the soil has now been solved. Good for Anastasia, 
right, Volodya?”</p><p>“Mama challenged us to a duel, Papa.”</p><p>“A duel? She challenged us? I had that kind of feeling when you were standing opposite each other. Is that a kind of 
game, Volodya? To develop the mind, is that it?”</p><p>“You could say it’s a game, but to be more precise, it’s a duel.”</p><p>“That’s not a fair duel. Anastasia possesses information as 
broad as the Universe, but we don’t have that opportunity. How can we duel under those circumstances?”</p><p>Volodya heard out my arguments and replied, with calm confidence:</p><p>“I have 
accepted the challenge, Papa.”</p><p>“Well, there was no point in accepting it. The chances are a hundred percent you’ll lose! Then you’ll get upset, the way you got upset today. I 
saw the way you were sitting there all upset, hanging your head when Anastasia was talking about the earthen mound, about the home in the middle and the back yard. And here 
you’ll get even more upset.”</p><p>“I must not lose, Papa. If I lose, it will make Mama sad.”</p><p>“Well, then she should surrender to you in some non-obvious way, so that she herself 
won’t be sad afterwards.”</p><p>“Mama can’t surrender.”</p><p>“Oh, Volodya, Volodya – sometimes it seems to me you’re a bit foolhardy. Okay, what’s happened has happened. You go get some 
sleep, Volodya. I’ll go, too, and I’ll think about how best to situate the home on the hectare. Maybe I’ll think of something.”</p><p>“Yes, Papa, you need to get a good sleep. I 
wish you a serene sleep, Papa.”</p><p>My son and I went our separate ways, but I couldn’t go to sleep right away. I said to Anastasia:</p><p>“Don’t wait up for me. Go to sleep on your own, 
Anastasia. I need to think about something for a bit.”</p><p>I walked around by the entrance to the dug-out in the light of the white Siberian night, thinking about how to help 
Volodya. From time to time I’d look at the sleeping Anastasia. She was sleeping on her side, curled up into a ball with her palm beneath her head, and smiling a little about 
something in her sleep.</p><p>She’s smiling like a child, the gentle beauty. But the day before – she sure had ripped our layout apart mercilessly! She’d called the spot where we’d 
put the home in the mock-up incorrect. Half the hectare had ended up as the back yard, she’d said. Of course, that really was the case. I needed to recall how homes were 
situated in the landscape design journals. Of course, Volodya wouldn’t be able to solve the problem of where to situate the structures, since he didn’t have the information. 
I’d have to think everything through. Otherwise, he’d lose all confidence in his own capabilities. I had such a strong desire to help my son that I sensed that I wouldn’t 
fall asleep until I’d thought up something useful. I’ve seen lots of country homes with various structures on plots of land, so that meant it was up to me to find the correct 
solution. But it wasn’t coming. Most of the houses I’d had occasion to see basically had their windows looking out over the driveway.</p><p>It was getting long past midnight, but I 
was still walking back and forth along the dug-out, sorting through various options for situating the home and farmyard structures.</p><p>And suddenly it came to me! It came to me 
just like that, somehow, as if it just erupted, and I really liked what came to me. Well, I’ll give her an answer tomorrow! Yeah, I’ll answer her!</p><p>I started imagining the way, 
the next day, I’d answer Anastasia’s remark about the back yard. I’d start in an off-hand way: “Anastasia, you were saying something here yesterday about the spot where we 
put the home, about some kind of back yard.”</p><p>“Yes,” she’d say. “I was saying that half of your hectare has ended up in the back yard.”</p><p>“That’s not true, Anastasia. That’s not 
the way it all is. You just failed to notice a little indentation on the mock-up. That’s a veranda that goes around the whole home. When it’s hot, we’ll sit on the shady side 
with our friends, along the wall that’s on the other side of the house from the entrance. We’ll sit and admire the garden and the flower beds, and thus you don’t have any 
back yard. An open veranda runs all around the house.”</p><p>“Yes, that’s true,” Anastasia will say. “I didn’t notice that.”</p><p>I decided I’d come up with something good, and quietly, 
so as not to disturb her sleep, I laid down on the fragrant bed next to the sleeping beauty.</p><p>During the night I had a strange dream about the bath house. It was as if I was 
walking into it and closing the door behind me. And the bath house lifted up off the ground and was flying into the sky, picking up more and more speed.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1026>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>26. The Fiery Bird</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>I woke 
up around eleven o’clock. Most likely I’d slept so long due to the two days of non-stop mental exertion. As soon as I woke up, I once again wanted to see my son and talk with 
him about the bath house. To tell him this wasn’t simply a bath house. It was a multi-function structure. It could serve as an outdoor fireplace, where it would be great to 
sit with your friends or family. You could also dry clothing, mushrooms and many other things in it. You could bake bread and prepare tasty dishes in it. And it goes without 
saying that you could treat what ails you in it by warming your body with its extraordinary heat. I reflected this way as I walked to the spot where the homestead mock-up 
was, on the lakeshore. When I came out of the bushes, this is the picture that presented itself to me.</p><p>Alongside the mock-up of the homestead lay an exhausted she-wolf, her 
legs smeared with clay. About two meters from the she-wolf, a she-bear was shifting from foot to foot in a small pit – she was working the clay. Volodya, kneeling, was using 
the palms of his hands to smooth out the bath house he’d constructed of clay on the bank of the pond. But no! You’d be hard pressed to call what I saw there a bath house. 
Even my fear at the presence of the she-bear and she wolf took a back seat, and I went up closer.</p><p>The central part of what Volodya had constructed resembled the head and torso 
of some unusual kind of bird. At the base was a small opening – the entrance to the interior room. Extending out from the central part of the structure that resembled an 
unusual bird were its two wings. They were embracing the space. Beneath one of the wings sat a man and a woman who resembled Anastasia and me. A little girl was playing in 
the middle. It was a cloudy day – the sun would by turns shine brightly and hide behind the clouds. The shadows’ play created the impression of a live bird that might lift 
off in flight as soon as the people went inside it.</p><p>I could hear Anastasia’s voice – she had just come out onto the lakeshore, holding little Nastenka by the hand. “This is 
simply a hallucination of some kind. Since morning I have been thinking of nothing but your bath house. There’s something extraordinary in it. I need to figure it out. I 
even…”</p><p>Anastasia stopped speaking, without finishing her sentence. She caught sight of what our son had constructed. Together with Nastenka, she went up closer, took a seat by 
the mock-up, put her arms around her little daughter and for a short while silently looked at the extraordinarily beautiful sculpture. And she began speaking, as if thinking 
aloud:</p><p>“Earth, fire, water, air, light rays, man. And all of it in one bird. And such an extraordinary one – a bird resembling an eagle teaching its sons to fly.”</p><p>“This 
structure is multi-functional,” I remarked to Anastasia, pleased by her delight. “You can not only warm up with your friends in it, but bake bread, too, prepare good and dry 
mushrooms and other things, too.”</p><p>“Yes, you can. But you shouldn’t do that with friends. Only with close relatives, but more often on your own.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Vladimir, this apparatus 
might possibly function more effectively than a dolmen. You can meditate inside it.”</p><p>During our conversation, Nastenka went up to the mock-up and for some reason was 
diligently poking at it with her finger.</p><p>“Look, Anastasia, is our daughter Nastenka trying to destroy the mock-up?”</p><p>“I think she wants to show that we need to make some small 
round openings in the cupola, make little windows that look out onto the four sides of the world. Then in the day it will be light inside, and at night the stars will be 
visible.”</p><p>“And I planned to make a round window in the middle, too,” Volodya added.</p><p>Nastenka, as if she’d understood that everyone agreed with her, stopped boring holes in the 
clay with her finger and slowly – as if reflecting on some thoughts of her own – headed off in the direction of the forest.</p><p>“Anasta,” I said in her direction, without even 
understanding why myself.</p><p>Nastenka turned and looked at me intently. The breeze rearranged a lock of her hair and uncovered a birthmark on her forehead – it looked like a 
little star. The little girl smiled and continued her journey, whose goal was known to her alone.</p><p>Anastasia continued silently examining what Volodya had constructed. She was 
trying to comprehend something. Never before had I seen her so concentrated. Finally Anastasia began speaking, as if reasoning aloud:</p><p>“Five illuminated circles, and they will 
move in accord with the movement of the sun and of the moon. They will move across the walls and the floor of the interior oval or round chamber. That is very important. They 
will illuminate the person.”</p><p>“Tell me, Anastasia. What about the person who’s inside this structure – will he be able to restore his health, just the way he’d be able to in 
any bath house?”</p><p>“It will function more effectively than any bath house, or than all of them put together. The heated clay gives off rays that are very beneficial for a 
person. Blood will move more quickly through the veins, and the internal organs will warm and be cleansed.”</p><p>“But specifically, what illnesses can be treated with a session in 
this structure?”</p><p>“A person will receive a healthy effect on his entire organism. Thus it follows that it will be easier for the organism to fight off any illness, but it is 
possible to focus the energies and direct them to a specific organ.”</p><p>“Well, take the kidneys, for example. How can you treat them? How can you direct the energies?”</p><p>“You need 
to pour clean sand into a wooden tub, roll the tub into the center of the oval chamber, and when the sand has heated up, bury yourself in it. Only your head should remain 
outside. Before this you should eat a good amount of watermelon. The sand is very good at absorbing sweat that comes out of the pores.”</p><p>“Well, sweat comes out of a person’s 
body even in a regular bath house. Why do you need to lie in the sand?”</p><p>“But Vladimir, look – in a regular bath house, where does the sweat which comes, for example, out of 
the upper pores on the back, or the chest or the shoulders flow away to?”</p><p>“What do you mean, where? It runs down.”</p><p>“Precisely. It runs down, along the other pores, thereby 
hindering them from perspiring. The dry, warmed sand is very good at absorbing moisture, and the sweat will flow out directly into the sand, rather than down along the 
person’s entire body. It is also good, when you’re in the sand bath, to drink a medicinal herbal infusion.”</p><p>“And what about the liver? How can you treat that?”</p><p>“Does this mean 
your liver is bothering you, too, Vladimir?”</p><p>“Yes, it bothers everybody.”</p><p>“Effective treatment of the liver in this structure can be carried out at three o’clock in the 
morning.”</p><p>“Why precisely at three?”</p><p>“At that time all the other organs help the liver cleanse itself of all the accumulated impurities within it. As well, if you place your 
palm on the spot where the liver is located and think of it with gratitude, and in your thoughts say to it ‘Thank you!’ then it will stir and begin to restore itself.”</p><p>“How 
can that be – restore itself? What, is it alive, or something?”</p><p>“Of course it’s alive, just as are all the organs of your body.”</p><p>“But why can you meditate well in this 
structure? You said it might possibly be more powerful than in a dolmen.”</p><p>“People who entered into a dolmen would go off into internal meditation. They were trying to transmit 
information to their descendants. The dolmen aided them in this. This unique apparatus is even more effective than a dolmen: it can help transmit information, but it can 
also, under certain conditions, receive information from the Universe and transmit it to the person inside, while hiding away deep within itself any negative information…”</p><p>Anastasia suddenly fell silent, looked at our son and asked him:</p><p>“Are you wanting to add something else to the homestead design, Volodya?”</p><p>“Yes, Mama. But first I want to be 
alone for a bit and think.”</p><p>“All right. We won’t hinder you.”</p><p>She took Nastenka by the hand, intending to leave. But Volodya said:</p><p>“Let Nastenka stay.”</p><p>And Nastenka, hearing her 
brother’s request, quickly slipped out of Anastasia’s arms and headed for the mock-up. Anastasia and I left.</p><p> <div class=chapter id=1027>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>27. Don't Judge too Harshly</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Anastasia and I decided to go 
over to her grandfather’s glade. I’d long been asking her to show me this spot, his glade, and besides that, I wanted to have a chat with him. According to what Anastasia has 
said, it would take no less than three hours to walk to her grandfather’s glade. Consequently, such a hike might take up an entire day, but it stretched out to two days.</p><p>Even 
as we made our way through the taiga to her grandfather’s glade, Anastasia and I spoke about homesteads.</p><p>“You know, Anastasia, many people who build family homesteads feel 
they shouldn’t run electricity to their homestead or use all kinds of technology. Others do use it.”</p><p>“And what do you think, Vladimir?”</p><p>“I think that at the beginning stage, 
you can’t get along without technology and even without professional builders.”</p><p>“You might possibly be right, Vladimir. Let the technical means that have accumulated over the 
centuries be used for good. A unity of opposites will result. But I think we must design life so that in the future we will gradually do without them.”</p><p>For some time I walked 
silently behind Anastasia. I was stepping over the fallen trunks of old trees, skirting thickets of bushes along the invisible path and thinking my own thoughts, and maybe 
for that reason, I fell a bit behind. I even lost sight of her. But then, after I’d taken a few more steps, I heard Anastasia’s voice.</p><p>“You must be tired, Vladimir. We can 
take a rest. Let’s take a seat.”</p><p>I agreed. “Let’s. This isn’t the easiest path. We’ve only been walking an hour, but it feels as if we’ve gone ten kilometers.”</p><p>We sat down on a 
tree trunk. Anastasia held out a handful of currants to me that she’d collected along the way. I silently ate the delicious berries from the Siberian taiga and continued to 
think about my unpleasant situation. Then I decided to tell Anastasia about it.</p><p>“Anastasia, it so happens that for a number of years now I’ve been thinking about a situation I 
find unpleasant. In one of the books I told about the inception of Christianity in Rus and included historical facts and information from museums. And I ended up with 
negative information. This whole inception looked like a takeover of Russia. It seemed as if I’d laid out all the accurate facts and conclusions, but now I have an unpleasant 
feeling in my heart, and for years, now, I’ve been tormented by doubts.”</p><p>“Why unpleasant, Vladimir? Is it because certain representatives of the Church have been responding 
badly to you?”</p><p>“That’s not it – I’m already used to that. It’s something else I just can’t figure out.”</p><p>“What is it, Vladimir?”</p><p>“When I wrote about the baptism of Rus in such 
negative terms, then it ended up that I was saying something negative not about some specific person, but about everyone, all at once. Only afterwards did I get that no way I 
should have done that.”</p><p>“And how did you come to that understanding, Vladimir?”</p><p>“I spent the best years of my childhood at my grandparents’ place in the village of Kuznichi. I 
remember lots of details from living there. I remember that there, in the little Ukrainian hut, on a table in the corner, were Orthodox icons. My grandmother would decorate 
them with an embroidered towel and light a little lamp.</p><p>“I also remember the way my mom would attend church, even with her ailing legs. I often recall my spiritual father, 
Father Feodorit, the archpriest of Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra monastery. To this day, I still keep the Bible he gave me.</p><p>“And so it turns out that by speaking out negatively 
about Christianity, I was speaking out negatively about my grandparents, my mother and my spiritual father Feodorit. Well, and maybe about many good and worthy people, too. 
When I realized all this, then the first chance I got, I appeared on television, on Channel One, and apologized to the Church. But I didn’t feel much better after I did that. 
What else do you think I need to do to expiate my guilt before the people close to me? And before myself, too, maybe.”</p><p>“I think you need to fully comprehend everything and 
summon up a positive image that will eclipse the negative.”</p><p>“Of course, it’s easy to say ‘comprehend everything’ – I’ve been trying to do that for more than a year, and I’m 
not doing such a great job. But tell me, how do you feel about religions? Maybe you prefer some, and disavow or even reject some other, false ones?”</p><p>“Vladimir, I don’t 
understand what meaning you assign to the word ‘disavow,’ but I will try to show you the links in your family chain. Take this twig here. That will serve as your sabre for 
severing those links of the chain that you disavow.”</p><p>A depiction of a long chain of people holding hands arose in the space. The people of the first group wore crosses and 
little icons around their necks.</p><p>“Do you see, Vladimir? These are your relatives of the Orthodox faith. And those wearing turbans are Muslims. They also figure in your 
genealogy. And now here is a large group of people who today are called pagans. Next, holding hands, come your forbears from the Vedic period. Behind them come the blurred 
outlines of people of the first race, and we can also say of them that these are people from the first civilization on earth. They are blurry because information regarding 
them has not been articulated in the space, but your relatives are present there, too.</p><p>“The first person in this family chain was created by God, and he even now holds the 
hand of God. In all who follow also exists a particle of God. One day it will come to pass that the next person born of your line will come to know all and will sense 
everyone. He will also link hands with God. It may be that this will be you, or it may be your great-granddaughters. The circle will be formed. The circle – Alpha and Omega 
and Alpha once more.</p><p>“But now think and tell me, which of these groups of people would you like to remove from the chain?”</p><p>“I have to think about which one… Wait, Anastasia. 
Wait. But if I remove even one group of people, then, you know, the chain will be broken.”</p><p>“Of course, it will be broken.”</p><p>“And if it is broken, then the person who breaks it 
can never come to know God, link hands with him and form the circle.”</p><p>“I also think this, that he will be unable to do this.”</p><p>“So what does that mean? Should a person accept 
absolutely all religions?”</p><p>“Which religion to accept – that is the choice of each person, but I think we should disavow nothing from the path humanity has followed. It’s 
possible that all that occurred in the past is essential for today’s awareness. What you consider to be good is essential to accept. That which to your mind appears negative 
is essential simply to know, in order that it should not recur going forward. But not to be rejected.”</p><p>“But what about if you don’t know? Will it necessarily have to recur, 
and in the very same way?”</p><p>“Yes, it will recur. There will come a prophet who seems the bearer of the new. Those who have forgotten will hark unto him in delight, not knowing 
that in doing so they create nothing new.”</p><p>“But really, it’s impossible to know with precision everything that has happened to mankind since the time of creation. Historians 
distort even the most recent historical events to curry favor with those in power.”</p><p>“Within you, Vladimir, and within each person alive on Earth there exists a particle 
containing all information of your family line, from creation up to the present day.”</p><p>“I understand – this information is stored in each person on the genetic level, but how 
can we learn to make use of it? That’s the question.”</p><p>“By not disavowing and not rejecting even a smidgen of your particle.”</p><p>“But nobody has the least intention of rejecting 
their own particle.”</p><p>“When you disavow information about the past that has come to you from outside, you at the same time reject that particle that is within you.”</p><p>“But what 
about if this information is false?”</p><p>“The particle with false information is also within you. It has been preserved so that you might gain insight into the lie.”</p><p>“But 
Anastasia, really, you were the one who showed me and told me about how the black monks killed the Vedic Russian family who didn’t want to betray their faith and their way of 
life. I wrote about that in a book. The image of the Vedic Russians turned out very powerfully – that’s what many people have said. And I often recall it. Especially the 
picture when the wounded Vedic Russian, the artist, is lying under the pine tree, clutching to his chest the figurine he’d carved of the woman he loved. He’d loved her his 
whole life, but she’d married another. He kept on loving her, hiding his love. Only, when he’d carve figurines, they’d always end up looking like her.</p><p>“He, an old elder, 
entered into battle with a whole enemy detachment, in order to lead them away from the family of the woman he loved, and he was wounded. And I wrote your words: ‘The Vedic 
Russian lay on the grass and did not moan. A small stream of blood flowed from his chest. The wooden pine tree did not know how to cry…’ Well, do you remember?”</p><p>“Yes, 
Vladimir, I remember this emotional scene.”</p><p>“Well, so after this picture, then how can I – or someone else – not reject the black monks?”</p><p>“Tell me, Vladimir who you feel 
yourself to be, that wounded Vedic Russian or the black monk?”</p><p>“Me? Who am I? That means that’s why you showed this… To determine… But what’s this got to do with me?”</p><p>“Back 
there, in the past, in that picture – your forbears were there. Who were they? What do you think, Vladimir?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I’d like it if they were the Vedic Russians. Of 
course they were the Vedic Russians! Because the black monks came to Rus from a different state. Tell me, Anastasia, have I understood all this correctly? Tell me!”</p><p>“Vladimir, 
don’t get agitated. Take in the information calmly. Your ancestors really were Vedic Russians. But the screeching black monk, too, was your ancestor.</p><p>“Everything arose from 
the Whole, and this means all are brothers. Forgetting this, peoples fight amongst themselves, thereby destroying within their ‘opponent’ their own selves. It was this way, 
perhaps, for a reason. With the beginning of the new millennium, a new era has arrived as a new awareness of existence on Earth. The era of the beautiful transformation of 
the Earth.”</p><p>“It’s arrived? It’s already arrived? … Basically, I have a feeling inside me, too, that something new is going on in the world, especially when I see the way 
people are setting up entire settlements of family homesteads in deserted spaces. Are they the ones who will lead the new era forward?”</p><p>“Their awareness and feelings represent 
something new for the world.”</p><p>“But on the other hand, you watch the news on television, and everything there is just the same as it’s been – right off the bat, they talk about 
who among the leaders met with whom, and how much oil costs, and how many years now have they been harping on about an economic crisis, but they don’t suggest anything of 
significant.”</p><p>“On television, Vladimir, you are seeing news of the past life. The Universe is already alive through different dimensions. Commit everything from the past to 
memory. Leave nothing out. Take with you your ancestors’ prayer-fed strength.”</p><p>“How am I to understand that? What does ‘prayer-fed strength’ mean? What does it look like?”</p><p>“From generation to generation, your ancestors would look upon an Orthodox icon each day, pray to it and dedicate to it their thoughts, their hopes and their requests. It 
would harken unto them and try to help, and with each day, the icon itself would grow stronger. It will help you, and has helped already. As well, esteem the rosary and the 
Koran that were given to you by the Grand Mufti of the Muslims. And the bible of your Father Feodorit. Remember with reverence the day when you appeared before people in the 
great Christ the Savior Cathedral. And the day when, in the most beautiful Lyalya Tyulpan Mosque, you sat before the people who had crowded into the hall, at a table, and 
alongside you were an Orthodox priest and a rabbi. You spoke of homesteads. Ecologists spoke in support of you. Do you recall that day?”</p><p>“Yes, I do recall. The Grand Mufti 
organized that event, and people of various faiths came to the mosque then, and they were all grateful to him. But I remember something different, too. I remember the 
slanderous articles in the press. I remember how there was an orchestrated attempt to ridicule me on television, on Channel One.”</p><p>“Perhaps it is necessary, this slander 
directed toward you?”</p><p>“Necessary? For what? What are you saying, Anastasia?”</p><p>“You enter into a palace and a temple. A hero? Yes! Only you were unable to bear up beneath the 
brass trumpets and the fanfare of speech. How can you be saved from your self? By means of yourself?”</p><p>“Come on, I have no self and no pridefulness. Only fatigue.”</p><p>“So that 
means that it was due to fatigue, Vladimir, that one day, when you appeared in hall packed with readers in the capital of Belarus, you began to eject the bishop from the 
church publicly. That was due to fatigue?”</p><p>“Oh, I wasn’t serious about that. They told me before my appearance, that he…”</p><p>“And the crowd applauded you. The collective thought 
was energized and took off.”</p><p>“And what’s up now with the bishop?”</p><p>“But we are speaking not about him right now, Vladimir, but rather, about you. You wanted to understand how 
you feel about religions, to get a feel for this and figure it out.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You must do this only yourself, but I will tell you of future events. Perhaps the information 
concerning them will help you.</p><p>“It will happen before long, that more than a hundred and fifty leaders of various countries will come together. One question will they address, 
with scientists taking part: how to reduce the amount of harmful gases that are emitted into the atmosphere by human deeds. Gases that threaten the planet with disaster. But 
the hundred and fifty leaders of the Earth will be unable to make a decision that will save us, and they will go their separate ways. And the harmful gas created by mankind 
will continue to kill the planet.* What can you say about such a situation, Vladimir?”</p><p>“What can I possibly say here? Heads of state have come together numerous times to solve 
the question of how to improve the ecological situation, but to no end. Most people don’t pay any attention to these meetings any more.”</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>“Well, because not a 
single state has announced any workable proposals. And if there aren’t any workable proposals on the agenda, then what’s the use of meeting? It only makes people laugh.”</p><p>“And 
what would you consider a workable proposal?”</p><p>“The kind of proposal where the majority of people on Earth will change their life’s priorities. The desire will arise to perfect 
one’s dwelling land, instead of working at harmful manufacturing plants to get money to subsist on. No ruler is in a position to stop these harmful manufacturing plants, 
because unemployment will arise and there will be riots, and his power will end up being threatened.”</p><p>* Author’s note: In 2009, a climate summit of heads of state was held in 
Copenhagen from December 7-18, regarding capping and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Representatives of 192 countries participated in the summit.</p><p>“That means that heads of state are not in a position to stop a global disaster. But perhaps different authorities, spiritual authorities, are capable of doing this. The 
patriarchs of all the religions will come together, give their word before each other that they will call upon their congregations to perfect the earth’s dwelling land.”</p><p>“Yes! 
Exactly! They’d be able to deal with this question more effectively and have an effect on the people and the authorities at the same time.”</p><p>“And so that means that religions 
are important and needed. What do you think, Vladimir?”</p><p>“Turns out, they’re important and needed. And it would be great if they could all together direct their efforts toward 
perfecting both the spiritual and material dwelling land. But we need specifics here, too. Your plan, Anastasia, is unsurpassed in terms of specifics, and people’s hearts and 
souls everywhere are embracing it. But there is one circumstance that calls into question how viable it is.”</p><p>“What circumstance is that?”</p><p>“There’s no doubt that the way of life 
for a family on the family homestead that you’ve shown is greatly superior to today’s way of life for people in cities and rural areas. And even now, the number of families 
living this way – without any support whatsoever from the government – is growing steadily with each year. And there might come a time when the majority of the Earth’s 
population will want to have their own family homesteads and live on them. And at that point, there won’t be enough hectares for every family that wants one. Even now, people 
are talking about how a portion of the population needs to be eradicated due to the fact that there’s not enough living space and natural resources. According to these 
rumors, there should remain on Earth the so-called Golden Billion, plus two or three billion people who serve them. The Earth’s population is now six billion, and people are 
already raising the question of restricting births, like, say, China, where one billion, three hundred million people live in an area comprising 9.6 million square 
kilometers.</p><p>“If people’s way of life begins to change in accord with your plan, then people’s life expectancy will increase. It’s a completely obvious and undisputed fact, 
that the life expectancy for a person living on a family homestead, assuming he has no harmful habits – here I’m talking about drinking, smoking and others – has an excellent 
diet, clean air and healthy water, will, on average, be twice as long.</p><p>“A family living on a family homestead will want to have children, and such families have a 
significantly greater desire to bear children than those living in modern cities. So it follows that before long, new families won’t be able to get a hectare to build a 
family homestead.</p><p>“I understand that there must be some way out of this. When God was thinking of all that’s beautiful, he can’t have set up this kind of dead-end situation 
that would incite people to battle for living space. Your grandfather has said it’s absurd and futile to explore outer space using current methods, and that there’s another 
method – he calls it psychoteleportation. But no matter how much you think about it, it doesn’t appear possible to understand it in a detailed way. Basically, people don’t 
believe it exists, and science doesn’t say anything about it.”</p><p>“I am also aware that the psychoteleportation method of exploring outer space and the planets of other galaxies 
does exist. But no one in my family line is privy to the details or mechanisms of this method. I hope that people who are now establishing family homesteads, or their 
children or grandchildren will discover and grasp what helps it function. And this will definitely come to pass.</p><p>“But I understand your anxiety, too, Vladimir. If a person 
already today cannot see at least a part of this mechanism, he will remain anxious, due to his uncertainty regarding his family line. It is essential for us to grasp at least 
a part of it.</p><p>“I have been thinking tirelessly about it and searching, but I am finding only more and more confirmations all the time of its existence. It is possible that 
it’s essential for us to lay out the logical lines of reasoning, and to ask people who are familiar with science, with biology and programming, to think together. We must 
discover it all together.</p><p>“Vladimir, we’ve arrived,” announced Anastasia. “This is the home… This is Grandfather’s space.”</p><p> <div class=chapter id=1028>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>28. The Family Party</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Anastasia’s grandfather had always been notable for 
his unusual behavior. Even when speaking about very serious things, he’d always use humor or try to trip you up. And this time, too, he remained true to himself. When we came 
out into his glade, we saw Anastasia’s grandfather sitting beneath a cedar tree with his legs crossed, looking intently at a staff stuck into the ground before him. It was 
clear that he’d long since sensed we were on our way to him, and besides, he couldn’t help but sense our presence, but he paid no attention to us whatsoever. And even when we 
walked practically right up to him, he still didn’t turn in our direction and didn’t greet us. We stood there silently for three or four minutes. Then I whispered to 
Anastasia:</p><p>“You try saying something to him. Otherwise, we’re just going to keep standing here like this.”</p><p>“All right, Vladimir. But I’m trying to grasp what he’s up to here,” 
Anastasia replied, also speaking softly.</p><p>Then, all the same, she addressed her grandfather, saying:</p><p>“We arrived quite a while ago, Grandfather.”</p><p>And something totally odd 
happened next. Anastasia’s grandfather, turning to the staff, suddenly said:</p><p>“Due to unforeseen circumstances, I announce a fifteen-minute break.”</p><p>Then he stood up, led us off 
to the side and, completely serious, began explaining:</p><p>“I’m currently leading a party meeting of the Family Party. It will continue for another forty-five minutes or so, so 
you will have to wait.”</p><p>“How’s that, a party meeting?” I asked, surprised. “There’s nobody here. And besides, the Family Party hasn’t been constituted yet.”</p><p>‘Well, not by you, 
it hasn’t been,” Grandfather replied. “But I’ve constituted it for myself.”</p><p>“How’s that, you’ve constituted it? Who’s joining it?”</p><p>“I’m joining it all on my own. And I’m 
preparing for the convention.”</p><p>“What convention, if there’s only you in the party membership?”</p><p>“For now there is only I, but perhaps someone else will come along and constitute 
their own Family Party. And then we’ll convene.”</p><p>“But how the heck is something like that possible?”</p><p>“Well, you yourself said that we need to come up with something new. And so 
I came up with the idea that each person can lead his own Family Party, so no one will use his authority and position to put pressure on the party rank and file. And at the 
conventions, everyone will be equal.”</p><p>“And what kind of agenda do you have here at this meeting?”</p><p>“The government’s report on the work it’s done in connection with perfecting 
the dwelling land.”</p><p>“Well, and who do you have giving reports?”</p><p>“Various people. After the break I’ll be hearing from the Minister of Railway Transport.”</p><p>“But he’s not here!”</p><p>“Not for you, but for me he is.”</p><p>“How about him, does he know you’ll be hearing from him?” I wondered.</p><p>“He doesn’t know. And really, why should I take him away from his work?”</p><p>“But when and where will your convention take place?”</p><p>“When the organizers set the date.”</p><p>“What organizers?”</p><p>“Other Family Party leaders.”</p><p>Really, in spite of how comical 
Grandfather’s display was, I do think the idea of creating a Family Party, in which all are equal, deserves attention. The usual way of organizing a party won’t get us 
anywhere, except to something resembling the CPSU. And this is where I can see some grains of truth. Each person is free to act in accordance with his own heart and soul, 
rather than orders or a universal charter. Different party members can initiate the best actions and endeavors and advances. It seems to me that in this case you’ll end up 
with a lively community of people that develops on its own, in which each individual really can express his own initiative. As we took our leave of Grandfather, I said, 
matching his tone, and trying to be serious:</p><p>“From this day forward I also constitute my own family party.”</p><p>Why go on and on about it? It’s time for each of us to take action.</p><p>Further developments connected to Anastasia’s grandfather deserve a separate book, and I intend to tell about them at a later date.</p><p><div class=chapter id=1029>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>29. Exploring Virgin Planets</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>On our way back, as 
Anastasia and I were returning from seeing Grandfather, our conversation once again turned to the possible existence of a biological way for a person on Earth to explore 
other planets and galaxies. I reminded Anastasia:</p><p>“Anastasia, you mentioned that you think tirelessly about a biological way to explore other planets, and that you’re finding 
logical confirmations of its existence. Can you lay out these logical lines of reasoning?”</p><p>“We can begin now, together, to analyze the situation. Further on you can continue 
on your own.”</p><p>“All right, Anastasia, but you go ahead and start us off.”</p><p>“First of all it’s essential to authoritatively establish the first fact. All that has been created in 
the technocratic world existed and exists in a biological and significantly more perfected form. Do you agree with this, Vladimir? Do you understand how important it is to 
establish this understanding?”</p><p>“Of course, I agree. I’m not the only one who knows this. Many other people do, too. Man used to be able to do calculations in his head a lot 
better and faster – each person had his own inner calculator. Well, and so on. You can cite a great many examples here.</p><p>“The example I like most is a person’s birth. It’s the 
clearest and most striking example, because two methods exist simultaneously in the world now – the technocratic and the biological.</p><p>“The technocratic method is when 
scientists in a specialized institute take sperm from a man and an egg from a woman, mix them together in a test tube that they keep inside a special apparatus. They keep it 
at the necessary temperature and humidity, and basically, it takes a lot of fuss and resources. Now, the biological method is a lot simpler and more effective. A man and a 
woman in a bed… They enjoy themselves, and soon afterwards a person is born.”</p><p>“A good example, Vladimir, only, please, take note of one very important detail. Even so, when a 
person is created, even if it is via a technocratic method, what lies at the heart of him is the biological material.”</p><p>“Yes, of course, that’s what lies at his heart. You 
can’t get anything without the sperm and the egg.”</p><p>“And the biological method has no need to adopt anything from the technocratic world.”</p><p>“Agreed. Not a thing. Well, except for 
a bed. Although you can get along without a bed, too. Basically, Anastasia, I totally agree, and I get it – the biological alternatives are significantly more perfected than 
the technocratic. When the technocratic man thinks up his so-called inventions and brainchildren, he’s replacing existing and perfected biological mechanisms with primitive, 
technocratic ones. That situation is completely anti-rational.”</p><p>“And nonetheless, time and time again, human civilizations, losing all memory of their natural capabilities, 
have replaced them with primitive, technocratic alternatives.</p><p>“We are unable to imagine now, how one can get to another planet using a natural method. And in this very same 
way, people of a different civilization were unable to imagine the birth of a child in a non-technocratic way.</p><p>“Many women today cannot imagine giving birth to a child without 
others’ help, without a maternity ward and technocratic equipment. If we continue further along these lines, then more and more children will be born using surrogate 
mothers.</p><p>“Something resembling farms will arise, where women who have been artificially inseminated will be concentrated. Their whole lives, they will bear children and give 
them up. They will be provided with food and lodging, but they themselves – each one of them will see herself as an incubator for a human embryo. This has already happened in 
history, in one human civilization.</p><p>“In this same civilization, the practice of cloning of people was also developed. As a result, a person in this civilization was unaware 
that it was possible to give birth to a person through biological means. Lacking awareness of this, lacking this thought, a woman had no possibility of conceiving a child, no 
matter how much she entered into intimate relations with a man. Now, if a woman did become pregnant by natural means after all, this was considered pathological, and the 
human embryo was immediately destroyed or was removed and grown artificially.</p><p>“Vladimir, do you agree with the assertion that any technocratic achievement is preceded by a 
person’s act of losing the memory of his biological capabilities?”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“But now, tell me, can a person use a technocratic method to transfer an image, a photograph of his 
family homestead, for example, from one point on Earth to another, or into outer space?”</p><p>“Of course, he can, using a computer and the Internet. All he needs to do is choose an 
electronic address, scan this image into his computer, go onto the Internet and send it to the address he’s chosen, and it will come up there on the computer. You can print 
it off the other computer using a printer. You can also send it into space, too, if you know the spaceship’s electronic address. You can send it to the Moon, too, and you can 
send an image from the Moon to Earth. That’s already been done.”</p><p>“Good, Vladimir, very good. Only you have forgotten one very important detail. The most important.”</p><p>“Which 
one?”</p><p>“Before the person does all these various operations on the computer, the thought was born in him to send off the image.”</p><p>“I agree. I didn’t mention the thought because 
that goes without saying.”</p><p>“But now, tell me, can a person use a modern technocratic method to transfer not only an image, but an object, too, to all the points you named?”</p><p>“And object? I don’t think it’ll work with an object.” I thought about it for a brief time and then added, “Anastasia, I remembered that there are lathes that carve various 
designs out of wood, little sculptures, for example, under the direction of computer programs, and if you send the computer program tasked with carving out the little 
sculptures to a different continent via an electronic address, or to the Moon, then another computer there, if it’s hooked up to the same kind of lathe, will carve out very 
same little figure, and there will be two of them – one that my computer made and a second that the other computer will carve out. In that way, the little sculpture I have 
will be copied on a different continent, or on the Moon.”</p><p>“So it follows, that one can use a modern technocratic method to transfer or copy and recreate an object, even on a 
different planet?”</p><p>“Yes, one can.”</p><p>“But do you understand what this means, Vladimir?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“This means, that there exists a biological method for transferring an object from 
one planet to another, and this means it is a thousand times more perfected, simpler, and can be accessible to any person. The biological method requires the presence of no 
technology whatsoever. It is the human thought that is most important in it.”</p><p>“Yes, I agree, and in the case of creating a child, the most important thing is the thought, but 
a man who’s thought about creating a child needs a woman, too, and a woman who’s thought about a child needs a man. Together they materialize what they’ve thought.”</p><p>“Together 
they…</p><p>“Vladimir, the possibility of creation and birthing of a person by a man and a woman is the highest achievement. This means that it is possible – all the more so –for a 
person to create life on another planet using a biological method. For now it is unclear what components are necessary in order to materialize him.”</p><p>“Yes, Anastasia, a 
tremendous discovery. It would turn out to be tremendous, if you or someone else could find or discover these biological components.”</p><p>“We need to think. It would be possible 
to comprehend and sense much, were we to encounter that knowledge possessed by the people of the first civilization on Earth.”</p><p><div class=chapter id=1030>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>30. People of the First Civilisation</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br><img class=kumar src=https://www.ringingcedars.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-day-will-return-the-way-you-want-vk.com-kumar82.png></div></p><p> </p><p>“I infer, I 
surmise, and the logic of life confirms this, that they possessed potentials greater than did God Himself.”</p><p>“But who the heck are these mysterious ‘they’?”</p><p>“These are the 
children of God. People of the first earthly civilization.”</p><p>“The first civilization? Does that mean there were ones that came after? And how might the first civilization have 
differed from those that came after it?”</p><p>“In the direction of its development. Mankind, Vladimir, has not always followed the technocratic path into the dimension of anti-
rationality, toward disaster. In the beginning was the first civilization, which developed in a different direction. We will call it the biological path. They made use of all 
that was originally created by God. A person of this civilization would study the divine creations and, with their help, would perfect his dwelling land. The divine creations 
are perfected, but each generation must be more rational than the preceding one. Such is the way God programmed it.</p><p>“It could be no other way. Were it another way, God could 
not be called God, and His creations, lacking the potential for becoming perfected, would represent the end of creation. Man is the beginning of the great creation.</p><p>“And now 
it is taxing for us to even imagine what the first civilization achieved, what heights, in its divine development, and how the planet looked during the period of their 
material life.</p><p>“Naturally, people of the first earthly civilization might also have looked different than contemporary man on the outside, too. They had an ideal body build, 
and their physical health enabled them to hold within themselves immeasurably more energy than contemporary man is able to hold. Their original knowledge of the biological 
divine world that came from God, enabled them to perfect it.</p><p>“All the scientific and technological achievements existing today in the technocratic world existed for them in a 
significantly more perfected, biological form.”</p><p>“Where’s the proof that this civilization and their achievements existed?”</p><p>“If you see a grown person, Vladimir, do you really 
need proof of the fact that this person was at first an infant and then a child?”</p><p>“No, I don’t. The person himself serves as proof that he used to be a child.”</p><p>“In just that 
way, today’s human civilization, too, serves as proof that there existed the first. And this first one could not be technocratic.”</p><p>“All right, maybe it couldn’t, but we can 
see from historical evidence and archaeological digs that people of ancient civilizations who lived a hundred thousand years ago ran around in animal skins with clubs and 
hunted animals, as we’re told, and that they had trouble finding food for themselves.”</p><p>“Archaeologists are finding people of the post-disaster period of technocratic 
civilizations.</p><p>“Imagine, Vladimir, that on the earth is living a technocratic civilization, that it is achieving great heights in so-called technocratic development. But any 
technocratic path rends the planet Earth, impairs the ecology and disturbs the biosphere, and large-scale technology-induced disaster ensues. Those in power, or the elite, 
always know of its approach beforehand and make preparations to save themselves. One of the civilizations, for example, constructed, in near earth orbit, an entire 
technological complex of a size equaling two ocean liners. On it they saved themselves from the disastrous changes that had befallen the earth. But this technological complex 
could not hold the people indefinitely, for it itself was mortal. The people who were saving themselves from the earthly disaster held out on it for around sixty years. 
Children were born to them. But there came a time, when life on the artificial complex became impossible. The people, its inhabitants, began dying, and then the decision was 
made to return to Earth, and they returned. They landed in groups, in special capsules. On the Earth, which was cooling now after the great fire, grass was already growing up 
anew, and the animal world was coming back to life. Not all the people managed to end up in this kind of oasis. Those who ended up in the desert or on red-hot lava perished. 
Those who managed to land on a plot of land where life had been partially preserved, rejoiced at their luck.</p><p>“Now I will show you.</p><p>“Look, there they are – there are but six of 
them – coming out of their red-hot capsule. They are rejoicing at the little green grass and the air they can breathe. Here are two children, a little boy and a little girl. 
They’re examining a currant bush and the bugs on it with interest. And here is an elderly man without any hair at all. He’s returning to the capsule, and before long he 
carries a box out of it. There is food inside it. The person sets the box on the ground, looks at the little boy and the little girl by the currant bush and walks up to their 
mother, who is standing nearby.</p><p>“‘It’s best for you to go far away from this place and take the children with you. We have enough food left for no more than a week. Your 
husband has died and I am your distant relative, but I have no intention of protecting you when the fight for food begins.’</p><p>“‘Give us at least a day’s worth of food.’</p><p>“‘Take it 
yourself, but try to do it so no one will notice you, and leave quickly.’</p><p>“The woman walked up to the box on the ground, bent over as if adjusting her shoe, and quickly took 
three little tubes of some substance and hid them beneath her jumpsuit. Then she quickly walked up to her children and, saying something about wanting to show them some even 
more interesting bushes, led them off far away from the craft lying on the ground.</p><p>“The people who had returned to earth possessed knowledge of the technocratic world. They 
could use computers and satellite telephones, operate an automobile or a spaceship, but their knowledge was now absolutely useless and even hazardous. All communications and 
the majority of machines on earth had been destroyed. Many of those that remained were radioactive and posed a mortal danger.</p><p>“The mother who left with her son and daughter 
carried on her family line. And once again, for millennia, mankind developed in the technocratic direction. Archaeologists excavated huge ancient cities. They excavated the 
graves of the forbears, finding in them crude hunting weapons, and concluded that they were seeing primitive people at the beginning of their civilization. But they were 
seeing people at the end of their civilization. Archaeologists would sometimes find cave drawings of people dressed in pressurized suits. The scientific world put forth 
hypotheses that mankind arose from extraterrestrial beings, that in antiquity mankind had received knowledge from extraterrestrials. But, just as before, they did not even 
want to entertain the thought that in the cave drawings of beings in pressurized suits… they were seeing people at the end of their civilization.”</p><p>“But then where is the first 
civilization now?”</p><p>“It has disappeared. It disappeared suddenly, for some mysterious reason. At the moment of their disappearance, the people of the first civilization erased 
all information about their achievements from the Universal database. They did this in some inconceivable fashion. Why they took such steps, one can only infer and surmise.”</p><p>“Well, so what do you infer, Anastasia?”</p><p>“I infer that, perceiving themselves as in control of the fates of Universal worlds, they also recognized within themselves the germs 
of the anti-world, anti-rationality virus and understood that they lacked within themselves sufficient immunity to it. And at that point, they detonated themselves 
psychologically, along with their achievements, leaving on earth those who were more infected with the virus of anti-rationality and anti-world than the others. So that they 
could follow it to its conclusion and come to fully know the dimension of anti-rationality. And now we, the descendants of the first civilization, will come to know 
conclusively the essence of anti-rationality, and one instant before the planetary disaster, we will bring rationality and anti-rationality into balance within ourselves. All 
the achievements of the first earthly civilization will open up within us in a new and more perfected form.”</p><p>“But if, as you say, their knowledge will open up, does that mean 
they’re somewhere, that they exist?”</p><p>“They exist within each person.”</p><p>Anastasia suddenly broke off her tale and froze.</p><p>“What’s happened, Anastasia? Why did you stop talking and 
freeze?”</p><p>“Something has happened in the Universal space. I sense that, Vladimir. I sense the vibrations. Do you also?”</p><p>“I don’t sense a thing. Just some little breeze started 
to blow.”</p><p>“Yes, a breeze, but it’s variable.”</p><p>“Well, maybe it’s variable, but what of it? Did something bad happen, or something good?”</p><p>“I don’t know, Vladimir. Only one thing 
is clear: what has happened has disturbed the space.”</p><p>“But where did it happen?”</p><p>“On the shore of our lake, I think.”</p><p>“And what, are you saying the whole Universe reacted to 
this thing that happened?”</p><p>“It always reacts when interesting or unusual information appears.”</p><p>“Let’s run over to our lake as fast as we can, Anastasia.”</p><p>We set off walking at a 
fast clip. At times, when the taiga would allow me to, I tried to run. Only once did we sit down to rest, and then once again rushed toward the lake.</p><p>When we were already 
almost to the lake, I suddenly imagined what unpleasant things might be in store for our son, and I asked Anastasia to stop.</p><p>“Wait, Anastasia. Hear me out, try to understand. 
Volodya’s under the impression that you challenged us to a duel. Is that right?”</p><p>“Yes,” Anastasia replied calmly.</p><p>“I won’t going into it right now, about why it’s an unfair 
challenge. There’s no time. But I‘m asking you – please don’t criticize what Volodya has done during the two days we’ve been gone.</p><p>“It’s clear that he’s been working on the 
mock-up from dawn to dusk. He’s been trying. I know. I saw it when he and I were thinking over the design on our own. But he doesn’t have enough information. If you start 
criticizing his creation, he’ll be very upset. He’s said to me, ‘If I don’t win the duel, it will make Mama sad.’</p><p>“Can you imagine? He’ll try and try, so he doesn’t make you 
sad.”</p><p>“And you, too, Vladimir.”</p><p>“Yes. And me, too. But you and I – we’re grownups. We should understand that there’s simply nothing else he can add to the homestead design. The 
earthen wall around the perimeter was a brilliant idea, but it’s already been articulated, and the pond’s been settled and you haven’t rejected where we’ve put the home with 
the veranda all around it. What’s left? Flower beds, raised vegetable beds – that’s the small stuff. The technical construction details aren’t significant. You need to 
understand, Anastasia, there’s no room left there for creativity. I mean, you yourself have already done everything. You gave us a hint, and didn’t leave anything for our 

son. At least praise him for trying.”</p><p>“I cannot praise him just for trying. That would be humiliating praise.”</p><p>“Humiliating? But putting a child in a position where there’s no 
way out – that’s not humiliation? No, that’s not humiliation. It’s mockery.”</p><p>“Please believe me, Vladimir. I am not mocking our son, not at all. Within him are little parts of 
you and of me. Information and knowledge gathered by your ancestors and mine. He has been raised and taught by Grandfather and Great-grandfather. Our son’s capabilities are 
yet to be revealed, but I am certain that they are great.”</p><p>“Maybe they are great, but I’m trying to explain to you, that there’s no area left for creativity, for him to 
display them. The homestead design has already been created.”</p><p>“You feel it’s been created. But for a long time now, I’ve been under the impression that even so, neither you 
nor I, nor the people who are creating homesteads are aware of some key purpose of theirs. Many sense it intuitively, and for this reason the thought to create a family 
homestead draws people in. This thought is on the level of feelings. They are not fully clear or grasped. Something very important for the future and for eternity has not 
been grasped.</p><p>“From the moment of man’s creation and up to the present, within him has lain all that was created in the beginning, and they, the man-gods of the first 
civilization, are secreted away within each person, in the form of a small and perhaps microscopic particle. It’s possible that they can see or feel what is transpiring. When 
I excessively precipitously put our son in a difficult position in regard to you, it is possible that this particle responded, that it couldn’t help it, and perhaps the time 
has come… It is possible that Volodya senses, feels the knowledge stored within him. His structure, this fiery bird, turned out too extraordinary in its beauty and 
function.”</p><p>“Anastasia, please understand, you’re asking the impossible. You want our son to explain something to you or to create something, but you yourself don’t know what, 
exactly. You only feel some new potentials for the family homestead, but Volodya might not even know about your feelings.”</p><p>“My feelings lie within our son, too, Vladimir.”</p><p>I 
was walking behind Anastasia, fully aware that she wasn’t going to pull any punches with our son or praise him for no good reason. And she might even start criticizing him, 
too. But I wasn’t going to criticize him. I made a firm decision: I had to find some kind of words to say to cheer him up and praise him for trying.</p><p>I fell a bit behind 
Anastasia. When I came out of the taiga, I saw that she, standing by a cedar tree, was focused on peering from afar at what was transpiring on the shore. And on the sandy 
shore of the taiga lake, surrounded by centuries-old cedars, Volodya was making some kind of incomprehensible structure. It was a simple square or rectangle that framed the 
earthen mound and enclosed it on both sides with little clay walls. The little walls at the corners were white and higher than along the sides. On the square’s inner edge was 
the pond, and next to it his unique bird, and in the middle of square, right on the sand, sat Nastenka. That was it. I understood that Anastasia wouldn’t be praising Volodya. 
There was nothing to praise him for. He’d made the bird before, and he basically wasn’t the one who’d come up with the earthen mound. Either he hadn’t had time to construct 
the home and farmyard structures, or he didn’t know where to situate them. To tell the truth, the square was a little bit strange. I turned to Anastasia and said:</p><p>“Volodya 
hasn’t managed to do anything special, and since that’s the case, there’s nothing here to criticize.”</p><p>But Anastasia gave me no answer and didn’t even turn in my direction. It 
was at if she had lost track of everything and was focused on studying the square.</p><p>I set off in the direction of the square my son was fussing with, but here’s where something 
incomprehensible happened. When I came to within a few steps of the homestead mock-up, I stopped. I didn’t have the strength to move further. It was as if the space around me 
was suddenly transformed. On the outside, everything was still the same, but my sensations… Unbelievably pleasant sensations that seemed familiar, or as if they’d come from 
another lifetime, were enveloping the whole surrounding space and warming my body from within. I was afraid to move – I didn’t want them to go away. I just stood there and 
looked at a corner of the square. At a corner that was shaped like a little white home with a window and a door.</p><p>I’d begun to come to, when I heard the voice of Anastasia, 
who’d walked up. She addressed Volodya who, kneeling, was smoothing out the uneven parts of the outer wall with his hands.</p><p>“May I ask you something, my dear son?” Anastasia 
seemed agitated to me.</p><p>Volodya stood up, went up to Anastasia, gave her a slight bow and replied:</p><p>“I’m happy to listen to you, Mama.”</p><p>“Have you found a new definition for the 
concept of a ‘home’?”</p><p>“I’ve been trying to seek one out, Mama, and I decided that a person should simultaneously build a home for both himself and his hectare. Then they will 
be inseparably connected to each other and united in their space.”</p><p>“Tell me about your mock-up, Volodya, and about how it is meant to function. Tell me about all its 
details.”</p><p>“All right, Mama, I’ll tell you.”</p><p>And our son began to tell her. It was as if, through his telling, the conventional labels of the extraordinary family homestead came 
to life in the mock-up.</p><p>Volodya pointed to a depression in the wall. “This here is the entrance to the home, Mama. It’s located not on the road side, but the forest side.”</p><p>“You 
mean to say that this is the entrance to the territory of the family homestead,” Anastasia clarified.</p><p>“The entire family homestead is the home,” Volodya replied, “and for that 
reason I called it the entrance to the home. And the person should wipe his feet before he walks in, if something has stuck to them, and even if nothing has, he needs to do 
this mentally.</p><p>“Now this wall,” Volodya said, pointing to the greenhouse running along the hectare’s perimeter, “is the living wall of the home. The plants growing inside it 
will be warm and happy. This is a clay wall, heated by the rays of the sun that pass through glass – or the transparent plastic sheeting Papa has spoken of – from above. 
During the day, the clay wall will heat up, and during the night, when it’s cool, it will begin giving off warmth to everything growing inside.</p><p>“There are rooms inside this 
wall. It’s a place where various garden supplies and tools the person will use will be stored. And in this space, Mama,” Volodya said, pointing to an oval extending out from 
the homestead’s perimeter, “a person can sleep and eat in the winter.</p><p>“Next, there’s a compartment where the firewood is kept. The various domestic animals – chickens, swans, 
a goat, a pony, a hedgehog, peacocks and doves – are housed amongst the corners of the living wall that abuts the forest. There are two exits from their dwelling, one in the 
direction of the forest, the other into the home space. Papa has said that he often has to go away, and there won’t be anyone to look after the animals. Papa feels a person 
shouldn’t take on animals if he can’t give them enough attention and feed them at the right time. But I feel that animals shouldn’t have to depend on the person for food, 
that that demeans the animals. The person should create a comfortable dwelling land for the animals he likes, so that they can feed themselves independently and come to the 
person when he needs them. Many various wild animals live around our glade – our home – but there’s no need for us to feed them. On the contrary, they are happy to bring us 
food. I infer that we can create the very same conditions for animals on the family homestead, too, especially if it abuts a forest.”</p><p>“It’s possible,” Anastasia said 
thoughtfully, and continued asking our son questions. “Volodya, on the road side, at the corners, there are two little homes with small windows. What are they for?”</p><p>“Mama, I 
designed this for Papa. I know that Papa’s best childhood memories are connected to the time he spent living as a little boy with his grandmother and grandfather, in a little 
whitewashed clay hut with a straw roof. I built the little walls of this little village hut. I think it will be really good if Papa’s homestead has other elements, too, that 
will call up pleasant memories from his life.”</p><p>I quickly turned to the white… I began studying it. And I recognized it – my childhood home. I recognized the little whitewashed 
Ukrainian hut with a straw roof, with a little window and a door, and a little old bench beside it. I wanted to rush to my son and hug him, and then the pleasant sensations 
enveloped me anew and wouldn’t let me move from my spot. All I could do was to say:</p><p>“Thank you, my dear son. It all really does look like it – the little window and the little 
bench, and the door.”</p><p>“The door to your little childhood house opens, Papa. If you open it, you’ll immediately be inside the covered perimeter of your homestead, and you can 
pass through it, to wherever you want to go.</p><p>“And Papa, I’ve also arranged various plants on the homestead space and have composed the necessary symbols out of them.</p><p>“In the 
greenhouse, Papa, you can grow everything you like to eat in the spring and summer, but in addition to your favorite vegetables and fruits, it will be very good if you set up 
raised beds no more than eleven meters apart and with a diameter of no less than ninety centimeters. On these beds you’ll put in seedlings of, for example, currant and 
raspberry, and it would be good to put in at least one little cedar seedling on each side, along with grasses and flowers you’ve brought there from the taiga. And it’s 
desirable for them to come not from the edge of the taiga, but from deep inside it.”</p><p>“It will be extremely difficult for people to do that, Volodya. Now me – I can do that, 
but I’d like a lot of other people who are building family homesteads to have this option, too. A lot of them won’t be able to put in plants from deep inside the taiga.</p><p>“There 
are no roads in the taiga, you can’t use public transportation, and you can’t carry much out on our own, and then you still have to spend a long time hauling it back on 
public transportation. All of this will require no small financial expenditure. And when you add it all up, the plants you deliver from Siberia will cost significantly more 
than ones that are grown in nurseries and sold right on site or not far away. You know, there’s even a saying: ‘For a cow abroad you you’ll pay a penny, plus a hundred for 
her delivery.’ And besides that, can you explain why you should get plants from deep in the taiga, when you can dig them up in your local forest or get them from your nearest 
nursery?”</p><p>“But those will be different plants, Papa. After all, you yourself have told me about how, for example, the milk agaric mushrooms that grow here and that you can eat 
raw differ significantly from the milk agaric mushrooms that grow in the region of Russia you call the central region. The cowberries, too, differ. And Papa, the currants and 
raspberries differ, too. You yourself have written in your books, Papa, that scientists have spoken of this, too, such as the academician Pallas.”</p><p>“Tell me, Volodya, is the 
way they taste the only reason we need to fill these raised beds with plants from deep in the taiga?”</p><p>“That’s not the only reason, Papa. Taiga plants will not admit the anti-
rational information of that world in which you have to live. When they’re set out along the perimeter, they will not let that information through onto the territory of the 
homestead. Local plants, which you call regionalized, have gotten used to it to a greater degree and will let it through. In particular, plants that do not produce seeds 
provide no barrier whatsoever to this information.”</p><p>“I know about that kind of plants. They’re called genetically modified.”</p><p>“Papa, it’s important for the perimeter of the 
homestead to be able to not let unnecessary, hostile information you don’t need through when it transports you to another spot.”</p><p>I didn’t understand what my son had said and 
began asking him to clarify:</p><p>“To what other spot? How can it transport me?”</p><p>Volodya didn’t have a chance to reply. Anastasia, who was having a hard time concealing her 
agitation, began to speak:</p><p>“You’ve come up with something very good, my dear son. It’s very important to concentrate positive emotions on the homestead. And, by wiping your 
feet when you enter, to not bring the negative onto it.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1031>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>31. The Burning Blood of the Ancestors

agitated she was, and I glanced at her face. Anastasia was looking into the center of the homestead mock-up. I also looked into its center. Nothing special there. Unless the 
little white sticks arranged in the center had caught her attention. Once again she asked our son a question.</p><p>“Tell me, my dear son, what does the white circle located in the 
center of the homestead represent?”</p><p>I began explaining, instead of my son. “It represents a small, round greenhouse. That’s what Volodya and I decided on. Our little white 
sticks represent some kind of transparent material – glass, for example, or polycarbonate, or plastic sheeting. For a long time we couldn’t stick it anywhere. It didn’t go 
with anything. But now that Volodya has placed a greenhouse along the whole perimeter of the homestead, I really like it. Here you get both a greenhouse and a fence at the 
same time, and various utility rooms, too. And I also like it that Volodya made a small, round greenhouse in the center, too. Now it fits. Now it even goes really well with 
the whole perimeter of the homestead.”</p><p>“I think that what we have in the center is not a greenhouse, Vladimir,” Anastasia said in a whisper, slightly agitated, as before.</p><p>Volodya heard her and calmly said, addressing me:</p><p>“Mama’s correct. The little white sticks in the center of the homestead do not represent a greenhouse.”</p><p>“They what do they 
represent?” I asked our son.</p><p>“In the center of the homestead, Papa, I have placed a circle of mirroring water.”</p><p>I asked him to clarify. “Is it a mirror, or what?”</p><p>“You can put 
it that way. A mirror with mirroring water,” Volodya calmly replied.</p><p>“Hmm. Very original, actually. You’ve situated a round mirror on a small rise in the center of the 
homestead. The clouds are reflected in it, and the sun and moon can admire themselves in it. And streaks of sunlight will fly off it and go dancing throughout the whole 
homestead. There’s nothing like it in any landscape design, and I’ve looked through a lot of them. Very original.”</p><p>“You’ve stuck little red leaves around the mirror, Volodya. 
What do they represent?” Anastasia asked, speaking quickly.</p><p>“That’s a flame burning, Mama.”</p><p>“Where did the flame come from?”</p><p>“From oil and gas, Mama.”</p><p>After this answer, 
Anastasia squeezed my hand a bit more strongly and asked our son the following question:</p><p>“Did they allow you to light their blood on fire, Volodya?”</p><p>“Yes. The Souls of our 
ancestors allowed me to light their earthly blood on fire, Mama. If they had not wanted this, then what came to me wouldn’t have come to me.”</p><p>Suddenly Anastasia’s grandfather 
spoke, and I could sense agitation in his voice, too. “Perhaps that’s enough of distracting a person from important business. After all, you haven’t done all you’re going to 
do with the mock-up yet, have you Volodya?”</p><p>“No, I haven’t done all I’m going to do, Grandfather.”</p><p>“Then go on and do all you’re going to do, and no one will bother you.”</p><p>“Yes, 
go on and do all you’re going to do, Volodya. We’ll get out of your way for now,” Anastasia added and led me off to the side, away from the extraordinary family homestead 
design. When she’d sat herself down near the trunk of a large cedar, I asked:</p><p>“Anastasia, I can feel that you’re agitated for some reason. Am I right?”</p><p>“Yes, Vladimir, I’m 
agitated. Much of what our son is doing does not exist on earth today. Nor is there information about it in the Universe, either. That, which he has created in the center of 
the homestead – you called it beautiful and original. But it is not those words, not only those words, that describe what has been created. The construction Volodya told us 
about is an apparatus, and the main component of the apparatus is of unheard-of power, a biological mechanism. I can sense this, but I can not find a precise word to describe 
its properties. Perhaps such a word does not yet exist. We can only speculate about this device’s capacities, its unheard-of capabilities. But please, Vladimir, do not rush 
me. Allow me to gradually come to an understanding of what I have seen.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1032>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>32. A Gift from the First

together, form a unified whole. It is possible, that the homestead is a biological device or mechanism, or something else previously unimagined by consciousness. We have to 
think. We have to solve this riddle. The elongated oval of your hectare is framed with an earthen mound with clay edges. The mound is covered over with some sort of 
transparent material. Inside are various plants. There must be something significant in them.”</p><p>“Volodya said the plants can be ordinary ones, vegetables, for example, 
tomatoes, cucumbers, and various green, leafy plants. Basically, everything a person wants to eat. But you have to put in raised beds with a diameter of about ninety 
centimeters, spaced no less than eleven meters apart. On these beds you have to put out plants from deep in the taiga, because they won’t let the information of anti-
rationality through. That’s what he was saying.”</p><p>“Yes, they won’t let it through. In this way, the perimeter functions as a membrane.”</p><p>“A membrane for what?”</p><p>“For everything 
located inside the membrane. The greenhouse situated along the perimeter, where all the areas a person requires for living and for his household needs have been incorporated, 
looks pretty and sensible. Within a few years, the need for the transparent dome will fall away. The most important thing remaining will be what is growing strong and firm 
beneath it. Our son has pursued quite an extraordinary goal. He has fenced the homestead space off from the pernicious influence of the anti-world and anti-rationality, using 
the most powerful fence you can possibly imagine. It is not the clay walls and the transparent dome that play the most important role in this fence, but the plants inside the 
structure. They will exert a psychological effect simply by being there, and they will help you immediately bring opposites into balance within you.”</p><p>“How will they help me 
bring opposites into balance within me? That’s some kind of mysticism, or magic.”</p><p>“There’s not a jot of mysticism or magic here, Vladimir. Rather, it’s science, the one you 
call psychology. Imagine: you drive up to your homestead, and from far off you can see the little white walls of the little home of your childhood, and this immediately calls 
up positive emotions in you. Then you get out of the car and wipe off your feet, once more mentally cleansing yourself of negative information. The gates open wide before 
you, and your gaze takes in the living magnificence of your family homestead’s space, which will never cease to amaze and delight you. Unlike a non-living picture, it will 
always be varied. New flowers have blossomed on the raised beds and trees, and the light playing in a new way, or the little flowers stirred by the breeze will enchant you 
each time. Then you will want to take a look at whatever might be transpiring inside the fence, and you’ll go into it. Its beautiful living richness and its airs will 
completely draw you away from the negative information of the anti-world.”</p><p>“Yes, it really is great. The homestead will also play the role of my personal psychologist, and an 
extremely effective one at that. You’re right, Anastasia – each time I come back even to my country home after being gone for three or four days, each time it’s interesting 
to look at what’s changed in the garden, in the beds and in the greenhouse.</p><p>“Now, of course you can’t compare a country home to the homestead you’re talking about. Of course, 
it’s much more effective. Look how much one bird on the bank of a pond means to us. Wow, to come up with something like that. It all started with an ordinary bath house, and 
it ended up with a magnificent and functional sculpture. Now I understand that it will also have a very strong psychological effect.”</p><p>“It certainly will, Vladimir. The bird 
will greet you, both when you have only just crossed the threshold of the home, and when you light a fire, and then when you go inside the bird, so as to warm your body and 
soul.”</p><p>“Tell me, Anastasia, but why did you take such notice, or get so frightened when Volodya started telling you about the mirroring structure in the center of the 
homestead?”</p><p>“The little walls of the little white hut from your childhood, the greenhouse along the perimeter with the living organism inside, the earthen bird with the 
burning heart who strives to carry a person off into the sky… It’s possible that it is a more perfected analog… The mirror in the center, reflecting the heavenly bodies…”</p><p>Anastasia stood up and, pronouncing her words precisely, the way she always does when speaking of something significant, she said:</p><p>“Vladimir, our son has created a mock-up… He 
has constructed a biological interplanetary ship.”</p><p>“What???” I was amazed. “Anastasia, are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes. I am sure. It’s possible that we need to use a different word to 
name it. I don’t know this word as of yet. But I am sure that the intended function of what we saw is to teleport the space along with the people located in it.</p><p>“A person who 
builds a family homestead using the elements of this design will, without a doubt, be able to build his own world on a different planet, and this world will be beautiful.</p><p>“In 
the center of the homestead is located part of the apparatus a person can use to transform (to psycho-teleport, to transfer) the space along with all its contents to other 
planets and other worlds. Part of… But then where… I’ve understood it, Vladimir. Before us is a mock-up of a beautiful family homestead, and at the same time, before us is a 
mock-up of a perfected interplanetary ship. It is capable of moving at the speed of thought. Of reaching, in one instant, the Moon, Mars, or Jupiter.</p><p>“Distance is basically of 
no consequence at all for it. It can cover a distance of one meter or a distance of a million light years in one and the same amount of time. It is capable of transferring 
people onto any planet in the solar system, and beyond its bounds.”</p><p>“But Anastasia, scientists have proven that there’s no life on planets, at least not the closest ones.”</p><p>“And 
that is why, Vladimir, I said it is capable of psycho-teleporting the space along with all its contents, including the dwelling land of all that lives in that space. In other 
words, this homestead can be transferred, or to express it more precisely, the given homestead can be copied and situated on a different planet.”</p><p>“How about the people who 
live on the homestead? Will they be transferred to the different planet, too?”</p><p>“The people, too, if they are located on the homestead at the moment of transfer.”</p><p>“But if there 
isn’t any fertile soil on the other planet, or if it’s three hundred degrees, or a hundred below zero?”</p><p>“When the space is teleported, something akin to an explosion takes 
place on the planet, and as a result, the existence of the new space is secured.”</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1033>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>33. Teleporting 
the Space</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>“Unbelievable information, Anastasia. It’s even hard to imagine that such potentials exist 
in man. Perhaps you’re mistaken in your conjectures?”</p><p>“These are no longer conjectures, Vladimir, and I am not the tiniest bit mistaken. Previously this information did not 
exist in the Universe. Now it has appeared. But what is most important, is that the particle of mankind’s first civilization, which exists within me and within you, just as 
it does in each person as well, will allow this information in.”</p><p>“You know, Anastasia, I’m only just now starting to understand how mighty those four words of the Universal 
law are: PERFECT THE DWELLING LAND. Turns out a person can perfect his land to such a degree that he becomes a god. I mean, because when he moves to another planet that 
hasn’t yet been made habitable, man will begin creating life there, like God did on earth.”</p><p>“Man will never become a god, Vladimir. Each person is the son of God, or his 
daughter. And God, the creator and parent, wanted his children to be more perfected than he himself, and they most certainly will be, they will be! By bringing anti-
rationality and Rationality into balance within themselves.”</p><p>We heard the voice of Anastasia’s grandfather, who had come up without us noticing him. “Now that is real 
scientific progress. He will open up a new era for mankind.”</p><p>Anastasia stood up. Her grandfather, an elder with graying hair, but an erect posture, stood there, leaning on his 
staff and looking thoughtfully at the shore of the taiga lake.</p><p>“Granddad, are you speaking of Volodya’s design?” Anastasia asked her grandfather.</p><p>“What can one possibly say 
when an epiphany comes? Throughout the millennia, he or they, – it’s unimportant, which– have turned the living teachings of messiahs and scientific luminaries into 
incoherent gobbledygook. He has shown the potentials of people living on the earth. He has created a new image of man. Or has brought back the man who was called the son of 
God. A man capable, like unto God, of creating on lifeless planets a life more beautiful than earthly life.”</p><p>“People will have a hard time believing something like that,” I 
remarked to Grandfather.</p><p>“Fine. Even if someone doesn’t believe, then what of it? What remains for an unbeliever who doesn’t believe in his might? To be born? Yes! But to what 
end, if the ensuing life is meaningless, if it is death? And then again the question: to what end was he born?</p><p>“For millions of years, there has existed a multitude of 
teachings. And all about one and the same thing, that mankind should live in expectation of receiving something from someone. And mankind has done so, closing off its thought 
and rationality. It has not thought about why and to what end the Universe lights up the stars above man.”</p><p>“And now what? Will our son become a messiah?” Anastasia said 
bitterly. “He will have difficulty holding his ground in the face of pridefulness. What’s more, the anti-rationality will rush to seek him out.”</p><p>Everyone fell silent and, for 
some reason, simultaneously turned in the direction of the homestead mock-up. At the same time, Volodya was heading toward us, walking with a calm gait. He was carrying 
Nastenka. She was hugging him around the neck and pressing her cheek to his. Volodya stopped a few steps away from us and set Nastenka down on the ground. He bowed to us all 
and began to speak:</p><p>“Mama. Don’t worry, Mama. I know that if I become a messiah, then people will direct their thought to me, with hope. And that means that they will not be 
directing their thought fully to creating.”</p><p>“What have you decided to do, Volodya?” Anastasia asked our son.</p><p>“I need to go. I will dissolve, insignificant, in the human 
crowd.”</p><p>After these words, Volodya looked each of us, in turn, in the eye. The thought flashed in my mind that he was intending to leave forever. And as he was looking at me, 
I said:</p><p>“Thank you, dear son, for your extraordinary, marvelous family homestead design. This will be the very best gift for my sixtieth birthday. And, really, the very best 
gift I’ve received in the sixty years I’ve lived.”</p><p>“Papa, this design is a gift not just for you. I give it to all the readers of your books. Let them take from it all that 
they wish to take.”</p><p>“Let it be for all of them. That means, it’s for me, too.”</p><p>“I want to give you a separate gift, Papa.”</p><p>At these words, Volodya slipped his hand beneath his 
shirt, took something out and held his hand out to me. I watched as he slowly and carefully opened his fingers, uncovering the gift that lay in his hand. But when Volodya had 
fully opened his fingers, there was nothing on his palm. I looked at Grandfather, then at Anastasia, trying, with their help, to understand what my son’s gesture meant, and 
how I was supposed to respond to it, but they said nothing.</p><p>“Papa, go ahead and take my gift to you,” Volodya repeated.</p><p>I kept standing there, not understanding how you can 
take what you can’t see. Suddenly Nastenka walked up to me, took me by the hand and led me over to Volodya. When I came up to my son, I stretched my hand out toward his hand. 
He carefully placed something invisible into my palm.</p><p>It, this something invisible, was pulsating and slightly warming my hand. I closed my fingers and placed the gift beneath 
my shirt, in the same spot Volodya had kept it. A tender and extraordinary warmth enveloped my whole body.</p><p>“It will live in your home, Papa, and when you’ve built the 
homestead perimeter, ask it to fill the space.”</p><p>Volodya bowed deeply to everyone, then turned around and began moving away from us, his steps confident. Then he suddenly 
vanished beyond the bushes, or dissolved in the space. And we all stood there, as if spellbound, and both when he looked each of us in the eye and when he was walking off, 
all we all did was to silently follow him with our eyes. And then I said:</p><p>“Anastasia, I got the impression our son has left us forever.”</p><p>Hearing no reply, I turned toward 
Anastasia. She was looking in the direction in which Volodya had headed off. Her body was shaking. A thin stream of scarlet blood was flowing from her lower lip. She had 
bitten her lip, so as to not cry out. I understood. This meant the anti-rationality would hunt our son, and Anastasia and me, as well. I saw Anastasia’s hands clenching into 
fists. The taiga froze. Some unknown sound resembling the rumbling of something huge was filling the space. I got the impression that the huge space was compressing and, when 
it opened back up, it might wipe everything from the face of the earth.</p><p>I had already witnessed this kind of phenomenon before, when I’d lost consciousness while trying to 
possess Anastasia against her will, and also when I’d tried to strike her with the stick because she wouldn’t agree to give our son to me to raise. Each time it started, 
Anastasia would raise her hands upward, as if waving to someone in greeting, and everything would calm down, before any sound even appeared. But now the sound was growing 
louder and louder, and Anastasia was not raising her hand upward. And I didn’t want her to raise it. On the contrary. I wanted this invisible and mighty thing to thunder and 
wipe from the earth all the filth that had accumulated on it.</p><p>But Anastasia raised her hand. The space began to calm down.</p><p>Before leaving the taiga glade, I went once more to 
the shore of the lake. I stood there alone and looked at the homestead mock-up our son had created, and I imagined it actually existing on my hectare that for now was 
overgrown only with tall weeds. Here I am, driving up in my car. I see the two white walls with little windows from my happy childhood. The gates swing open automatically, 
revealing a living picture of the finery inside, and I drive toward the entrance to the home. Stop! What the heck am I doing? I’m driving through all this magnificence in a 
roaring car! Through my own home! Go back!</p><p>I leave my car at the entrance. The gates swing open, and I wipe my shoes, trying to wipe the filth of another world from my soles. 
Then I remove my shoes and leave them by the entrance and walk barefoot through my beautiful world to the pond, where there are swans swimming. My cat and dog are run 
alongside me. In the distance, a rooster crows in greeting from one corner, and in another, a little goat bleats. And by the pond, on the sand, my grandsons and 
granddaughters are constructing mock-ups of their own family homesteads. And the woman I love, her beauty never fading, comes out of the garden, smiles at me and waves her 
hand in greeting.</p><p>When it gets darker and the stars begin appearing in the sky, all the windows of the oval space will light up with a joyful light. Lamps will come on in the 
greenhouse and show the stars the living magnificence growing inside it. The stars will think, “There, on Earth, a very small point is glowing with an extraordinary 
luminosity. It is no bigger than one hectare, but its light caresses us.” The stars are not yet aware that there will soon be more and more points like that on the earth. And 
the whole earth will start shining with a blessed light and will caress the expanses of the Universe with it.</p><p>I made a firm decision to make the homestead mock-up my son had 
created a reality. And perhaps it was a good thing that I’d gotten a hectare with unproductive soil, where the water takes a long time to run off in the spring. But I will 
take it and make its soil fertile, make it into the kind of soil trees will bloom on in the garden, and flowers. I will perfect the dwelling land in that spot.</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter id=1034>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>34. A Letter to my Son</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>Hello, Volodya.</p><p>I don’t know where you are now, and so I decided to write you a letter through my book. I sometimes write you letters, but I have no idea where to send them. 
But something I publish in a book – I think you’ll read that. A book makes its way into many countries. It’s like a living thing. It can find various people all on its own, 
and perhaps it will find you, too.</p><p>In September of 2009 I set about creating my family homestead according to your design. I don’t know who will live on it. Maybe you’ll want 
to, or Nastenka, when she gets older. There should come a time soon, when the representatives of anti-rationality will not hinder people like you. Maybe my grandchildren will 
want to live here, or my great-grandchildren. The moment has come, when I feel an urgent need to bring what you designed to life.</p><p>I ploughed my hectare with a tractor and 
sowed winter rye on it. I sowed the seed by hand myself, and my neighbors helped me. I used an excavator to make the earthen mound all along the perimeter, a meter high and a 
meter and a half wide. I didn’t have time to make the little clay walls this year – the rains and the cold weather set in. I’ll start building them in the spring. But my 
hectare has been transformed even just from what I’ve done this year. It’s the only one framed with an earthen mound, and the rye has grown up in place of the former weeds. 
It even seems to me that it’s showing off a little bit before the neighboring hectares.</p><p>I also managed to dig the pond this year – about thirty meters in diameter, and it will 
fill with water in the spring.</p><p>I also bought up various fruit tree saplings. For now I’ve put them in on the grounds of my country home. I’m planning to move them to the 
homestead next fall.</p><p>During the winter I’m going to have to decide how to make your fiery bird. I don’t think molding it out of clay should pose any particular problems, but 
how do I fire it then, so the rains don’t wash it away? And besides, too, it’s about three meters high, and in addition then you have the wingspan, which works out to about 
twelve meters. Then the thought came to me that I need to mold it out of clay, then saw it into sections and fire it at a factory. And after that I can reassemble the fiery 
bird on my homestead, on the bank of the pond.</p><p>I’ve shown your creation to my friends – I just drew them a clay capsule with a fire inside and explained how you can warm and 
heal yourself inside it, or just sit outside in front of the fire with your friends the way you’d do with an inside fireplace. And they decided they want to build something 
like that at their places, too. Can you imagine how delighted they’ll be when they find out it’s not just a capsule you can warm your body and heal yourself in, but a 
beautiful bird, too, with a burning heart inside?</p><p>How in the world were you able to create such a miraculous thing?</p><p>Anastasia surmises that the people of the first earthly 
civilization are helping you. If that’s the case, then why shouldn’t they help everyone who’s set about building their family homesteads? However, on the other hand, since 
you’ve given your design to all the readers, then they really have helped everyone.</p><p>Oh, and Volodya, your mama also said that your family homestead design is a great and 
beautiful missive to mankind from some civilization that’s unknown to contemporary people. Whether it’s on a different planet or in a different dimension – that’s not 
important. It’s entered into communication with contemporary people, and in the language of matter, too. And the contemporary society of people stands on the threshold of 
great and beautiful transformations.</p><p>When your mama said this, I didn’t yet fully sense the significance of her words. But later on, when I was reflecting about them, I became 
convinced that she is totally correct. You know, Volodya, there’s a lot of talk in society about UFOs, about visitors from other planets, and we have no small number of 
treatises, of all possible kinds, supposedly written by great teachers, but what concrete results do we have from them?</p><p>Nothing changes. People have been moving along their 
path, heading toward a sad end, and that’s just the path they keep on following. A picture even came to me.</p><p>People are walking along a road and there’s someone dressed very 
oddly standing on the side of the road. And, as if to underscore his strangeness, he’s yelling:</p><p>“I’m a visitor from afar. I’m a visitor from afar, a representative of great 
powers.”</p><p>“Well, so what?” people say to him. “What will you bestow on us? If you’re a representative of great powers, then take drug addiction from the earth, and prostitution 
and wars, and take the various illnesses away, too.”</p><p>“You don’t understand. I’m a visitor from afar…”</p><p>But he couldn’t pique people’s interest. Only one person came up to him.</p><p>“If you’re some great visitor from afar, then you probably won’t have any trouble giving me a hundred rubles for a bottle of vodka.”</p><p>And he got this answer:</p><p>“I’m a great 
visitor from afar. You need to listen to me, give me shelter and food, even make a great fuss over me.”</p><p>That’s more or less the back story with all the “great visitors from 
afar” who have come to earth.</p><p>But things are totally different in the case of your design, Volodya.</p><p>Without saying who he was, without asking for a thing, he simply offered: 
“Take a look, people, and if you like it, take it and be happy.”</p><p>And when you left, Volodya, Mama spent a long time looking over your homestead mock-up with great attention.</p><p>She said it’s extraordinary, lovely and multi-functional, but that it’s not a simple homestead. The details of its separate parts are closely interconnected, and all of them 
together are actually an interplanetary biological apparatus that is capable of moving a person – along with his dwelling land – to any planet, all in the space of one 
instant.</p><p>This apparatus’ ultrastrong biological membrane extends along the homestead’s perimeter. The fiery bird is programmed to cleanse one of viruses. The internal 
arrangement and selection of plants suggest an eternal life-support system for those living inside this apparatus. The object with the mirrored water is, pure and simple, a 
launch button that initiates the biological program.</p><p>The propulsion device of this apparatus is unsurpassed in terms of its generating capacity. It goes beyond the boundaries 
of specifications like rate of movement, for what lies at its core is unmediated human thought.</p><p>Anastasia also said that all technocratic inventions have a biological analog – 
or the other way around, to be more precise. And this biological analog is more perfected. Now, we, by using achievements in space exploration and in the sphere of computer 
technology as a launch point, can define the significance of those separate details of yours. I think that readers who happen to be programmers will comprehend more of what 
you have done.</p><p>But here’s what’s bothering me, Volodya. The perimeter is a membrane. The fiery bird is a cleansing, anti-viral program. The mirror in the center with the 
torches is a launch button. I’ll make all of this, and maybe somebody else will make it, too. But there aren’t any instructions for how everyone is supposed to use this. All 
devices always come with instructions, so people don’t break the devices or hurt themselves. And here we’ve got significant biological technology, and without instructions. A 
person might accidentally do something with the launch button, and his family will wake up on another planet, without even intending to do so. They’ll want to come back, but 
they’ll have no idea how.</p><p>I bought an octagonal mirror and torches. Out at my country home, in the evening, I placed this mirror on the ground and lit the torches around it, 
and it turned out really beautiful. But, I think it’s not totally safe to do that in your garden in the autumn. When the mirror poured out water, it felt like the trees were 
trying to come back to life. But deep in the autumn, they shouldn’t come back to life.</p><p>I’m really sorry I didn’t have a chance to talk a little more with you, Volodya and ask 
you to clarify the intended purpose of this apparatus, what it’s for, and how we’re supposed to use it. Maybe the readers will be able to figure it out, or it will come to me 
later on, once I get it in place on my hectare.</p><p>Now, I probably won’t be able to build the greenhouse around the perimeter of the homestead next year. I don’t have the money 
to do everything all at once. We’re hardly getting any royalties at all from America.</p><p>Basically, I don’t get what’s going on over there – they’re making some kind of changes 
to the books without my permission. The domain name “Ringing Cedars” in English belongs to somebody. And can you imagine – they even have the domain name “Vladimir Megre” 
there, and a site with that name, and it’s being passed off as my official site. But I have no connection to it whatsoever. Polina’s tried to register the trademark in my 
name, and they asked her to pay six thousand dollars.</p><p>I wouldn’t really care, but I feel bad for the readers. What are they being told on these sites? What products are being 
sold using those trademarks and logo? How can I sort it out? Where can I find the time to sort things out?</p><p>But I decided that in my new book I’ll give the name of a website 
where people can communicate directly with Polina. And to ask Polina to publish the new book in English, too. But so far I don’t know how to get it published in the English-
speaking countries.</p><p>And something else, Volodya – I have a problem. We have to come up with a comprehensible and concise appeal to those in power in various countries. The 
goal of the appeal is to encourage each one of them to take whatever forceful measures they can to perfect the dwelling land on the earth. I’ve put together various versions 
of this message, but it always seems to me I could do it in a simpler, shorter and more convincing fashion. Here’s the latest version. Maybe it’ll do? What do you think?</p><p>An 
Appeal</p><p>Dear Sirs:</p><p>I have written a series of books called “The Ringing Cedars of Russia.” Many of these books’ readers – people of various ages, nationalities, religious faiths 
and social statuses – are each acquiring one hectare of land for their families and are establishing family homesteads on them. Among them number doctoral students and PhDs, 
as well as simple workers. Ninety percent of these people have a college education and profound life experience. Each family on its own and everyone as a group – they are 
creating a dwelling land for themselves, their children and future generations that is more livable in all respects. In Russia and in the countries of the former Soviet 
Union, these people have already created more than fifteen hundred settlements made up of family homesteads, without any government support whatsoever. They include large 
settlements, with up to three hundred families, and small ones, formed by ten to fifteen families.</p><p>I do not know how many people are taking similar steps – whether united in 
small groups, or for the most part on their own – in other countries where my books in the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series are being published. But they do exist, and their 
numbers are growing steadily.</p><p>Dear Sirs, people have talked a great deal in the world about the need to improve the ecological situation on the earth. In certain regions, this 
situation has already reached a critical stage, and a global disaster looms. For some time, now, conferences and symposia have been held at the governmental level with many 
countries, the UN and all possible NGOs. But, dear Sirs, where have we seen even the slightest result? The earth’s ecology continues to worsen.</p><p>The only people taking real 
steps are the people who are founding their own family homesteads, people focused on improving man’s dwelling land.</p><p>Dear Sirs, I am not asking you to discuss the merits or 
weaknesses of my books or me personally.</p><p>I am asking you to examine the actual idea, from the position of rational thought. And if you are unable, by drawing on contemporary 
science, to propose anything more effective than this idea, I ask you to recognize its essence and accept it.”</p><p>I don’t know to whom specifically I should address this appeal.</p><p>I’d also like to touch on another serious question. I often think about it. I try to find a solution. The thing is, Volodya, that given your approach to life and the way you 
understand the meaning of existence, it will be hard for you to find a bride, a girl who understands you.</p><p>You probably already know that from the time they’re little, many 
girls dream of becoming an actress or a model, or of marrying a wealthy man and going to resorts and having a maid at home. If you suddenly take a liking to that kind of 
girl, a girl who hasn’t read the books and hasn’t heard anything about family homesteads – after all, love is unpredictable – now, don’t go trying to tell her about the 
homestead right off the bat. She won’t get it. Now, when I’ve made my homestead according to your design, then you go ahead and bring this girl there and show her this 
homestead. When you’re approaching it, you tell your girl that it’s yours, and go inside the homestead with her. Go in through the door of the white hut. The key to the door 
will always be in the spot where Grandmother used to leave it. And show her everything that’s there.</p><p>Anastasia has said that when a woman sees a more perfected dwelling land 
than the one she’s previously been in, the desire to bear a child immediately awakens within her, along with an attraction to the man who’s connected to this land.</p><p>Volodya, 
should you sense this kind of desire in your girl, then you can be certain that she will most certainly come to love you, and that her past, mindless inclinations will desert 
her.</p><p>And Volodya, your little sister Nastenka often visits your mock-up and plays in it, building little flowerbeds inside it. Anastasia says she has fervent thought. 
Anastasia has told me about Nastenka’s past life, the one when her name was Anasta.</p><p>That’s all for now. The letter has turned out kind of long, but I haven’t said everything I 
wanted to say.</p><p>Be careful. Take care of yourself, Volodya.</p><p>With all greatest respect for you,</p><p>Your papa</p><p> </p><p><div class=chapter>************************ ************************ ************************ </br><h2>
Translator's Notes</h2> ************************ ************************ ************************ </br></div></p><p> </p><p>1 Nastenka (in Russian “Настенька”, transliterated “Nasten’ka” and pronounced 
“NAH-steen-kuh”) is a diminutive form of the name Anastasia (in Russian “Анастасия”, transliterated “Anastasiya” and pronounced “Ah-nuh-stah-SEE-yuh”), used affectionately as 
a nickname.</p><p>2 The name used here in the original is “Вуд” (transliterated “Vud” and pronounced “Vood”). The origin of this name is unknown.</p><p>3 The name Anasta (in Russian 
“Анаста”, transliterated “Anasta” and pronounced “Ah-NAH-stuh”) is meant to echo the name Anastasia.</p><p>4 The Russian original is “Изор” (transliterated “Izor” and pronounced 
“Ee-zore”). This name’s origin is unknown.</p><p>5 Anastochka (in Russian “Анасточка”, transliterated “Anastochka” and pronounced “Ah-NAH-stuhch-kuh”) is a diminutive form of the 
name Anasta, used affectionately as a nickname.</p><p>6 The Russian word used here is “дом” (transliterated “dom” and pronounced “dome”). Throughout Anasta, this word both refers to 
the physical structure in which one lives and also carries the sense of a place where one can feel “at home.” I have translated this word as “home” throughout the book, so as 
to preserve both of these connotations and also the sound of the Russian original.</p><p>7 The Russian original is “Алан” (transliterated “Alan” and pronounced “Ah-LAHN”).</p><p>8 The 
Russian phrase here is “родное пространство” (transliterated “rodnoe prostranstvo” and pronounced “rahd-NOH-yuh prah-STRAHNST-vuh”). The first word has the same root as the 
first word in the phrase “родовое поместье” (transliterated “rodovoe pomest’e” and pronounced “ruhd-ah-VOH-yuh pah-MYEST-yeh”), which I have translated throughout as “family 
homestead,” and the second word, meaning “space” or “area,” occurs throughout the “Ringing Cedars of Russia” series in the phrase “пространство любви” (transliterated 
“prostranstvo lyubvi” and pronounced “prah-STRAHNST-vuh lyoob-VEE”) which means “space of love.” As such, the phrase “family space” brings together the two ideas of the 
family homestead and the space of love.</p><p>9 The Russian original is “Дан” (transliterated “Dan” and pronounced “Dahn”). This name, although similar to the Russian name Daniil, 
also has other layers of meaning, including the root expressing the meaning of something given or granted.</p><p>10 The original Russian phrase here is “среда обитания” 
(transliterated “sreda obitaniya”, pronounced “sree-DAH a-bee-TAH-nee-yuh”). It expresses of the area, space or spot in which one resides and is often rendered as “habitat.” 
However, in this book the phrase encompasses all that is part of the area where one lives as well as all the beings and energetic forces present within it. Thus, I have 
translated it throughout as “dwelling land,” as it is related to the phrase “среда обетованная” (transliterated “sreda obetovannaya” and pronounced “sree-dah ah-bee-TOH-
vahn-nah-yuh”). See note 16 below for commentary on this phrase.</p><p>11 The original Russian is “род” (transliterated “rod” and pronounced “roht”). Where “род”/“rod” occurs in the 
text, referring to the chain of family members stretching in the past or future, I have translated this using the phrase “family line.” See note 8 about other phrases in the 
book containing this same root.</p><p>12 The original Russian word, coined by Vladimir Megre, is “первоистоки” (transliterated “pervoistoki”, pronounced “pir-vah-ee-STOH-kee”). The 
roots in this word express both the idea of coming first or being in an original position, as well as the idea of flowing water and source. Hence, these are the people who 
served as the source for all others, in both the literal and figurative meanings of this word.</p><p>13 The original Russian phrase, “родовые деревья” (transliteratred “rodovye 
derev’ya”, pronounced “ruh-dah-VY-yeh di-REV’-yuh”) contains the root “род”/“rod”, relating to “family line.” Thus, I have rendered this phrase as “family trees” to establish 
the link with the phrase “family homestead.”</p><p>14 One hectare is equal to 10,000 square meters, or 2.471 acres.</p><p>15 This is equivalent to roughly 1000 U.S. dollars or 750 Euros 
(for 2010).</p><p>16 The original Russian phrase is “среда обетованная” (transliterated “sreda obetovannaya” and pronounced “sree-DAH ah-bee-TOH-vuhn-nuh-yuh”). This phrase both 
echoes the phrase “dwelling land” (“среда обитания”, transliterated “sreda obitaniya” and pronounced “sree-DAH ah-bee-TAH-nee-yuh”) and is also meant to echo the Biblical 
phrase “promised land” (in Russian “земля обетованна” (transliterated “zemlya obetovanna” and pronounced “zeem-LYAH ah-bee-TOH-vuhn-nuh”). Thus, although “среда” is often 
translated as “habitat”, I chose to translate it here as “the land around you”, so as to retain the link to both “promised land” and the word “land” in the phrase “dwelling 
land”. See note 10 for discussion of the latter phrase.</p><p>17 The original Russian here is “родовая книга” (transliterated “rodovaya kniga” and pronounced “ruh-dah-VAH-yuh KNEE-
guh”). This phrase, coined by Vladimir Megre, refers to a book that each family creates when they establish a family homestead. In the family book, family members will write 
down information about the members of the family line and about the family homestead, so that this valuable information will be preserved and handed down from generation to 
generation for centuries to come.</p><p>18 Volodya (in Russian, “Володя”, transliterated “Volodya” and pronounced “Vah-LOH-dyuh”) is a diminutive name Vladimir.</p></div>
